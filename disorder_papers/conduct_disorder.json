      "abstract": "Pembunuhan adalah tindakan yang tidak berkeprimanusiaan, karena membunuh merupakan perbuatan kesengajaan menghilangkan nyawa orang lain dengan alasan tertentu. Pembunuhan biasanya dilatarbelakangi oleh bermacam-macam motif tertentu, misalnya memilik dendam kepada orang yang telah menyakitinya, lalu si pelaku melampiaskan perbuatanya dengan membunuh orang tersebut, dan si pelaku merasa puas jika dendamnya bisa dibalas dengan cara membunuh orang tersebut. Membunuh dapat dibedakan menjadi dua hal yaitu pembunuhan berencana dan pembunuhan tidak terencana, misalnya pembunuhan berencana adalah pelaku sudah merencanakan sejak lama dan sudah menyiapkan segala sesuatu untuk menghabisi nyawa orang lain. Pembunuhan tidak terencana atau tidak terduga adalah perbuatan yang tidak disengaja dilakukan oleh orang tersebut misalnya terjadi suatu kecelakaan. Pembunuhan dapat dilakukan dengan berbagai cara seperti menggunakan senjata tajam, senjata api atau bahan peledak lainnya seperti menggunakan bom. Pembunuhan juga termasuk melanggar beberapa sila seperti pada sila pertama “yaitu “Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa “, juga pada sila kedua yaitu “kemanusiaan yang adil dan beradab”, serta juga melanggar sila yang kelima yaitu “keadilan sosial bagi seluruh rakyat Indonesia”.",

      "title": "METHODS, PATTERN AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE",
      "abstract": "The article discusses ways of committing domestic violence; traces arising after the use of one or another method and the environment in which the specified crime is committed. The methods of committing: physical violence, which consists in inflicting bodily injuries that can lead to the death of the victim, violation of physical or mental health, damage to his honor and dignity, are considered separately. Psychological violence, which is related to the effect on the psyche of a person through verbal insults or threats, harassment, intimidation, which intentionally causes emotional insecurity, the inability to protect oneself and may cause or is causing damage to mental health; economic violence, which consists in depriving a person of food, clothing and other property or funds to which the victim has a legal right, which can lead to his death, cause a violation of physical or mental health. Traces of domestic violence are considered in a broad sense, namely, traces of struggle: a mess in the room, overturned furniture, broken glass, dishes, scattered clothes, etc. It has been established that the traces of domestic violence can be material and ideal. Ideal traces of domestic violence are formed in the memory of the participants of the criminal event. The types of identified traces are specified in relation to the method of committing the crime. When analyzing the situation of domestic violence, it was established that its structure includes the place and time of the crime, the moral and psychological relations of the subjects of the offense and their environment, the social and psychological environment in which the offender is located and influences his actions, as well as the socio-political situation in the country.",

      "title": "[Aggression in peer groups during the second year of life].",
      "abstract": "1. Very little is known about the behaviour of children in their second year and even less in their Peer-group. Aggressive behaviour among peers seems to be established at this age and it is interesting to observe it within the Peer-groups. 2. A useful definition of aggression seems to be the following one: Aggression is any physical contact, direct or indirect, by which another person is hurt. 3. We observe five different forms of aggression: 3.1 Aggression by chance, without any aim, happening out of awkwardness and motoric clumsiness. This kind of aggression becomes rarer during the second year. 3.2 Manipulating one another, as shaking arm or leg of another child, pulling his hair, tapping his body and so on, giving the impression of the aggressor exploring his partner. This kind of aggression also becomes rarer during the second year. 3.3 Robbery of objects, i.e. toys being in the hands of another; the reaction of the victim is increasing during the second year. 3.4 Aggression in order to control the group and to establish leadership in connection with the development of a group hierarchy. 3.5 Pathologic Aggression, observed on a child of the group with brain dysfunction. The child overthrows others from behind, climbs on them and bites them in the ear, the neck or the cheek. 4. We still need more observation on Peer-groups of this age to know more about the beginning and development of the here described phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Severe trauma affects all structures of the self – one's image of the body; the internalized images of the others; and one's values and ideals – and leads to a sense that the self-coherence and self-continuity are invaded, assaulted, and systematically broken down. The traumatic events overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life and generally involve threats to life or bodily integrity, confront human beings with the extremities of helplessness and terror, and evoke the response of catastrophe. The vulnerable self-structure of traumatized individuals is evident in the following ways: (a) difficulties in self-regulation (self-esteem maintenance, lower tolerance levels, and the sense of self-discontinuity and personal agency), (b) appearance of the clinical symptomatology (frequent upsurges of anxiety/fear, depression, and specific fears or phobias regarding the external world or one's own bodily integrity), and (c) reliance on primitive or less-developed forms of the self-object relatedness. Severe trauma may lead to de-centering of the self (self-at-worst), loss of groundlessness and a sense of sameness, self-discontinuity and ego-fragility, leaving scars on the one's 'inner agency' of the psyche, fragmentation of the ego-identity resulting in proneness to dissociation.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundIt is sad to see time and time again how information on the seriousness and dangerousness of animal cruelty goes unnoticed or is minimized when intervention and prosecution occurs.Research from the 1980's to the present has demonstrated that cruelty to animals is a hallmark or signature indicator for future acts of violence, including rape, child molestation, domestic abuse, school shootings, and other forms of violence.If someone can be abusive or cruel to animals, then it makes sense that they could and often do become aggressive and violent towards people.Animal cruelty is defined as the crime involving the infliction of pain, suffering, or death to an animal.Animal neglect can include withholding of food and water and shelter and that as a result the animal has in any way suffered, died, or been placed in imminent danger of death (animal cruelty, n.d.).In short, anything that is done to mistreat an animal.People who engage in animal cruelty are monsters.What does it take to abuse or neglect a living and gentle pet?The answer is simply monstrous and evil intentions. Definition of animal cruelty2][3] The terms animal cruelty and animal abuse will be used interchangeably in this article. Definition of domestic violenceThe term domestic violence will include any act of emotional, psychological, physical, or sexual abuse or neglect that occur within a family unit, regardless of the relationship between the adults and children.Intimate partner violence will be used interchangeably with domestic abuse, partner abuse, dating violence, any relationship violence between romantic partners.",

      "title": "Inverse Psychological Projection",
      "abstract": "Potential competing interests: No potential competing interests to declare.Freud (1894) defined \"psychological projection\" as a defense mechanism in which one attributes negative aspects of their personality to others and is thus able to ignore their own flaws and problems.Its inverse form is defined as follows: when a person repeatedly (sometimes angrily) advises another person to ignore or pay no attention to either someone or something, it is usually because the person who advises this is experiencing inverse psychological projection; that is, if this person's needs have been disregarded in the past, their experience will be reflected in their reaction to the person they advise.However, such advice is relevant only when the type of hurt is a very specific case of banal mockery.If a mentally ill person tells somebody they are ugly, the best advice is to ignore them.However, if this person hurts someone in a way that has nothing to do with banal mockery of self-image (e.g., public humiliation, contempt, invasion of privacy, incitement, threatening behavior, discrimination, abuse, sexual or ordinary harassment, violence, annoyance) or if what was said had already hurt the other, then advising them to ignore or pay no attention to that mentally ill person disregards this damage.This defense mechanism can be activated in a person if they have been unable to cope with similar types of hurt in their own past and have been exposed to related mental damage, if their egoism is stimulated by the same matter, or if, due to this stimulation, it is either shameful for them to acknowledge their egoism because stimulated (or vulnerable) egoism is considered socially inferior or difficult for them to contain the other's hurt feelings or bruised egoism.Consequently, they deny the problem's existence and thus advise others to also ignore it due to their will to either stimulate (and unburden) their antagonism to others or to demonstrate their ability to rise above the same issue and \"win\" against it.Moreover, in contrast to classic psychological projection, in which a person attributes negative aspects of their own personality to others when they are unable to deal with these aspects (so they can ignore them), in its inverse form, a person attributes the quality that they would like to but cannot demonstrate/be able to succeed in (which relates to their ability to efficiently manage things or problems that stimulate their own egoism), so they can avoid dealing with these things or problems.In similar scenarios, inverse psychological projection may include saying things such as \"I don't care what you think (or say)/Who cares what people think (or say),\" \"Don't get excited by the background noise,\" I will not stoop to your level,\" \"Don't let them influence you,\" \"Don't give them the satisfaction,\" \"Don't give them a platform,\" \"They aren't worth it,\" or \"What do you expect from him?\" (one must distinguish between \"expected to\" and \"predicted to\" as these two possess different responsibilities).Alternatively, when discussing a television show, one may say, \"Who even watches it?\"and in",

In short the 11 rules of deontoutilitarianism are: 1) Human Beings have the duty of a) to preserve themselves and b) not attempt to destroy the lives of other human beings 2) Rule 1b does not apply if the human being starts an attack against other innocent beings 3) Rule 1a does not apply under extreme physical suffering 4) In exceptional circumstances, where there is conflict between 1a and 1b, it is possible to violate 1a or 1b. 5) Human beings should have plain reproductive freedom 6) Human beings should not discriminate against other human beings. 7) Human beings should never be cruel against other forms of life in the universe 8) Human beings should always protect life in the universe and never threaten other forms of life, except under certain conditions to be described 9) Human beings should not use other living beings as a food source, unless under certain conditions to be described 10) Research involving animals should always respect the 3R’s (Replace, Reduce, Refine) 11) Every human being has the right to know the truth about subjects affecting their personal lives, except when knowing the truth leads to a direct violation of rule 1. Next I apply these rules to examine the morality or immorality of behaviours such as suicide, euthanasia, animal welfare, stem cell research, selection of embryos, reproduction, population policies, immortality, enhancement, war and peace, lying and telling the truth.",

      "title": "Aqilahh عاقلہ in Islam: Meaning, Necessity and Rules",
      "abstract": "Human being is not perfect by nature so he is also not perfect in his desires and decisions. Human being has a priority in each decision in his favor. In such priorities, human being commits harm and cause loss to others to accomplish the desires and dreams to be true. By doing so, he commits such acts due to intention, negligence or unintentional acts which cause loss to others. Such acts, sometimes, amount to the loss of life of other person. The act done with full consciousness intention and preparation, then it is called Amd in Islamic jurisprudent and Shariah and other acts; done unintentional, are called Khata or Bis-sabab (unintentional act or by reasons of something else). In either cases; intentional or unintentional acts, the loss should be compensated. Islam has formulated such rules derived from the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). In case of loss of life, limb or loss of effective activity of a limb or more (injuries to human body), the Shariah has ordained rules which include Qisas (retribution), Diyat( blood money) and AFW (forgiveness by victim or heirs of victim). These rules are exceptions to general rules and are blessings of Allah (SWT) as mentioned in the Holy Quran that : O ye who believe! The law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty . It is because of the previous nations as Bani Israil (Jews) and Nasara (Christians) were not bestowed such remissions simultaneously in case of offence of injuries and murders. Bani Israil (Jews) were ordered Qisas only but no Diyat or Afw whereas Nasara (Christians) were given permission of Afw only but no Qisas or Diyat. As compared to them Muslims were given three possibilities in case of loss of others so that the enmity and grudge may be settled down between parties amicably or by way of Qisas . These rules have been proved to be a source of stability in the Muslim society. Qisas and Diyat laws introduced in Pakistani legal system and certain amendments were introduced in the penal and procedural laws and rules were framed for the said purpose. The Islamic concept of security to the human being is far lasting and is secured in each and every manner. Concept of Aqilahh is one of those securities provided in Islamic law. The loss of human being should not go vain in any manner whatsoever.",

      "abstract": "Skip Arnold's performances consist of an attempt to become an object, typically by way of a singular action repeated or sustained over a difficult duration. As such, in actions since the early 1980s, he has created bluntly mimetic embodiments of a statue, gargoyle, scarecrow, fountain, or freight. In Marks (1984), Closet Corner (1987), and Hood Ornament (1992), I argue, the categories of the object and the subject vacillate in their distinctness, in such a way that the resulting work of art overtakes or undermines the integrity, or ontological safety, of the body that performs it. In Shoot Me (1992), however, becoming an object raises political questions about the uneven distribution of the right to full subjectivity and the threat or disaster of being turned into an object (for example, a corpse) against one's will. Arnold's performances therefore revel in the difficulties of approaching (or ‘pornotroping’) human subjects as mute or inactive things, and the vital, consequential liveliness of objects in performance.",

      "title": "[Noise and communal dining facilities].",
      "abstract": "Noise is a sound which is unwanted, either because of its effect on humans, its effect on fatigue or multifunctions of physical equipment, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. It is a part of environmental pollution which can, in certain circumstances, reach worrying levels for the population (130 dB cause pain). Unsuitable exposure to noise for even short periods of time is responsible for symptomology involving the hearing organs (hypoacusis) and other parts of the body such as the cardiovascular, muscular and digestive systems via the connection between the central and the autonomous nervous systems. Noise in communal eating areas can be classed as coming from 3 sources: 1) operation of cooking machinery; 2) banging of pans and equipment; 3) voices of both staff and diners. The intensity of noise on these premises varies generally between 60 and 80 dB (discomfort threshold). The Regulations governing this subject are D.Lgs n.277 of 15/8/1991 regarding the protection of employees, D.P.C.M. of 1/3/1991 which establishes the maximum levels of noise both in the home and outside, and the more recent D.P.C.M. of 21/5/1999 referring to noise in public places, which includes restaurants. To contain the exposure to noise in public eating places, we believe that action should be taken at legal levels with stricter limits than the recently passed level of 105 dB, in the building planning departments and also with technological intervention in order to reduce the effects that noise has on the auditive and extra-auditive organs and thus limit possible sublimal messages which certainly do not benefit the psycho-physical well-being of the diners.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest",
      "abstract": "The article considers the peculiarities of the behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest. It is indicated that the following features should be taken into account when studying the typology of victims of violent incest: 1) biological and psychological features and types of victims; 2) circumstances that preceded / contributed to the commission of the violent act; 3) the behavior of the victim at the time of the act of violence and after it. Establishing these features will provide an opportunity to more fully and correctly classify juvenile victims of violent incest. The author points out that in the general sense, the types of juvenile victims of sexual crimes do not differ sharply from the general public. At the same time, the typology of such persons is somewhat narrowed due to the frequent dominance of certain features that provoke the criminal offender to commit an illegal act. For example, if a person seeks to commit theft or robbery / robbery, the victim often plays a secondary role, as circumstances that contribute to the offense come to the fore (dark time of day, absence of outsiders, etc.). In the case of violent incest or any other socially dangerous act of a sexual nature, the language focuses on the victim as the \"object of desire.\" That is why the criminal offender usually pays attention to two aspects: the biological characteristics of the victim and the psychological characteristics (behavioral reactions). A study of statistics and jurisprudence concluded that in most cases this type of criminal offense is committed against juveniles who have an attractive appearance and passive behavior (do not make excessive efforts to protect and prevent incest). Attention is drawn to the fact that the provocation of violent incest is inherent in older minors and is due to the desire to prove to their loved ones their adulthood, sexuality and readiness for sexual intercourse. Often such victims seek to feel wanted, but do not understand the real threat of experiencing illegal sexual influence, especially from a close relative.",

I do not wish to deny that God brings or brought things about (e.g. that the universe continues to exist or that St Paul was converted). So my “God does nothing” has a special sense (it does not deny that action can be ascribed to God). But what I intend in saying it is, I think, something of great importance when it comes to thinking about God in a sensible way. To grasp the point I want to make will save one from following all sorts of false trails when it comes to reflection on divinity. Let’s start with what is going on when you or I act. Examples of human actions could include opening a door, wiping one’s nose, making a telephone call, baking a cake, and waving goodbye to a friend. But what is common to these examples, and to others which might be mentioned? There is at least one thing common. For they all involve people going through a process. I open a door by reaching for the door handle and exerting a continued pressure on it. I wipe my nose by transporting with my hand an object to my nose and moving it about. I bake a cake by walking around a kitchen and following a recipe. I wave good-bye to a friend by lifting my arm and going through a waving motion.",

The first is our competitiveness, which makes us try to master the persons and property of others. The next is our associated lack of trust, which prompts us to anticipate and react to any threatened assaults. The third is our thirst for glory, which leads us to regard with hostility any apparent signs of being undervalued. These propensities render us ‘dissociate’ from one another, as a result of which ‘men have no pleasure, (but on the contrary a great deale of griefe) in keeping company’. Still worse, we are ‘apt to invade, and destroy one another’, whether in the name of making gains or protecting ourselves or upholding our elevated sense of our worth. Cumulatively these invasions give rise to a war ‘of every man, against every man’ in which everyone is equally condemned to live ‘without other security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withall’.",

      "abstract": "Within the last three decades, environmental psychologists, sociologists and psychologists have described \"home\" as a safe haven or sanctuary, in which one experiences positive qualities such as security, privacy, belonging and comfort and develops a healthier sense of self. Problematically though, many individuals do not experience home as such, and as a result may instead feel despair, failure and terror. Yet, despite not experiencing home in the universal way, we all still have a sense of home as an archetypal image. Because a \"sense\" is mentally constructed, and somatically felt, the researcher began to consider the value of an individual accepting \"my body as my home, or my home as my body\". The researcher's intention is to explore how an individual can create a home within the body, specifically within clinical dance/movement therapy. Application potentially applies to several clinical populations such as survivors of body trauma (ie: sexual and physical abuse), those with chronic pain, former eating disorders patients, people who self-mutilate or enact self-harm, recovering drug addicts and alcoholics, the homeless, foster care children, soldiers, and those who have been displaced or are in transition due to job loss. Three adult participants, artists in their own rights, engaged in artistic inquiry through improvisational processes in movement, and in their own respective art modalities, to explore the research question, \"what is your subjective meaning of the metaphor 'body is home'?\". Three themes were crystallized as the final results, and are synthesized into this new definition of \"body as home\": a socio-culturally constructed concept of self, dynamically developed, in an intersubjective process, that supports a holistic and authentic habitation in the body. The significance of these final results, is summarized into four key implications. First, exploring \"body as home\" within a dance/movement therapy clinical context could be an opportunity to construct a healthy attachment relationship due to the inter-personal themes that emerged, and the theory that the mother is a child's initial home. Secondly, the results highlight a potential gap in the definition of \"embodiment\" with regards to inhabiting body with a range of presence and authenticity. Third, they demonstrate that exploration of the metaphor \"body as home\" can directly affect one's body-image. And lastly, the clinical application of \"body as home\" could encourage development of a healthier body-image and more authentic, comfortable embodiment of self in relationship to others and environment.",

It can occur from a fistfight or from punching a hard object. The injury of a “Boxer's Fracture” earned the name from the way in which the injury occurred, punching an immovable object with a closed fist and no boxing mitt (Figure 1). Naturally, a “Boxer” usually punches his fist into his opponent's face or body. An angry person may perform the same action into a person, or into the wall. The third person may be performing a task and strike something with his fist with forceful action accidentally. In any event, if the closed fist “punches” into an immovable or firm object with force, the most frequent injury sustained would be a fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck.

Suicide is a style of death that is the direct or indirect result of a positive or negative Act by the victim. Knowing the act will produce this result (Maris, 1991).

Often the warning had been given to more than one Person (Robins, 1959) about one in Six people committing suicide, Leaves notes (Barrac Lough 1974).",

      "title": "Factual Tests for Identification of Volitional Insanity",
      "abstract": "A. Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive , it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional , it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas. B. The following remarks are confined to the absence of criminal capacity on the volitional level, to which we shall refer in short as “volitional insanity’. This is the case where the person at the time of his act did not have a choice between acting or not acting due to a disease affecting his mind. This case is also referred to as the commission of an act as a result of an irresistible morbid impulse.",

      "abstract": "The article concerns the phenomenon of stalking, or emotional persecution. It also presents legal solutions concerning stalking in the countries where this type of behavior is penalized, and includes a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of criminalization of stalking in Poland. In contrast with the admiration, stalking is a behavior which a victim does not wish. Stalking is an English verb denoting a quiet human or animal tracking in order to capture or kill. In accordance to the definition of an American psychologist J. Reid Meloy, stalking is a form of malicious and repeated harassing and annoying of another person which increases his or her feeling of threat. Stalking, just like domestic violence, and mobbing are classified as so-called \"emotional violence\", by which we understand “interference in the psyche of another person directed against his or her emotions, resulting both immediate and delayed negative effects”. Emotional violence is never a single event. Stalking most often exhibits in such behaviors as: calls, silent calls, night calls, wandering in the vicinity of victim's home, making contact through a third party, questioning about the victim in his or her surroundings, persisting at the door / home / work, sending letters, e-mails, text messages, and gifts, placing postal orders in victim's name, tracking and following the victim, slander (distributing false information and rumors), burglary to victims house or car, stealing victim's belongings, harassing victim's family and friends, as well as attacking and assaulting them. The main problem with providing an adequate legal protection to a victim of a stalker lies in the fact that some of these behaviors are criminal, and some are not prohibited by law, nevertheless if repeated, they carry severe consequences for the victim which cannot be counteracted by means of criminal law. The tragedy of stalking victims lies in the fact that a persecutor may intimidate his victims and force them to change habits and plans, to live in constant fear. Stalker often causes huge mental suffering through actions which, under Polish law, are legally indifferent. What is also important is that actions of a stalker do not have to result from his or her wrongful intentions or desire to annoy the victim (in many law systems malicious intention of the stalker is a sine qua non for criminalization of stalking). Sometimes the persecutor acts with good intentions (the desire to win the love of a loved one), nevertheless behavior of the stalker is frightening for the victim. Results of a study taken to estimate the scale of stalking differ between countries where such studies have been conducted. This discrepancy is probably influenced by the definition assumed by researchers, research methodology, sample size and selection, but also by the different temperament of the inhabitants of these countries.",

      "abstract": "A man and his community have long been endangered by various perils threatening to destroy or harm them, jeopardize their life, health or property, questioning even their survival. Various forms of protection being applied had to continuously be improved since there also emerged new hazards or risks. Except for the need to protect their own property from natural disasters or from other people's actions, there appeared the need for protection from the consequences of one's own actions as well, which could cause a damage to other people, but to his/her own goods too. The initial forms of a protection of people affected by the accident (the illness or death of the breadwinner, the emergence of disability, the destruction of property after fire and the like) were the common contributions and the help of the community - a family, village or tribe. In a primitive society, when there was no private property, this problem could not be complex: the destroyed goods were replaced by the newly created ones among the community. In these more or less poorly regulated undertakings can be found certain traces of a modern insurance. The root word of the term insurance is the adjective safe (sicuro in Italian, secures in Latin). An individual's own forces could not provide such a protection. Therefore, very early, during the development of the human society, there arose the idea on the organization of the necessary protection through a mechanism used by the individuals threatened by the same danger. In such a way, those individuals could, through their natural or, later, cash contributions, provide a compensation to those affected by the risk.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nonsuicidal self‐injury (NSSI) refers to the deliberate destruction of one's own body tissue without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially sanctioned. Although terms such as self‐mutilation and deliberate self‐harm have also been used for this behavior, NSSI has increasingly become the term of choice. Common examples of NSSI include skin‐cutting, burning, scratching, needle‐sticking, rubbing against rough surfaces, hitting or banging body parts, and interfering with wound healing. In general, behaviors associated with eating disorders (e.g., binging or purging) and substance disorders (e.g., alcohol or drug use) are not considered NSSI, because they are not accompanied by specific intent to physically damage one's body tissue. Similarly, most cases of tattooing and body piercing are not considered NSSI, because they are socially sanctioned forms of body decoration or artistic expression. Importantly, NSSI can be distinguished from suicidal behavior. Unlike suicide attempts, NSSI is not performed with the intent to die, and the injuries caused by NSSI are rarely life‐threatening or medically severe (Klonksy &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2007).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chapter 3 focuses on the lengths to which people go to avoid seeing themselves, or being seen by others, as evil. This is rooted in people’s hard-wired need to belong: Just as murderous Cain was “marked” and banished by God in the ancient Hebrew story, being labeled an “evildoer” is the ultimate signifier of social exclusion. Thus, denial of one’s role (e.g., motivated forgetting), minimization of harm or intentionality (e.g., automatism, dissociation), and offering “good” (e.g., a moral mandate) or “good enough” (e.g., revenge) justifications for one’s behavior can all be used to deflect the label. Alternatively, people may try to neutralize the label by pointing to their moral credentials prior to the incident in question (moral licensing), insisting that they are no worse than those who judge them (a form of normalization), or declaring that they are immune to others’ judgments (asserting interpersonal power).",

This command is very rational, because excessive behavior in any condition always brings harm, both to the perpetrator and especially to the people around who are affected by this attitude. Because excessive means exceeding the limits of tolerance or normal conditions that must be maintained. Although excessive size is relative, what is certain is that an act will be categorized as excessive if it sacrifices fundamental things, principal, primary, for something secondary, let alone tertiary. On the other hand, balance will bring benefits and goodness. In the fiqh proposal the act of \"taking benefits and rejecting harm\" is called maslahah (jalbu al-manfa'ah wa daf'i madarrah). This is in line with the general objective of the Shari'ah, namely realizing the benefit of human life (litahqiq masalih al-'ibad). However, a moderation that makes maslahah an ideal goal and concept requires dialectics and common ground so that it can be realized in the life of modern society, especially in the context of the nation-state.",

Drought is meant to serve as a punishment to people for their wrongdoings. As far as people engage in doing wrongs, God may reprimand them in one way or the other for precautions. The paper is meant to serve as a reminder to desist from doing wrong. It discusses thirteen habits or instances or wrongs that bring about drought that are all human makings. Some problems were caused by the people themselves besides the ones that God sent down to his creatures.“God never changes for people unless they change for themselves (Innaallaha laa yughayyiru maa bi qaumin hatta yughayyiru maa bi anfusihim, (Quran: chapter 76, Verse 21).

The paper supports the Hausa saying “In kunne ya jiya jiki ya tsira” and “Tuntuɓe mai gyaran tafiya” The paper looks at the importance of rain water to human and animals’ lives and, at the same time lists problems that cause drought.

This in turn may be of two types: love of possession (or of a thing), and love of communion (or of a person). By its very nature, the love of a thing is directed to the love of a person, and when this order is upset, certain aberrations make their appearance: either things are loved as if they were persons, or persons as if they were things, or finally persons are loved as persons but without wishing to do anything for them.\r\nThe three requirements for love are: good, likeness, and knowledge. The Good refers to the object of love, which is always some good, either a substance (person) or an adjective (thing). Likeness refers to the subject of love, and is either perfect (person) or imperfect (thing). Knowledge has to do with the relation subject-object, because nothing is loved if it is not first known.\r\nThe four principal effects of love are: union, mutual indwelling, extasis and zeal. Union, to a certain extent anterior to love, is also an effect of love, and the union is real to the extent to which it is possible: «two lovers wish to become one». The mutual indwelling is that by which the lover is in the loved one by knowledge and by desire and in the same way the loved one in the lover, so that each one can say: «I live, rather it is not I, but the other that lives in me». Extasis, or going outside oneself, is due to the fact that the lover is outside himself and lives in the loved one. And finally, zeal is a movement in defence of love, by which everything that threatens love is rejected.\r\nHuman love in the strict sense is the love between man and woman, and is a mixture of the love of a person and the love of a thing, because it refers not only to the souls but also to the bodies, and presupposes the characteristic of exclusiveness that is typical of the love of a thing. But it is also the love of a person and implies by its nature a constancy or endurance until death.",

      "title": "Children's Moral Relationships with Nature.",
      "abstract": "Two studies of the development of children's moral relationships with nature addressed such questions as: (1) What does it mean to say that we have an obligation not to harm the natural environment? (2) Does the natural environment feel pain? (3) Does it have rights? or (4) Is moral obligation an inappropriate construct by which to understand the poral relation of humans with nature? In one study, 60 children in grades 2, 5, and 8 were interviewed about the Prince William Sound Oil Spill. In a second study, 72 children in grades 1, 3, and 5 in an impoverished inner-city black community were interviewed on their conceptions of and values about nature. The preliminary findings from these studies provide evidence for several overarching ways in which children reason about the natural environment: (1) homocentric reasoning, in which an appeal is made to the child's understanding of how the action of one person or ;roup harms the physical welfare of others, or infringes on others' rights: the natural environment acts as an intermediary; (2) intrinsic values and rights reasoning, which highlights the idea that the natural environment has a moral standing at least partly independent of its value as a human commodity; (3) relational reasoning, which consists of framing the relationship with animals in a homocentric way such that animals serve human psychological needs; and (4) conceptions of harmony with nature that follow syllogistic reasoning. The findings build on children's obligatory and discretionary moral judgments and respond to two different questions on moral theory: What does morally right action consist of? and, What does it mean to be a morally good person?

Rājavoramunī remarks kāmesumicchācāra is demanded to directly and indirectly avoid and forbidden in the five precepts, the eight precepts, and the ten precepts. Remarkably, kāmesumicchācāra acts in Buddhism are compared to the acts of a hungry dog, a hungry vultures, burns by mal-carrying a blazing grass torch, a burning pit, a speedily faded dream, a show-off vanity, a fruit tree risky to be climbed and cut by rogues, a risky meat chopping block, a painful wound pierced by spear or a lance and an endangering snakehead.  In this article, the author shall trail through the Principia of ‘genital malfeasances (kāmesumicchācāra)’ with its criteria of violation while inevitably discussing the dilemmas within Buddhist ethics on its avoidances and some alternative perspectives about genital malfeasances (kāmesumicchācāra) through the lenses of some leading scholars.",

So beyond the negative duties of justice, there are the positive duties of charity. We can't remain content simply to avoid undermining the other's personality but should do everything possible to help him realize and develop it. To the formula of the moral law that sums up justice in the phrase “Don't do to others what you wouldn't want done to you” must be added the formula of charity: “Do unto others as you would have done to you.” In other words, don't rest content with seeing to it that your own personality remains intact.

      "title": "Self-harm and suicide",
      "abstract": "A person may redress a wrong by harming the transgressor, or by harming someone with whom the transgressor has a vital CS relationship. Suicide and self-harm take both forms, sometimes simultaneously. Thus, Annie may kill herself because she has violated a relationship that only her self-punishment can redeem, or she may kill herself to punish Bill who has transgressed against her, but who loves her and will suffer when she kills herself. In either case there are often important metarelational motives at work. Hurting or killing oneself may restore the collective honor of one’s primary CS group, such as family or military unit. Suicide and self-harm may also show that one accepts full individual responsibility for failure, so third parties should not blame anyone else. In other metarelational processes, Annie’s suicide to punish Bill’s transgression against Annie may make George, who loves Annie, hate Bill, or at the very least shame Bill by drawing George’s and others’ attention to the gravity of Bill’s transgression against Annie. Similarly, like Lucretia’s suicide after being raped by Sextus, it may spur others to avenge a grave transgression. More recently, Tibetan monks’ suicide by setting themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule over Tibet and repression of Buddhism have put great moral pressure on China, and in 2010 Mohammed Bouazizi’s suicide by fire in Tunisia brought out masses of protestors who overthrew the government.",

On the tables the human life is indicated by verious activities, and the author classifys them into five categories; i) body care or hygiene, like sleeping and eating, activities which cannot be done by others, ii) activities which can be performed for others, and so socially exchangeable, for instance, cooking, sewing, washing and labours generally, iii) activities with a gathering of people and things, for instance seeing drama, hearing concert, or buying goods in shops and seeing display in a museum and so on, iv) about storage of varieties of things, v) passing in buildings. The four categories of human activities i)〜iv) apt to make special room types for the sake of 'man hours' (the multiplication of number of men who use the room by hours which the room is used). For instance 1) sleeping room (eight hours every day by one or two persons), 2) auditorium (a few hours by mass of people), 3) working room and office (after the industrial revolution), 4) store room (for goods) and so on. Table 1, Show how the forty two room types have differentiated in modern community (in this table 21 building types are shown). The author notices that the passage and structural system are the tools which make the formation of rooms. On the otherhand the set of differentiated building types correspond to modern demoratic community life.",

      "title": "Human Primitive Behavior",
      "abstract": "In dangerous, strenuous, or life-threatening situations, some behavioral patterns may occur that do not belong to the \"normal\" spectrum of human behavior. Among these are what is referred to here as \" sedimentation\" (which may result in the finding of a feeble person or a deceased in topographically low-lying sections of buildings), as well as the phenomena of hiding and covering and undressing (a well-known phenomenon related to fatal hypothermia), and other behavioral elements of minor relevance like confusion, fumbling, and screaming. These behavioral peculiarities may lead to dubious findings at a death scene and may be mistaken for signs of a preceding crime by the unwary. Sometimes, circumstantial findings seem to indicate that a fight or a violent or sexual offense took place. However, a more thorough analysis of the scene often shows that the whole situation had been created by the deceased himself or herself prior to death without any third-party involvement. The aforementioned behavioral elements are termed \" primitive\" here because at least some of them, like covering and hiding, seem to originate from early developmental stages of human instinctive behavior as a reaction pattern in response to danger and stress that also can be observed in animals. These behavioral patterns have their origin in phylogenetically old, autonomous parts of the brain. A good knowledge of the elements and patterns of human primitive behavior and the associated ways of acting is most helpful to all those involved in the death investigation because it often helps in the correct interpretation of curious death scene scenarios that otherwise would remain obscure or even enigmatic. Also, search and rescue teams will benefit from taking these behavioral patterns into consideration because they enable the development of improved search strategies for seeking missing persons.",

      "abstract": "Since centuries ago or even more, the hula hoop has been practiced by people to keep their good health while having fun. Curiously, this simple toy made by a plastic ring, also previously made by a circle of willow, rattan, grapevines or stiff grasses, is subjected to several high and complex physical laws that make, at the same time, possible its beautiful movements. Physical laws are opposing and/or accompanying the movement of the circle-hoop-ring, such as gravity, centripetal force, friction, speed or velocity, and acceleration, in a torque or tendency to rotate. Specific muscles of the body are activated during hula hoop dancing and a general cardio exercise is happening. On the other hand, a stimulation of creativity is also occurring to make a mathematically reasonable and beautiful flow of movements for the own enjoyment or to make a performance for other people’s enjoyment. Then, the dancer with a hoop is moving the ring around several parts of his/her body (waist, core, shoulders, neck, arms), also rolling it over the body like a wheel, making waves in different axis, tossing it to the air or floor, etc. and dancer can jump him/herself through the hoop, or stealing its movements with his/her body. While motor learning happens, specific areas of the brain are activated differently during trials of learning. Then flow and fluid movements become automatic in an asymmetrical way considering our hand preference. However, for getting all this benefits, it is required a controlled practice in children and adults, that means a smooth and not violent, reasonable and measured practice in time and intensity and not negligent or irresponsible. Otherwise, some lesions have been described in literature.",

Risk is generally defined as the potential for an unwanted negative consequence or event. The term indoor environment, as used encompasses all enclosed spaces occupied by humans, including home, work, shopping, education, entertainment, and transportation. Humans have always estimated the risks of their actions or inactions in making personal decisions.

      "title": "Dead Sorrow: A Story About Loss and a New Theory of Wrongful Death Damages",
      "abstract": "In this “scholarative,” combining personal narrative and traditional doctrinal scholarship, the author uses a story about personal loss to argue for a new type of wrongful death damages.When a tortiously caused death occurs, five losses/injuries result: (1) the decedent’s life itself; (2) the trauma and bereavement suffered by the decedent’s survivors, collectively referred to in this article as “grief;” (3) the pecuniary value of financial and service contributions that the decedent could have been expected to make to his or her dependents; (4) the loss of the decedent’s society and companionship, which in some states is considered a type of pecuniary loss under the fiction that society and companionship are a type of “lost service” with ascertainable monetary value (technically placing such damages in category 3) but which in other states is viewed as an intangible or noneconomic loss; and (5) the direct costs associated with the death, such as funeral expenses.The wrongful death system fails to account for the first two elements. Current law attaches no monetary value to life itself. The second item, grief, traditionally has been the invisible injury from wrongful death. This article proposes a legislative reconceptualization of wrongful death damages that addresses both of the deficiencies described above — for one price. Specifically, it argues that life has independent value apart from what we earn and give to others and that this value should be recognized in the form of “lost life” damages.Departing from the orthodox view that such damages should be allocated to the decedent’s estate or to the survivors, the article instead suggests that damages for the lost value of life be used for the exclusive purpose of establishing a lasting memorial to the decedent. Such a solution would promote both the economic deterrence and corrective justice models of tort law. Additionally, the memorial established with the lost life damages would, at no additional cost, provide a proven grief-healing instrument for all persons who mourn the decedent’s passing. Finally, because it is recommended that memorials created with lost life damages be required to serve a utilitarian function, another unique aspect of the proposal is that it would allocate tort damages in ways that benefit society in addition to tort victims, enhancing the net social benefit of the tort system.",

Most environ? mental ethicists strongly believe that such a destructive act would clearly be morally wrong. Yet its wrongness cannot be attrib? uted either to any instrumental disvalue of the destructive action or to any instrumen? tal value of the destroyed entity, for no sen? tient beings will ever suffer from that particular action or type of action, and nor will any sentient being ever suffer as a re? sult of the loss of the entity whose destruc? tion is being considered.

      "abstract": "BY THE EARLY SECOND CENTURY A.D., the Roman jurists were invoking the term imperitia, lack of skill or experience, as a basis for the legal responsibility of skilled individuals who damaged another's property in the course of their work. The term is invoked in a broad range of situations and doubtless was applicable in innumerable others of similar type. For example, you entrust a gem to a jeweler to be set. It breaks in the process. A doctor, hired to perform surgery, further harms the patient. You give a cup to an artisan to be carved. The cup shatters. 1 All of these examples, taken from the Digest, presuppose a similar situation: A person is employed to do a job and is entrusted with the material necessary for the completion of the work, usually a moveable object, a slave, or an animal. In the course of the work, this material, whether inanimate or animate, sustains damage. Who should be responsible and on what grounds? A series of texts preserved in the Digest illustrates how, over the course of the classical period of Roman jurisprudence, the jurists articulated and interpreted imperitia as a key concept for use in legal disputes dealing with a broad range of individuals employed in the workforce of the empire. As increased scholarly attention is devoted to the study of the Roman working population from a legal perspective, an examination of imperitia will shed light on one of the principal substantive tools developed to regulate artisans and skilled workers of all kinds. 2 The surviving Digest texts permit the reconstruction of key elements of the [End Page 107] jurists' conception of the employment relationship as it was encompassed in the contract of locatio conductio operis, the contract of lease and hire of a job. 3 The question of the worker's responsibility for skilled work is a central element of the law with regard to this contract. I will argue that the jurists' development of imperitia as a legal doctrine was the product of a complex relationship between law and its social and economic context. 4 This process of legal development reveals a great deal about the methods the jurists employed in dealing with certain segments of the Roman workforce. It emerges with relative clarity from the texts that the jurists presume that these contracts are designed for the hire of workers who are capable of assuming a considerable degree of risk for the skilled execution of their work as an implied feature of the contract. But the jurists never state clearly what standard should be used to evaluate the worker's performance. Analysis of the evidence shows that the jurists tend to favor a method of evaluation that focuses on the quality of the performance based upon external, objective criteria, rather than the individualized fault of the worker. 5 From this reconstruction of how the law functioned, one can speculate about what the advantages of this regime were from the jurists' point of view and how adequately or inadequately jurists' law functioned with regard to the diversity of workers known to have existed in the workforce of the empire. The results of this investigation have implications for our understanding of the activities of skilled and craft workers, especially in the city of Rome. The inhabitants of cities in the empire became increasingly accustomed to the availability of a wide variety of goods and services and in all likelihood purchased them or contracted for them from individuals with whom they had no other connections, that is, the workers themselves or merchants or traders. 6 The legal regime described here presupposes the existence of a multiplicity of such workers whose concerns penetrated [End Page 108] the legal system, who came to the attention of the Roman jurists, and who were, apparently, able to maneuver to some extent within the legal system. 7 The concept of imperitia originated as the jurists developed...",

      "title": "The Ethics of Co-operation in Wrongdoing",
      "abstract": "There are a number of ways in which a person can share the guilt of another's wrongdoing. He might advise it, command it or consent to it. He might provoke it, praise it, flatter the wrongdoer, or conceal the wrong. He might stay silent when there is a clear duty to denounce the wrong or its perpetrator; or he might positively defend the wrong done. Finally, he might actively participate or co-operate in the wrongdoing. These various activities, apart from co-operation, typically occur before or after the commission of the wrong itself, only provocation being essentially before the fact. As such they fall into the categories of seduction or comfort, seduction being essentially pre-commission and comfort post-commission. In seduction (mutatis mutandis for comfort), the seducer typically leads another into doing wrong who has not definitely made up his mind. He does not assist in the commission, but he leads to its occurring. If the principal (as I will call the one who commits the wrong) has made up his mind, actions which might otherwise amount to seduction are best characterized as amounting to scandal, since they do not lead to wrong but reinforce the principal in his wrongful intent or provide to third parties a bad example since they connote approval of the principal's action. Closely related to the concept of seduction is that of solicitation, though perhaps these are best thought of as two aspects of the same kind of activity.",

      "title": "Forms of Mental Contamination",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mental contamination that develops after experiencing a psychological or physical violation (e.g., sexual assault) has the following characteristics. The person feels a sense of internal dirtiness, beneath the skin, not localized, evoked, or intensified by images, memories, or thoughts about the violation and/or the violator. The violator is the central, most intense contaminant. The basis of the contamination is obscure and perplexing because it is not obviously linked to common sources of dirtiness, and the human origin of the disorder is not recognized. The feelings of contamination are unique to the affected person. Objects and people can appear to be clean but feel dirty. Washing, even compulsively, is ineffective and it is difficult ever to feel completely clean. Usually there is a moral element in mental contamination.",

      "title": "Sticks, carrots, or a hybrid mechanism: The test case of refusal to divorce",
      "abstract": "Abstract Various incentives may be used in order to cause a person to desist from creating negative externalities. Both carrots and sticks have advantages and disadvantages. Literature is familiar with various combinations between them. In most cases, the mechanism is “horizontal”: using carrots with respect to certain parts of the population, and sticks against others. The article presents a novel, vertical mechanism, in the form of a “game” played in two consecutive stages that trap the damager within the mechanism. At the center of the first stage of the mechanism stands a “carrot,” which is money offered for the damager in order for him/her to desist from the evil, combined with a type of a stick, which is a social sanction (shaming). At the center of the second stage, which is activated only if the first stage did not succeed, stands a “stick,” which is a civil action that can be brought against the damager if s/he does not take the carrot offered to him/her in the first stage. The objective: to incentivize a person to engage in fruitful negotiations to end harmful activity at the pre-mechanism stage. To illustrate this, the article draws on negative social behavior of one-sided refusal to give/accept the divorce bill (get) in the Jewish sector the world over. The mechanism will be built primarily on the basis of a few law and economics theories. A dialogue will thus be created with these theories in fields where they are rarely applied. The main argument is that the use of a vertical setup increases efficiency at a minimal additional cost, overcomes a moral problem, and optimally combines the resulting advantages by deploying sticks and carrots, and at the same time neutralizes most of the disadvantages of either of them.",

      "abstract": "Self-defense and its close relative, defense of others, are uses of force against another person — Attacker — for the purpose of preventing Attacker from harming another’s person or property. These uses of force are called self-defense (SD) when employed by the one whose person or property is threatened (the Victim, or V); they are called defense of others (DO) when employed by a non-threatened third party who is not in V’s family (TP).SD and DO are preemptive uses of force because they occur before the acts they are intended to prevent occur. They thus belong to the family of preemptive measures that harm people or restrict their liberty in order to prevent them from harming others in the future. Examples of preemptive measures other than SD and DO include preventive detention, restraining orders, gun control laws, and similar laws making possession of certain items illegal for fear of their misuse.Because SD and DO are preemptive, they operate in the realm of epistemic uncertainty. V and TP can never be certain the feared acts will occur. They can never be certain that if the acts occur, what their consequences will be. They can never be certain what alternative to SD and DO for averting the feared harms exist. And they can never be certain what the status of the presumed Attacker is — that is, whether the presumed Attacker is culpable or nonculpable. I will have had a lot more to say about these epistemic points in due course.",

And it is not uncommon for such people to argue against the destruction of human embryos by invoking the claim that the destruction of human embryos is morally on par with killing the following humans: (A) the standard infant, (B) the suicidal teenager, (C) the temporarily comatose individual, and (D) the standard adult. I argue here that this claim is false and do so as follows. First, I provide an account of the prima facie wrongness of killing individuals (A) – (D). Briefly, I contend that individuals (A) – (D) have a certain property in common, that of having a future of value. An individual who has a future of value has the potential to (i) value goods of consciousness when he will (or would) experience them and (ii) do so as a psychologically continuous individual.",

Among serious offenders, self-justification in terms of having no choice is more common or the hapless claim that \"I don't know why I did that\" or even \"I can't believe I did that\" (which all too often becomes \"I can't remember doing that\" for as Nietzche (1886) wrote \"I have done that—says my memory. I could not have done that—says my pride and remains inexorable. Eventually memory gives in\"). Those who do appeal to principle to justify their evil actions almost inevitably cite value systems that have considerable, if not universal, acceptance. I have encountered men who proudly declared their killings to be part of the pursuit of righteous aims, such as protecting children from pedophiles, stopping the killing of the unborn child, reducing AIDS, and cleansing their city of vice. Interestingly the combination of dreadful, and in many cases repeated, violence with self-righteous superiority often attracts from fellow prisoners and prison staff a label of evil.",

It has its own linguistic status and its own lexical base (lexis of destruction). This category and its lexical stock occupy a significant place in the general classification of lexemes of the Russian and Serbian languages. The terms ?destruction? and ?destructiveness? almost always refer to negative, destructive actions, processes or phenomena. The main characteristics of destruction in the broadest sense include: change, deformation, disintegration of something; structural changes under the impact of various forces (physical, mechanical, spontaneous) or humans. The result of destruction is usually the destruction of something (partial or complete). The semantic field of destructiveness contains verbs at its core, and the peripheral part consists of nouns, adjectives, adverbs and other terminological vocabulary with destructive semantics. The central unit of such a verb-centric field is the verb destroy, which forms the semantic basis of many other lexemes in this category.",

      "title": "A CLINICAL STUDY OF GILLES DE LA TOURETTE'S DISEASE (MALADIE DES TICS) IN CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "In his search of the literature for cases of a similar nature, Gilles de la Tourette was much impressed by reports of analogous syndromes in other cultures: \"latah,\" \"myriachit\" and \"jumping\"(13). \"The term latah conveys to the Malays a curious behavioral quirk, or aberration, normal, and yet not quite so.\"(14). The latah reaction consists of a severe startle reaction, imitative behavior, automatic obedience, and coprolalia. The victim is compelled \"against his will\"(15) to imitate the speech and behavior of others and to obey their commands, even though his tormentors clearly intend to degrade and ridicule him. He may even injure himself in the compulsion to mimic a self-destructive gesture only partially demonstrated by the person who \"teases\" him. For example, if the tormentor makes a sudden movement as if to place his hand in a fire, the latah victim may burn his own hand(16). \"Myriachit\" is the transliteration of a Russian word for an identical syndrome, one of a group classified as \"arctic hysteria\"(14, 16). The \"Jumpers\" of Maine, also known as \"Shakers\" or \"Barkers,\" were members of a deviant Methodist sect who practiced celibacy and communal living after their migration to New England(14). Church ceremonials reached a climax of religious ecstasy at which the members of the congregation would jump, shake, roll on the floor, or crawl about on all fours, all the while barking and emitting incoherent sounds (speaking in tongues). Those who participated in these ceremonials became prey to this behavior outside the church services. Members of this sect, examined by Beard in 1880(17), exhibited violent jumping and twisting movements when startled, echolalia, and echokinesis. Beard stated: \"All the Jumpers agree that it tires them to be jumped and they dread it, but they were constantly annoyed by their companions.\" It has been traditional in much of the medical literature to treat maladie des tics as though it were identical with latah and its cognate disorders. This is almost certainly incorrect. Tics, the earliest and often the most striking manifestations of Gilles de la Tourette's disease, are unknown in latah, whereas the imitation phenomena, which are the core of latah reactions, are often totally lacking in maladie des tics. The coprolalia in latah always follows provocation and is never perseverative. Latah reactions (with the significant exception of \"jumping\") are far more common in females, maladie des tics in males. Latah is never seen earlier than late adolescence. Sudden fright is consistently cited as its precipitating cause; startle reactions are prominent. When Aberle brought 3 persons familiar with latah reactions to see case #1 of this paper, they were unanimous in concluding that maladie des tics was clearly not the same as latah(16). Yap has suggested that latah reactions are a variant of traumatic or fear neurosis to be found in cultures with limited control over the physical environment(14). The etiology of Gilles de la Tourette's disease(2, 18-20) remains as obscure as it was in his time, though we may dismiss the notion of degeneracy, the catchall so fashionable in his day(1). Tics may be found in post-encephalitic conditions(21). They may accompany chorea, which may or may not be rheumatic in origin(22). They may be the symbolic crystallization of psychologic disturbances(23). Even when psychogenically induced, they may prove extremely refractory to psychotherapy(24, 25). Contrariwise, the organically grounded tic may be diminished, if not obliterated, by reduction in emotional tension. Consequently, arguments that reason from clinical phenomenology to hypotheses of origin must inevitably be inconclusive. The clinical manifestations of maladie des tics are responsive to the social environment, as our cases demonstrate; yet this in no sense constitutes proof of psychogenesis. An organic substratum may be nonetheless subject to modification or control by psychologic influences, since mental phenomena are brain events with electrical fields(26). In this connection, it is instructive to recall Efron's demonstration, in a patient with uncinate fits, that the mere recollection of odors and a conditioned visual image sufficed to inhibit the fits(27). In our experience, pharmacologic therapy, including sedatives, muscle relaxants, and tranquilizers, has been ineffective. At this stage of our knowledge, it would appear justified to continue efforts at psychotherapeutic management, despite Heuscher's admonition that the tic phenomena are defenses against an impending psychosis(20), and Mahler and Luke's warning that the release of aggressive and erotic material may \"weaken the controlling powers of the child ticquer\"(10). Very few of the cases reported in the literature have had a thorough trial of intensive psychologic treatment, still fewer in the early course of their disorder. At the least, psychotherapy may be of assistance to child and family in dealing with the social consequences of the illness. More hopefully, it may succeed in modifying the intrapsychic tensions that aggravate, if they do not cause, the symptoms. Several of our patients gave evidence of symptomatic improvement associated with psychologic treatment. The one patient with an apparently total recovery had the benefit of capably administered psychotherapy at two important junctures in his life. He had parents who, after psychiatric guidance, devoted their total efforts to his recovery. They were inclined to ascribe great value to home management with its concomitant descrease in social stimulation to the patient. It is not possible to say whether these factors or still other influences were instrumental in his recovery. Nonetheless, his gratifying response supports the wisdom of attempting total psychiatric management for patients with Gilles de la Tourette's disease.",

Postulates of national identity can take the form of imperatives like „Love your motherland!” Very often they are formulated in another way that replaces the imperative with allegations expressed by claims in first person (single or plural) or in impersonal form. Such statements are similar and operate as spells. The ambivalent attitude to the ‘own’ contains some negative elements. Their designation may indicate a trauma, frustration caused by some kind of insufficiency (including a lack of heroic deeds), inferiority complex. Trauma and shame can be pushed to the unconscious, but can also be productive as a cohesive element and as search for compensatory actions or verbal structures.",

With these behaviors of people, it is seen that they do not take these actions out of legal obligation, but act and should act with the consciousness and conscience of the civilized man. People who do this are driven by the need for cooperation, humanity, existence at the expense of the other, namely society. A person performs this action by perpetrating the work of another without consent for any other person. Hence, they undertake some factual and legal action for the other, sacrificing something that can be the property value and their bodily integrity. Sometimes this action must be taken because there are actions that cannot be postponed, therefore someone should take an action in such situations even when uninvited. Consequently, the subject matter analyzed in this paper is the act of perpetration of the work of another without consent as a source of the right of obligations in the Republic of Kosovo.&#x0D; &#x0D; Received: 6 October 2021 / Accepted: 1 November 2021 / Published: 5 November 2021",

      "title": "Do toddlers reason about other people’s experiences of objects? A limit to early mental state reasoning",
      "abstract": "Human social life requires an understanding of the mental states of one’s social partners. Two people who look at the same objects often experience them differently, as a twinkling light or a planet, a 6 or a 9, and a random cat or Cleo, their pet. Indeed, a primary purpose of communication is to share distinctive experiences of objects or events. Here, we test whether toddlers (14-15 months) are sensitive to another agent’s distinctive experiences of pictures when determining the goal underlying the agent’s actions in a minimally social context. Across seven experiments (n = 206), toddlers viewed either videotaped or live events in which an actor, whose perspective differed from their own, reached (i) for pictures of human faces that were upright or inverted or (ii) for pictures that depicted a rabbit or a duck at different orientations. Then either the actor or the toddler moved to a new location that aligned their perspectives, and the actor alternately reached to each of the two pictures. By comparing toddlers’ looking to the latter reaches, we tested whether their goal attributions accorded with the actor’s experience of the pictures, with their own experience of the pictures, or with no consistency. In no experiment did toddlers encode the actor’s goal in accord with his experiences of the pictures. In contrast, in a similar experiment that manipulated the visibility of a picture rather than the experience that it elicited, toddlers (n = 32) correctly expected the actor’s action to depend on what was visible and occluded to him, rather than to themselves. In a verbal version of the tasks, older children (n = 35) correctly inferred the actor’s goal in both cases. These findings provide further evidence for a dissociation between two kinds of mental state reasoning: When toddlers view an actor’s object-directed action under minimally social conditions, they take account of the actor’s visual access to the object but not the actor’s distinctive experience of the object.",

      "abstract": "It is emphasized, that by known reliable news it is appropriate to understand those, that fully correspond to the actual circumstances of the action (actions or inactions of an individual or a small group of people), events (actions or inactions of very large groups of people, when it is impossible to establish the role in achieving the overall result of each of participants, for example, in the course of the war, etc.) or phenomenon (action or inaction of the forces of nature, including predatory animals, that are in conditions not regulated by humans) in general or a certain part of it, and peculiarities of perception, memorization, their storage, reproduction and other transmissions by a certain person, including life experience or relevant special or professional competence contribute to the transmission or other disclosure of practically adequate news. Attention is focused on the fact, that according to the basic orientation of the result of their public disclosure, each of the named types of news can be divided into those, that condition their perception by the majority of addressees as positive, negative and positive-negative, and negative information – also as neutral, socially harmful and socially dangerous news, when the last two types of news, depending on the level of public danger as a result of their public disclosure, may create conditions for the recipients to commit relevant criminal and other offences. On the basis of the above, it is proposed to improve the constitutional foundations of the legitimate implementation of any type of juridical, journalistic and other mass media proving or public discussion in terms of the freedom of not just any, but only knowingly reliable speech, as well as specified circumstances under which publication may be limited and knowingly reliable news.",

      "abstract": "In this book, Michael Plaxton advocates for expansion of the legal definition of ''sexual consent'' to include ''implied consent.'' 1 Like Don Stuart 2 and Edward Greenspan, 3 he is troubled by the effects of the legal definition of sexual consent, in particular, by its potential to deem what Plaxton characterizes as ''innocent'' or ''morally'' non-culpable physical contact between intimates as ''criminal''-a result Plaxton describes as ''counter-intuitive.''Examples offered of ''innocent,'' albeit non-consensual (no contemporaneous agreement) and therefore ''criminal'' conduct, include touching the other party in public (caressing her knee under a restaurant table) or private (the impromptu surprise ''embrace'' or the kiss while she sleeps).These examples, Plaxton suggests, show that ordinary acts of intimacy between parties in accordance with normative arrangements and practices established by them are not criminal acts and should not to be labelled as ''crimes.'' 4 Plaxton therefore proposes that the definition of ''sexual consent'' as ''voluntary agreement to participate in the sexual activity in question,'' as codified by Parliament in 1992 and first construed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v Ewanchuk in 1999, be amended to recognize a role for ''implied consent.'' 5He expressly limits his focus to sexual activity between heterosexual individuals and presumes the male to be the socially dominant party, the female the ''consenting'' party and the potential complainant.Economic equality is assumed, and issues arising from intersectionality are not addressed.Plaxton claims that recognition of the validity of ''implied consent'' would advance the equality rights of women by affording them a fuller measure of sexual autonomy free from the state enacted and judicially CJWL/RFD",

It means happening by chance, not planned rather incidental e.g., a casual encounter, a casual meeting, a casual visit etc. It is made or done without much care or thought viz., a casual remark, a casual invitation. Thus, the term casual is widely used. In derogatory sense it signifies irresponsibility showing too little concern and interest as well. For example, the company’s casual attitude to office security invites danger. It stands for not careful or thorough i.e., not serious eg., a casual inspection, a casual glance at a book, a casual observer. In case of clothes, a casual short-sleeved shirt is an example of casual wear which is simply an informal dress. Similarly, in the market shoes are displayed with the message :a pair of man’s casuals. Shoes, clothes, etc. designed for informal occasions do not obey dress conduct.Thus, casual wear means relaxation. It disobeys or rebels against the so-called conduct. Here, men and women enjoys free style which differs from so-called smart wear.",

Complaints that human beings are capable of expressing are not so many, there are only a handful, and this work intends to be exhaustive in its exposition. It is possible to complain against third persons. It is also possible to do so against oneself assuming either the intransigent attitude of a father who judges a son who does not fulfill his expectancies, or as a son who resents the paternal demands which he feels he cannot comply. Other kind of complaints include physical symptoms, either isolated (cephalea, dysnea, urticaria) or constituting syndromes or illnesses. Losses suffered are also a source of complaints, whatever the lost object might be (person, situation, material things or a part of oneself). It can be mourned because of its absence, or else by feeling guilty of the real or imaginary damage inflicted or else by feeling indisolubly linked to it with a phantom tie. Other types of complaints are the feeling of dependancy towards something oppressive, be it a substance, such as alcohol, smoking, drugs or overeating, or it may be a person or a situation.

      "title": "Sexual Jealousy Leads to Devil’s Butchering: Case Report on Postmortem Mutilation",
      "abstract": "A murderer may try several methods to dispose off or hide a dead body, so that his crime can remain undetected. The most frequently used methods include burial of corpse in an unusual or impervious place; charring the body beyond the state of recognition; dropping the weighted down body in the open sea or river; dismemberment of the body and further chemical treatment. Dismemberment is a relatively rare method in which, after killing the victim, the murderer uses a very sharp cutting heavy weapon (a saw, axe, meat chopper, etc.) to sever the limbs and cut the body into small pieces. This is generally done immediately after the crime, although a long time may pass between the two events. The dismembered body may then be further subjected to chemical treatment (acid digestion) that will result in non-identification of the deceased and hence non-discovery of the murderer. This presentation describes one such incident of dismemberment and mutilation of a dead body by the perpetrator, where the body was divided into 6 pieces and stored in a refrigerator, with the intention of disposing off the different segments in the near future by the perpetrator. Postmortem examination revealed the nature of weapon used to mutilate the corpse.",

      "title": "Contamination After Physical or Psychological Violations",
      "abstract": "Abstract Significant feelings of mental contamination, and the associated compulsions, are generated by physical or psychological violation. The effects of significant violations include fear, avoidance, anger, and in many instances a desire to retaliate. The primary contaminant is a person, and anything associated with the violator—people, places, or objects—can generate disturbing feelings of internal dirtiness and a desire to wash away the contamination. Compulsive washing tends to be futile in cases of mental contamination because the site of the dirtiness is inaccessible. In cases of physical violation the precipitating event is clear. For example, the victim recognizes the emergence of feelings of dirtiness and contamination after a sexual assault. Mental contamination is common after sexual assaults and the sense of pollution can persist for years. In cases of psychological violation, however, the link between the event/s and the emergence of mental contamination is obscure and perplexing. Betrayals, humiliation, and degradation can be traumatic even though “no skin is broken. Surges of feelings of mental contamination, are provoked by mental events such as intrusive images, memories, and thoughts, and also by secondary sources of contamination (people or places associated with the violator). Cognitive behavior therapy is the treatment of choice in cases of mental contamination which develop after psychological violation. In cases that develop after a physical violation the cognitive therapy is supplemented by techniques used for treating PTSD. Treated cases are described.",

      "abstract": "Dogs show different types of aggressiveness, not necessarily genetic or pathologic, when they attack people for different causes. In general, their attacks are expressions of behavior depending on the animal’s breeding and learning and of varying manifestations depending on situations generated by man (3) (4) . Dogs have a complex social structure in which roles are determined in terms of dominant and subordinate. This is fundamental in the administration of resources and the cohesion of the pack. The domestic dog shows behavioral patterns proper of this social organization towards the people they live with as they substitute its pack. Hierarchies are established during its growth in which it has to learn its subordinate position under a dominance not always exerted by its owner which gives rise to conflicts such as aggression (4) (5) . When it is manifested, it is described as aggression for dominance. In general, dog owners constitute the group of people more frequently bitten, what can be explained through a higher contact with the animal and their tendency to a lesser avoidance of other people’s dogs and even of dogs without owners (6)",

For example, when I kick a rock, I do not do anything wrong, nor is the rock wronged. On the other hand, if I kicked an innocent child, I do something wrong, but more importantly I wrong the child. I argue that sentience (the capacity to feel pleasure and pain) and rational autonomy (the conscious capacity to self-govern) are both individually sufficient for moral standing and disjunctively necessary for moral standing. I argue against a variety of alternative positions such as consciousness (the capacity to have any experience such as the color blue), biological life, and dispositional agency, in order to strengthen my position. Moral status refers to the set of normative features governing the way we treat those with moral standing. When it comes to moral status regarding moral patients, I argue that they have at least two kinds of basic moral interests which are based on their wellbeing and their autonomy. I argue in favor of a hierarchical system of moral status whereby moral patients and agents possess higher, weaker, or equal moral status based on their capacities. I conclude by arguing that we may have impersonal obligations (moral obligations owed to no moral patient) towards the environment because the natural environment may be a possible source of beauty. Thus, our moral obligation would be to beauty rather than the environment itself.",

      "title": "Physical and mental violence as the main types of criminal violence",
      "abstract": "The article states that there is no clear diﬀerentiation of types of violence either in domestic legislation or in criminal law science. The following are defined as objective and subjective signs of violence: illegal behavior that manifests itself in the external environment and is expressed in specific conscious acts of human activity; targeting another person's body; the presence of a specific addressee (the victim — in the case of direct violence, or his relatives — in the case of indirect violence); can take place both against and against the will of another person (victim); the intentional character of the person's behavior; the ability to influence the unconscious and cause physical, moral, property damage to another person; the presence of a goal to cause harm to another person of a certain nature. The dominant position is the division of violence into physical and mental. An objection was expressed against the existence of formulas: «violence = physical violence», «threat = mental violence» (this is exactly the vision of the developers of the new Criminal Code of Ukraine). This approach, in contrast to the generally accepted division of violence into physical and mental, determines the thesis that violence exists exclusively in the form of physical harm to the victim, and reduces another type of violence, mental, to a threat. Whereas mental violence in the current Criminal Code of Ukraine manifests itself not only through threats, but also coercion, coercion, influence, terrorizing, etc. The thesis that physical violence can manifest itself not in active actions, but in the form of inaction, has been criticized. However, even examples simulated by scientists refute this approach. It is supported by the idea that murder is also a manifestation of violence, since it is committed in a violent way, at the same time, violence does not include the destruction and damage of someone else's property. Although physical violence is traditionally considered the most dangerous, in some cases mental violence can cause irreparable damage to a person's health. Signs of mental violence as a deliberate, criminally illegal and socially dangerous act are also the active nature of the behavior (as in the case of physical violence), the influence on the psyche of another person against their will, as a result of which harm is caused to the health or life of a person. Key words: violence, aggression, physical violence, mental violence, psychological violence, types of violence, threat, harm, murder, destruction of property, action, inaction, influence, intimidation.",

      "title": "The Influence of the Inner Man on the Apparent Human Behavior (Christian Exegetical View)",
      "abstract": "This working paper seeks to explain the influence of the inner man on human behavior in general and the Christian believer in particular . Because there is a complete conviction among some that the inner man (unseen) is responsible for sin -as in the case of righteousness- and it may also stem from it, since the fall into Original sin until today. If it is not directly by: heart, soul, spirit, mind with free will, then it will be through responsibility or tacit participation (by lack of prohibition or taming) for sinful behavior that may come from outside through the flesh and its senses (sight, hearing, etc.), because: The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things (Matt. 12:35). And this is done through the behavior of human satisfaction of needs (physical and spiritual), because the flesh lusts against the spirit, (Galatians 5:17). With taking into account all factors of the surrounding external environment -economic, social and cultural environment, etc- which is difficult to control. In confronting the believer's faith and religious convictions that affect his behavior. The study also assumes that satisfying the human needs of the believer -originally- is spiritual satisfaction and not physical, for it is written: But you are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you (Romans 8:9). But this also does not prevent from being the opposite to be the correct . not only because what is born of the flesh is a flesh -John 3: 6- but also because of the negligence and weakness of the spirit and his distance from God (and all inner man). This study is complementary and explanatory to previous studies by the researcher in the same field, which also means that this study does not agree with Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs (1943).Although spiritual human satisfaction is difficult to deal with quantitatively -because who can be filled and satisfied from God's love and mercy- the study assumes metaphorically to simplify the explanation: that the sum of the physical and spiritual needs of a person is (100%). (50%) for the flesh, (50%) for the spirit. And that the competition between them to achieve the maximum satisfaction (material or spiritual) -according to the nature of the formation of each one- will be at the expense of the other. But this level of equilibrium (50, 50) is rejected in the Holy Book (Deuteronomy 30: 19; Gal 5: 17; Revel 3: 15). So let us assume that the human spirit has reached a saturation level (90% spiritual satisfaction). And let us also borrow from the science of physics : “ The law of communicating vessels” to use it in: Analyzing human behavior of satisfaction. Therefore, according to this law : Thelevel (90 %) of spiritual satisfaction means that the spirit will lead the whole person (as one unit) -the whole flesh (and the senses, feelings) and the whole inner man (the heart, mind, etc.)- to be under his Control. At the same level -(90 %) approximately. The opposite is also correct. That is, when physical satisfaction reaches ( 90 %), the spirit and the whole inner man will weake and slip into materialistic and mundane -approximately- with the same rate (90 %). As so on, with all cases of human satisfaction -be it 70% or 60%- (spiritual or physical), which we will study to clarify and explain the subject of the study.",

Substandard structures are erected, and collapse, with loss of lives. Doctors in intensive care units fail to wash their hands between patients, and contribute to the problem of cross-infection. There are many situations like these in which harm flows from an action which, in contrast to an error, is quite deliberate in its conceptualisation and execution, even though no harm was intended. We have said that errors are entirely involuntary. The moral implications of an injury are quite different if some element of choice by the actor was involved in the actions which led to its causation. A mistake (mistakes being that subset of errors in which the flaw lies in the decision or plan) is defined as an error precisely because the actor believes that the action is an appropriate way of achieving an objective safely. He or she is acting in good faith, trying to do the best possible thing, but failing. A decision or plan can no longer be considered a mistake (or any other kind of error under the definition in chapter 3) if the person concerned knows that there is a more acceptable alternative, or an alternative more likely to achieve the given objective safely, and yet deliberately chooses the less satisfactory alternative.",

The possibilities of application in accordance with the acquired experiences and literary research might be introduced as followingly: The assessment of the biomechanical content of the selected criminalistic vestiges; the up-tonow mostly analyzed is the biomechanical content of the trasological phenomena, partly even graphological print. The extreme mechanical loading of organism, e.g. hitting by fist, stick or by some other object. The biomechanical estimation of falls from height most often out of the house window. It happens very frequently that the aggressor attack with the intention to kill and he throws the victim out of the window; during the investigation he defends himself by stating that the victim fell out by some unhappy chance. Among the very frequent injuries, we meet in criminological practice, are the head injuries caused by a blunt object. These blunt head injuries are significant partly for their exposed position and partly because nearly each time the attacked body part comprises a vital organ. The most realistic variant of the mathematical model would certainly be appropriate to compare the results with empirical data. These possibilities are rather very limited as the corresponding data concerning the mechanical qualities of skull and brain substance are not available and the standards describing the brain injury are not known. The experimentally reached results enlarge the contemporary basis of knowledge in biomechanics, criminalistics and forensic medicine.",

But the punishments for the various sorts of insolence in speech or action with regard to the gods, which a man can show in word or deed, have to be proclaimed after we have provided an exordium.

Implied motion rather than smooth or continuous motion was presented. The initially moving object was rated as more causal and as exerting more force if upon contact the initially stationary object was launched into motion or shattered, but the initially stationary object was rated as more causal and as exerting more force if upon contact the initially moving object stopped or shattered (and the initially stationary object remained stationary and intact). An object that did not shatter or that shattered into fewer fragments was rated as more causal and as exerting more force than an object that shattered into more fragments. If the initially moving object stopped upon contact and the initially stationary object remained stationary, the initially stationary object was rated as more causal. The results are not consistent with theories of phenomenal causality that suggest (1) moving objects are always perceived as more causal and as exerting more force than stationary objects and (2) perception of causality is identical to perception of force.",

      "abstract": "Disposing of a piece of paper with a textual apotropaios might be even more problematic than storing or sharing it. A perfect example is a type of amulet named “heavenly letters”, “luck letters” or “chain letters”. Such a letter is often framed by its owner as an object or sacred/magic artifact which can act and produce non-beneficial effect on its own, without any human agency: one does not necessarily need to read or otherwise handle a luck letter to receive bad luck, while to receive good luck certain actions must be undertaken. Most often bad luck or a curse affects those who ignore or neglect a luck letter, and some of the later examples of this genre define at length different punishments for those who tear it or throw it away. Finding themselves in this situation, people turn to contemporary traditions of discarding sacred or malign artifacts. However, people often choose an intermediate strategy of giving a letter away, taking it to a specialist or discreetly passing it to a neighbor. The latter case is considered a malign magical activity. The intertwining between a luck letter as an autonomous force with a potential negative effect, “lay” senders and receivers and “specialists”, all bound together with the problem of discarding a magical object forms a complex and dynamic network of actors.",

      "abstract": "Physical inactivity and a passive lifestyle induce a plethora of negative effects on human physical and mental health. Physical activity is a fundamental human necessity as it enables the preservation of a healthy organism and its organ systems. Recreation entails every form of body movement that increases energy consumption while the body is in the state of inaction. It encompasses fitness, training, and competition, house chores, and other activities that require bodily exertion. Regular implementation of physical activity can benefit overall health and lower the probability of chronic illnesses. However, the lack of recreation presents a globally spread problem. Physical inactivity is a state of insufficient activity, whether it is inadequate with its intensity, length, and/or frequency; its insufficiency disables normal performance of different organs, metabolic regulation processes, construction, and maintenance of non-fat body mass, and preservation of motor abilities. The quality of life is mostly defined as an overall estimation or a personal perspective of an individual with regard to the entire welfare and pleasures of life. The usual understanding of lifestyle quality based on health factors is established on the definition of the WHO; the quality of life is therefore construed as the state of complete physical, mental and social welfare, not just the absence of illness and inability. The aim of this study was to determine the level of activity and quality of life of the working population.",

      "abstract": "Fear and anxiety are common in dogs. Separation related disorders, fear-related aggression, and noise phobia are some of the most common problem-related behaviours in dogs. Fear and anxiety cause stress which could lead to chronic stress. Dogs that suffer from fear-related problems are often euthanized or abandoned. Dogs with fear-related aggression could be potentially dangerous to humans since the fear triggers an aggressive response which might cause the dog to bite. Fear is an adaptive response that increases the survival of a species and results in a physical and physiological response that prepares the individual for fight or flight. However, when this behaviour is generalised and/or triggered too easily and/or is expressed intensively, it usually becomes problematic for the dog, humans and society.\r\nFear-related aggression occurs when the dog encounters a problem stimulus which it cannot avoid. Fear-related aggression is often misinterpreted as protective aggression, e.g. that the dog wants to protect its owner. In reality, the dog is frightened and wants to defend itself from danger. Dogs could show signs of fear-related aggression by snarling, snapping or biting.\r\nDogs with noise phobia are commonly afraid of thunder, fireworks and/or gunshots. Fear of noises and thunderstorms tend to escalate, i.e. worsening with each exposure. A dog with a fear of gunshots might eventually become fearful of similar sounds or events associated with the noise (generalised fear). Panting, shaking or flight attempts could be signs of noise phobia.\r\nSeparation-related behaviour occurs when the dog is separated from the owner. It could be caused by a lack of habituation to being alone. Destructive behaviour, vocalisation or hyperactivity are some signs of separation-related disorders.\r\nBehaviour therapy, changes in the environment and medication are common methods for treatment of fear-related aggression, noise phobia and separation-related disorders, the effects of these treatments are discussed.",

If we really believe that it is God who wants us to do something then we are more likely to do it (or at least feel more guilty if we do not do it) than if George or Tony or even our guru asks us to do it – unless we believe that our guru is God, or is the only one with a direct hotline to Him (or Her).

      "title": "Causal Theories of Action",
      "abstract": "Causal theories of action are attempts to develop an account of actions in terms of events (typically bodily movements and their effects) which have the right kind of causal ancestry. The causal ancestry must be traced back to some kind of intentional state (or combination of intentional states) in the agent, such intentional state (or states) must have the right kind of content, and it must cause the bodily movement (or other effect) in the ‘right’ way. Causal accounts differ on the nature of the intentional state, the nature of the content it must have, and the specification of the ‘right’ kind of causal connection to bodily movements or other effects. Causal accounts also differ on the identification of the action itself. Some acounts say that the action is the bodily movement, provided that it was caused in the right way and had the right kind of effects. Others identify the action with the triggering intentional state (called a volition or trying), provided that it has the right kind of effects. Yet others identify the action with the composite event of the intentional state's causing the appropriate effects. Finally there are those which fail to identify the action with any of these events or combinations of them.",

      "abstract": "Erving Goffman (1963) describes three types of “stigma,” or attributes that are socially discrediting: violations of accepted behavior or belief, membership in a despised national, religious, or racial group, and abominations of the body. The final category involves physical characteristics that compromise bodily appearance or functioning. Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance. Like the other types of stigma, undesirable physical characteristics isolate some individuals, disqualifying them from “full social acceptance” (p. 1). Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the non‐stigmatized is often awkward and uncertain. Tension is manifest in people's tendency to avoid eye contact, make guarded references to the stigma, or avoid everyday words that suddenly become taboo; it leads both parties to consider avoiding or withdrawing from encounters.",

      "title": "The Phenomenon of Aggressive Behavior of Learners in the School Situation.",
      "abstract": "Aggression is an internal process of human being in relationship with his/her self, other persons and the environment. The external manifestations of aggression, whether constructive or destructive, are not the starting point of aggression. Aggression develops from childhood and continues into adulthood. In this regard Chamberlain (2000:1-4) even states that aggression can develop from before birth. Aggression starts within the psychological world of the individual. The way in which the individual interprets his/her perception will elicit an emotional response that will affect the person's decision on what to do with his/her interpretation of the world. What matters is the way it is expressed-either constructive or destructive behaviour. Aggression is expressed in a constructive manner if it is about the survival and personal and healthy growth of the individual, family, group and/or the community. Aggression is expressed in destructive manner if it harms self and/or others and/or the environment (Tesser, 1995:383-418). According to Kruger, Rech and Van Staden (1993:9) aggression can viewed as any type of behaviour that is directed to harm, hurt, inflict pain or destroy another person when this person is motivated to avoid such behaviour. Aggression can also be self-directed-consciously or unconsciously (self-critical, self-harm, verbal threats and assault). Psycho-social factors that contributes towards aggressive behaviour include inability to cope with frustration; uncomfortable livelihood; exposure to aggressive models such as violence in the media and parents with aggressive behaviour; poor socio-economic circumstances especially in urbanized areas; poor family relationships; times of social stress (such as high inflation rate and increasing divorce statistics), and rejection by peers (Pepler & Sedighdeilami, 1998:205-214; Collings, 1994:35-37; Pulkkinen & Ramirez, 1991:69; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993:9-10). Situational factors can contribute towards aggressive behaviour including competitive sports, physical pain, anxiety, being in a crowed; and air and noise pollution (Smith & Furlong: 1998, 2021-202; Kruger & Van Staden, 1993:10). Biological factors contributing to aggression include constitutional factors (a person's temperament); genetics; hormonal factors; neuro-anatomical factors such as neurotransmission and neuro-logical disturbances (Mooij: 374; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10-11). The self-determination theory state that the motivational orientation have been linked to how individuals regulate self-esteem in other potentially threatening contexts and social interactions (Hodgens, Koestner, & Duncan, 1996; Hodgins, Liebeskind, & Schartz, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). Further, Deci and Ryan (1991) stated that when self-regulation proceeds according to an unintegrated aspect of the person, as with the ego involvement on controlled behaviour, the experienced emotion will be less flexible, more pressured, and more subjective to defensive reaction that less fully express one's integrated self. Investigators have operational zed self -determination in various ways, including the aspiration that individuals endorse (Kasser & Ryan, 1993, 1996), coercive elements of the social context (Deci, Spiegel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kauffmann, 1982; Ryan, Mims, & Koestner, 1983), self-reported reasons for engaging in various behaviours (Vallerand & Bissonette, 1992; Vallerand, Blais, Briere & Pelletier, 1989), and individual differences in motivational orientations (Deci & Ryan, 1985a; Hodgins, Liebeskind, et al, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). This latter work on motivational orientations evolve from the assumption that people differ in the extent to which they regulate their behaviour based on autonomy and choice, or based on pressure (either real or imagined; Deci & Ryan, 1985a). Same-level or cross--level processes (interaction) may exist. …",

In this regard it can be said that no one is free from and psychological, psycho-physical and psycho-social disorders from which we can derive that no one mentally healthy. But the concept of mental health defined free from the disorders those are prolonged and panic in nature. As the concept of mental health is subjective in nature, it varies from person to person. Besides free from the disorders, a person should pose some of the other positive characteristics to deal with the society effectively. Marry (1958) stated that, a person can be considered mentally healthy with the following characteristics such as (a) Positive attitudes toward himself/herself; (b) Realization of own potentialities through action; (c); Unification of in personality; (d) Degree of independence of social influences; (e) observations of the world around; and (f) Positive adapts to everyday life. Briefly, it can be said that positive mental health of the person make able to an individual to stand on his own two feet without making undue demands or impositions of others. In this regard the role of happiness in day to day life can make the individual more skilled to fight with different mental disorders. The present article is intended to find out the effects of happiness in day to day life in a social situation to deal with different mental disorders to make the individual mentally healthy and prosperous in life.",

There are numerous Aayaat and Ahadith that attests to this.The Quran reads:“Allah does not charge a soul except its capacity”(Baqarah:286).Thus the Prophet Muhammad (sal allah alihi wsalam) said:“Surely the Deen (of Islam) is easy”(Bukhaari).If a person is unable to carry out what the Sharee‘ah (Islamic Law) expects of him/her, due to illness, injury,traveling, ignorance, or even old age, then the law grants a concession. There are certain principles based on Qur’aan and Sunan.  That promotes the easiness and leniency of Islam and its Sharee’ah. One such principle is as follows: “Difficulty warrants ease’’The above principle means that if difficulty exists then the law grants easiness in the form of a concession. An example of this principle is, if a person is on travel the Sharee‘ah allows that person to shorten his/her prayers or if the same person is fasting, he/she is allowed to break fast. The allowance is given mainly because the law recognizes the hardships/difficulties in travel and therefore wants to facilitate ease in worship. Concessions (rukhsah) in Islam are allowed to lighten ‘ibaadaat (acts of worship), mu‘aamalaat (transactional relationships), and other matters.Zarurah (necessity) and Hajah (need) is also the Maqasid al-Shariah protection tools in Islamic law. Salam, Istisna, Muzarbah etc contracts were considered permitted to remove the hardships from people.",

Stress may compromise health if it exceeds the individual's ability to compensate or adapt. Substantial or prolonged stress may result in physiological disorders or behavioral changes leading to trauma or disease in reptiles. For captive reptiles, a majority of traumatic and physical disorders are directly influenced by enclosure design and husbandry issues.

      "abstract": "Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder 1 limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive, it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional, it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential :that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas.",

Part 2 of this book describes the good goals that God might be seeking to produce in his Universe—beauty; creatures having knowledge (in a largely internalist sense), having their good desires satisfied, with a free will to do actions that promote each others’ well‐being, being of use to others, and worshipping God. Part 3 shows how the possibility of moral evil, and the actual occurrence of natural evil (providing knowledge of possible good and bad actions, and the scope for good response) are necessary to secure these ends. God has the right to allow some creatures to suffer for the benefit of others, so long as he compensates them in this life or after death. The expected value of allowing the evils in order to achieve the good goals is positive.",

      "abstract": "Rameau's nephew, it seems, is a bit of a cipher: by turns foolish and sagacious, dissolute and upstanding, beggarly and magisterial. Diderot (1966: 58) would have us question the nephew's sanity; radical personal inconsistency seems to signal a breakdown of mental health. Yet it's not crazy to think that someone could be courageous in physical but not moral extremity, or be moderate with food but not sex, or be honest with spouses but not with taxes. If we take such thoughts seriously, we'll qualify our attributions: “physical courage” or “moral courage,” instead of “courage,” and so on. Would things were so simple. With a bit of effort, we can imagine someone showing physical courage on the battlefield, but cowering in the face of storms, heights, or wild animals. Here we go again: “battlefield physical courage,” “storms physical courage,” “heights physical courage,” and “wild animals physical courage.” Things can get still trickier: Someone might exhibit battlefield courage in the face of rifle fire but not in the face of artillery fire (Miller 2000: 54—9). If we didn't grow sick of it, we could play this little game all day. Such sport is more than simpleminded diversion, however; it is the beginning of an empirically adequate alternative to globalism. But I've not yet fully established the need for such an alternative: There are defensible interpretations of the data more friendly to globalist conceptions of character than is mine. Nevertheless, I’d like to think I’ve come by my views honestly; comparing the going alternatives, I now try to show, gives us good reason to favor my way of doing things.",

Sexual misfits experience frustration in relation to their sexuality due to a misfit between 1) the physical and social practices that might constitute a sexuality, 2) the language that might be involved in accomplishing those practices or in reflecting on them, and 3) the categories (both practical and theoretical) that structure the social world and provide it with intelligibility. Sexuality is understood to be both one sociological variable that we use to identify ourselves and others, and the effect of a cloud of other sociological variables. Misfits are people who discover that they don't belong to the class that they have been taken (by themselves or by others) to belong to, because it happens that some criteria that nobody had ever mentioned (or would ever think to mention) has not been satisfied, or because they either lack an essential secondary property or possess a disqualifying one. The absence or presence of such a hidden or secondary property may not even be apparent until a certain event or interaction occurs, until a certain context emerges, or until a certain situation arises.",

This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object.

      "abstract": "’ “What’s the use of preventing a man from stumbling when he’s on a sinking ship ?” “Because if he breaks his ankle he won’t be able to swim”, I suggested. “But why try to save him from breaking his ankle if you can try to save him from losing his life?” “Because I know how to do the former but not the latter”, I told him rather testily’. The Net , by Iris Murdoch, p. 112. This appears an unambiguous title; we talk frequently, both about ‘prevention’ and ‘family breakdown’. Yet if we reflect on each of these terms there are good reasons for doubt and uncertainty. Does the death of a father constitute the breakdown (or break-up?) of a family? Has a family in which the eldest child is unloved by mother and overprotected by father broken down? Or a family from which the mother is away in mental hospital, possibly for a short time? In brief do we use the term to refer to the lack of the physical wholeness of a family or to a failure in one of the essential functions of the family? If we refer to both these features at the same time it is likely that the term is being stretched beyond its usefulness. If we turn to the other term in the title, prevention, the lack of clarity is much more in evidence. The idea of prevention has a long history as far as public provision for social welfare is concerned. It is possible to observe at least three stages in the development of this idea. Firstly, it was considered that people should be prevented from recourse to dependence on such social provision as existed by the availability early in life of certain guiding influences. Thus, education was seen ‘as one of the most important means of eradicating the germs of pauperism for the rising generation and of securing in the minds and morals of the people the best protection for the institutions of society’.",

      "title": "Kelola Bumi Peduli Ekologi Menurut Kej 1:28",
      "abstract": "Gen. 1:28 presents the three blessings of God to humans in the form procreation, natural subdue and rule over creatures. These three blessings must be placed in the context of human creation as image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26-27) so that he becomes his co-worker in cultivating nature and pastoring all His creatures (Gen. 1:28). It was on this purpose that God placed humans in the garden of Eden and gave the task of cultivating and maintaining them (Gen. 2:4-8,15). The Sabbath of God, which became a crown of His creative work, was explored as a model for humans to carry out their missionary work (Gen. 2:1-3). As God rests after six days of work, man must know the limits in cultivating nature and mastering other creatures so as to avoid exploitative greed. The catastrophe of the Flood was the impact of the failure of humans to become partners with God and the presence of the figur of Noah reveals symbolically efforts to preserve the environment or care fo the ecology (Gen. 6-9). The ark that Noah made was like a house, a place to protect and care for all living creatures and their existence was threatened with extinction. Gen. 1:26-28; 2:1-3; 2:4-8,15 and Gen. 6-9 inspire us to care about ecology.&#x0D; Kej 1:28 memaparkan tiga berkat Allah kepada manusia yang berupa prokreasi, penaklukan alam dan penguasaan makhluk-makhluk ciptaan lainnya. Ketiga berkat itu harus ditempatkan pada konteks penciptaan manusia sebagai gambar dan rupa Allah (Kej 1:26-27) sehingga menjadi rekan kerja-Nya dalam mengolah alam dan menggembalakan segenap makhluk ciptaan-Nya (Kej 1:28). Atas tujuan inilah Allah menempatkan manusia di taman Eden dan memberi tugas mengusahakan dan memeliharanya (Kej 2:4-8,15). Sabat Allah yang menjadi mahkota karya penciptaan-Nya pun dieksplor sebagai model bagi manusia dalam menjalani karya misinya (Kej 2:1-3). Sebagaimana Allah beristirahat setelah enam hari berkarya demikianlah manusia harus tahu batas dalam mengolah alam dan menguasai makhluk ciptaan lainnya sehingga terhindar dari kerakusan yang eksploitatif. Malapetaka Air Bah adalah dampak dari gagalnya manusia menjadi rekan kerja Allah dan kehadiran figur Nuh menyingkapkan secara simbolis upaya pemeliharaan lingkungan atau peduli ekologi (Kej 6-9). Bahtera yang dibuat Nuh ibarat sebuah rumah, tempat perlindungan dan pemeliharaan segala makhluk yang hidup dan keberadaannya terancam kemusnahan. Kej 1:26-28; 2:1-3; 2:4-8,15 dan Kej 6-9 menginspirasi kita untuk peduli ekologi.",

      "title": "Investigation of Food and Relative Risk Probability of Having Five Different Diseases, Including Diabetes Using Collected Food Data Over A 6.5-Year Period Based on GHMethod: Math-Physical Medicine (No. 492)",
      "abstract": "The author is a professionally trained mathematician, physicist and engineer. His view of health and medicine is similar to his past experience on designing a physical object, such as a building structure or a working machine, which he calls an “object”. The object’s strength or its expected lifespan is similar to the health conditions and longevity of a human being based on the following three key factors: (1) The original strength of the object’s material which is similar to the genetic factors of a human body. (2) The engineering design and site construction of this object are similar to the fundamental influential causes, including lifestyle details, life-long habits, and environmental factors, on the human health. Among those external causes, if the author has to pick up one category which has the most influence above of all that is the “food”. (3) The object endures different operational problems due to external forces or impacts which are similar to various diseases suffered by humans. After the object experiences external forces or impacts, we use some structural reinforcements to fix the building’s damaged cracks or replace the malfunctioned part of the machine. These engineering actions are similar to the “medical treatments” doctors provide patients. The medical treatments, including medication interventions (oral drugs or biochemical injections), necessary surgeries, or certain organ transplants are similar to the engineering repair of the damaged object. This article emphasizes the relationship between causes and results such as symptoms of diseases. It particularly addresses the inter-relationship of 5 selected diseases: cancers, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic kidney diseases (CKD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and type 2 diabetes (T2D), where the most important cause for most diseases is “food”. This food category in his study contains 25 defined elements include input data of food are collected via the developed iPhone APP. There are 5 elements for “Food Quantity”: breakfast amount, lunch amount, dinner amount, amount of between-meals snacks and fruits, and the average daily food consumption amount. In addition, there are 20 selected elements for “Food Quality” (see Figure 1). The combined Food score is the average value of both food quantity score and food quality score.",

In all seventy cases, murder was the culmination of an interchange between an offender and victim, resembling what Goffman termed a \"character contest,\" a confrontation in which opponents sought to establish or maintain \"face\" at the other's expense by remaining steady in the face of adversity. The transaction took a sequential form: the victim issued what the offender deemed an offensive move; the offender typically retaliated with a verbal or physical challenge; a \"working\" agreement favoring the use of violence was forged with the victim's response; battle ensued leaving the victim dead or dying; the manner of the offender's exiting was shaped by his relationship to the victim and the moves of his audience.",

This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

If an individual’s behavior or motives are altruistic, one shows concern for the happiness and welfare of other people rather than just for oneself. One is selfless and not selfish. To express it in another way, altruism is the renunciation of the self and an exclusive concern and care for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions. Giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religions. Altruism is also a motivation to provide a value to a party who must be anyone but the self, while duty and loyalty are somewhat moral obligation of a person toward a specific individual (God or a king) or collective body (a government). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. Pure altruism is an instinctively “giving” value without any regard to rewards or the benefits that recognition of the giving may bring. The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is the opposite of egoism.",

      "abstract": "It is investigated whether killing delicts as a \"solution\" of conflicts between partners are the expression of a fateful situative restraint, or whether it is the personal disposition of the committer which entails killing. The fundamentals of the discussion are examinations of 98 criminals with killing delicts, 36 of whom \"solved\" a conflict in partnership by killing the partner. The 36 separation crimes can be subdivided into four groups according to the prevailing causes. 16 happened due to the partner's intention to leave, 14 due to humiliation and severe offence, 3 due to material self-interest, and 3 in states of delusion. For each of the four groups a typical representative in his constellation of situation and personality is described. Generalized, it will be questioned under which circumstances someone develops the will to kill the partner, and who possesses the capability to realize this will. It can be shown by systematical exploration of their personality by means of objective personality testing procedures that almost all criminals who have committed murder show a conspicuous structure of personality. Hysterical and/or sociopathic properties predispose a person to acts of personally-impertinent or personally-short-sighted violence.",

      "title": "Antecedentes psicológicos del consecuencialismo intransigente",
      "abstract": "People make moral decisions with a focus either on the morality of their actions (for example, killing one person) or on the value of the consequences of such actions (for example, saving the lives of five people). The first type of morality is called ?deontological?, the second type is called ?consequentialist?.\r\nDeontological morality can take extreme, uncompromising forms when the decision maker is unwilling to violate a particular norm irrespective of the consequences of such a violation. Research (Baron & Spranca, 1997; Tetlock, 2003) on ?protected? or ?sacred? values has characterized these uncompromising forms of deontological morality as irrational. For example, the prohibition against killing innocent people under any circumstances might block the sacrifice of one victim in order to save many lives. In the studies on sacred or protected values, consequentialism is the rational standard of comparison against which deontological decisions are compared.\r\nIn this thesis we suggest that consequentialist moral decisions can also take uncompromising forms that can be as irrational as uncompromising deontological decisions. Consequentialist decision makers have limited access to information when forecasting the outcomes of their decisions. When calculating the payoff of a course of action, decision makers should make a precise estimate of the actual moral and physical costs of the chosen action as well as a precise estimate of the probability of the actual occurrence of the intended goal.\r\nPsychological distance gives rise to an abstract representation of actions that makes goals more prominent and can help us ignore the actions? immediate harmful effects.\r\nOur main hypothesis is that psychological distance promotes a mindset in which decision makers are less prone to make such precise estimates of the cost of the action and probability of the goal. In this way, consequentialist decisions become riskier and crueler. In other words, psychological distance should be a main predictor of uncompromising consequentialism.\r\nWe tested and confirmed this hypothesis through seven experiments. In Experiments 1, 2 and 4, psychological distance increased the choices of riskier, potentially ineffective consequentialist courses of action. In Experiments 3, 5 and 6 participants were willing to subscribe alternative, radical ?solutions? that seriously challenged strong moral normative intuitions (for example, the prohibition against killing your loved ones) in pursuit of an extremely abstract, absurdly idealized, object of endeavor (to restore justice in the world). Finally, Experiment 7 confirmed an additional important effect of an abstract mindset: decision makers? higher moral certitude and satisfaction.\r\nIn our view, these findings will help us to understand (add to our understanding of) the dynamics of moral decision-making in those settings in which authorities and experts make decisions. While some professional advice recommends that decision-makers maintain distance from their emotions, our findings suggest that psychological distance can prompt potentially cruel and ineffective decisions that ignore the key costs of some consequentialist courses of action.\r\n?",

      "title": "Consumption",
      "abstract": "Consumption Mavis Reimer From the time that the word consumption entered English from Latin in the late fourteenth century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it carried a double meaning: it could refer to the “wasting of the body” generally (and so came to signify such illnesses as pulmonary disease) and it could refer to the “action or fact of destroying or being destroyed,” such as when a fire reduces something to ashes. Following these nominal uses in English, the verb consume was coined almost immediately to mean, first, to destroy something physically, and shortly thereafter, in its intransitive form, “to eat or drink; to ingest” specifically and to use or exploit resources more generally, and, in its transitive form, to spend (for example, money), especially wastefully, and to squander (for example, goods), as well as to “engage the full attention or energy of (a person).” Linked, then, from its beginnings as an English word to the body, the market, and forms of response, and associated simultaneously or alternately with necessity, engagement, disease, destruction, and waste, consumption has never been a simple idea. Its complications persist. In the introduction to The Oxford Handbook of the History of Consumption—a thirty-four-chapter, 695-page overview, published in 2012, of the state of scholarly study in the field—Frank Trentmann defines the contemporary study of consumption as including questions about “[t]he acquisition, use, and waste of things, taste and desire” (1); as “a major point of interface” between history and such disciplines as anthropology, sociology, and geography, “stimulating new directions in cultural, global, and material history” (2); and as a prompt to historians, including historians of the present, “to think about the production, representation, and circulation of things, and about the nature of symbolic communication, material practices, and identity formations” (2). Given all of this, Trentmann’s [End Page 1] opening assertion—that “[c]onsumption is a mirror of the human condition” (1)—does not seem to be an overreaching claim. Eating has been said to be “the prototype” of consumption, as Alan Warde observes in his chapter in Trentmann’s volume (377), the first instance from which other kinds of consumption are derived. There are some senses in which this would seem obviously to be true. Standard anthropological accounts of the long history of the development of human societies, for example, focus on the transitions in food sources available to those societies, with forager or hunter-gatherer groups displaying social organizations distinctly different from those of agricultural groups. In The Raw and the Cooked, Claude Lévi-Strauss famously argues that cooking food is the means by which humans first distinguish themselves from other animals and begin to manufacture culture: “not only does cooking mark the transition from nature to culture, but through it and by means of it, the human state can be defined with all its attributes” (164). While he maintains that the categorization of food as raw, cooked, or rotten is basic to all human cuisines (and metaphorically extended to other social activities), what is assigned to each of these categories varies from culture to culture. Once established, however, “culinary traditions remain recognizable over centuries,” according to food researchers, with “eating habits … among the most resistant to change” and “food behaviours … among the last to be abandoned by migrants” (Warde 376–77). The complex commitments of groups to particular food and eating behaviours are noted by Roland Barthes in “Toward a Psychosociology of Contemporary Food Consumption” when he proposes that food is not only a source of nutrition but also “a system of communication, a body of images, a protocol of usages, situations, and behavior” that can be “read” for its semiotic codes as many other everyday practices can be (29).1 In Mythologies, published before the essay on method, Barthes performs such readings of wine and milk, steak and chips, and ornamental cookery, refusing to accept the “falsely obvious” notions of his society (11) and demonstrating that food can be read in relation to national imaginaries, capitalist systems of production, morphological structures of language, temporal organization, and the display of class identities, among other protocols and systems. In Distinction, his detailed analysis of the principles...",

      "title": "The regulatory function of addiction: Maintaining internal cohesion by the drugging of parts of the personality",
      "abstract": "The attempt not to think or to block out particular mental contents is cited by addicts as a motivation for intoxication as frequently as the need to escape any external set of circumstances. Compulsive drug use may therefore be seen as an attempt to obliterate particular states of mind. In this paper addicts are considered as dangerously addicted to a loss of contact with parts of the mind as they are to a given drug. A splitting off, for example, of loving and nurturing or hateful parts of the personality is effected where these cannot be tolerated by or integrated into a pathological internal constellation. Deficits in early caregiving and environment as well as constitutional factors play a part in this. Addiction is therefore seen as an unconscious attempt to maintain a precarious inner equilibrium by destroying contact with parts of the personality, literally through their drugging. In psychic reality or in phantasy this may be felt as a slicing up or tearing to pieces, and so subjugation of objects. A clinical example will illustrate this idea.",

      "abstract": "The people in this situation were faced with an option to help someone in distress, and they did not choose to offer aid. This is a dramatic example of a situation that people face every day. An encounter with a beggar on the street, a request to give blood, or a call from a friend who is lonely or depressed—each is a situation in which someone can do something to benefit someone else. Such activity may be termed positive social action. Such acts as donating money or goods to charity, cooperating with others in carrying out a project, and doing favors for a person in need are typical examples of positive social action. Behavior of this kind may be contrasted with antisocial action, such behavior as aggression, destruction, and selfishness. Some theorists use the term prosocial behavior to stress the contrast with antisocial behavior. Other theorists prefer to use the term altruism, to emphasize the element of selflessness that exists in many helping situations. Altruism is action that benefits other people and is carried out with no expectation of external reward. Whatever words are used and with whatever emphasis, however, such action is worth investigating because it is deemed morally admirable and also contributes to the survival of society (Poplawski, 1985). Most people admire the individual who makes sacrifices so that others may benefit, and probably everyone agrees that society would be better off if everyone were less self-centered.",

      "title": "Physical Activity",
      "abstract": "Physical activity is a significant element in enhancing the population's well-being.[1] Well-being is a condition of feeling good and functioning well, which helps people develop and thrive and control or manage life's negative, painful emotions.[23] Feeling good experiences are the positive emotions that give happiness and life satisfaction.[1] Physical activity improves human health, including mental health and stress tolerance, and thereby experiences pleasant activated feelings of joy and enhances overall well-being.[1] These people exhibit greater productivity, are more socially active, and are economically productive.[2] The World Health Organisation (WHO) has defined physical activity as 'any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure'. It includes all movement accomplished during leisure time, work or transport.[4] Worldwide, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour for prolonged periods cause several adverse effects on health.[56] Sedentary behaviour is well-defined by the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network as 'any waking behaviour such as sitting or leaning with an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalent task (MET) or less'.[7] The report shows that long sedentary times are spent by people around the world, such as Americans spend 7.7 h/day equivalents to 55% of their waking time, Europeans spend 2.7 h a day which is 40% of their leisure time watching television, and Koreans spend 8.3 h of sedentary time.[6] The WHO reports globally, more than a quarter of the world's adult population (1.4 billion adults) are not performing enough physical activity. This is doubled in high-income countries compared to low-income countries.[4] In low-income countries, more physical activity is attributed to the workplace and transport.[8] The prevalence of physical inactivity in South-east Asia is 17%, while in the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean is about 43%.[9] In Malaysia, one in four adults is physically inactive;[10] 20% of adults are physically inactive in Africa.[11] Rapid urbanisation and economic growth and technological advancement and social changes are related to declining physical activity globally and the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).[1213] The cultural values also influence physical activity in some places where women, older people and the underprivileged and disabled population do not get enough opportunities to access safe and affordable. Appropriate programs are required to remain people physically fit.[12] Additionally, lack of time, motivation, energy, fear of injury, sedentary work pattern, affordable facilities are common factors that inhibit people from being physically mobile.[14] Physical inactivity causes around 8% of NCDs and deaths.[15] It is reported as the 4th leading risk factor for death.[16] About 5.3 million people die yearly from physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyles.[16] It is reported by Lee et al. that physical inactivity results in 6%−10% of the significant NCD such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, breast and colon cancer and 9% of premature mortality.[17] Worldwide, 7.2% of deaths due to other causes and 7.6% of deaths due to cardiovascular disease are attributable to physical inactivity.[15] Physical inactivity also contributes to obesity, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, mental health problems and significant NCDs of colon and breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It ultimately leads to early death.[18] Moreover, health-related morbidity affects the population's quality of life and well-being.[16] In addition to this health-related burden, physical inactivity also imposes an enormous financial burden.[16] The attributes causing this financial burden are direct healthcare costs, lost productivity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Data from 142 countries (93·2% of the world's population) showed physical inactivity costs internationally US$ 54 billion/year in direct healthcare in 2013, of which $31·2 billion was paid by the public sector, $12·9 billion by the private sector, and $9·7 billion by households. While lost productivity due to physical inactivity costs INT$ 14 billion related to deaths and lifetime disease burden due to physical inactivity costs 13·4 million DALYs worldwide.[1219] High-income countries bear a more significant financial burden due to healthcare costs (80·8%) and indirect costs (60·4%). In comparison, low-income and middle-income countries bear a large proportion of the disease burden caused by physical inactivity (75·0% of DALYs).[19] Regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, wheeling or any sports activity, is beneficial. It prevents and treats NCDs such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer.[412] Patients benefit from physical activity to prevent obesity and hypertension and improve mental health, quality of life and well-being.[12] The numerous benefits of health and disease eventually reduce the mortality rate.[5] It is found that physical activity promotes weight loss and prevents weight regaining in overweight and obese people.[20] Performing exercise without any significant weight reduction is also beneficial.[5] Strength exercise is a powerful stimulus to improve and maintain bone mass during aging. Regular practice of multi-component exercise, including aerobic, high impact, and/or weight-bearing training for muscle-strengthening, bone-strengthening and whole-body vibration, can be combined with exercise help to increase or prevent the loss of bone density, especially in post-menopausal women.[2122] Regular physical activity in older adults improves their functional fitness,[23] helps to improve physical functioning and psychological well-being[24] and reverses some chronic diseases, and provides personal ability to live independently.[25] Physical activity by doing regular exercise reduces the cardiovascular risk factor by the reduction in body weight, reduction in the low-density lipoprotein level, total cholesterol, and increase in the high-density lipoprotein level as well as increases in insulin sensitivity and control blood glucose levels. It also improves the vascular wall function and oxygenation to the muscles.[26] Thus, the physical activity effectively prevents and treats high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, osteoporosis, cerebral diseases, and complications. Physically active people showed higher satisfaction with life.[27] Reports indicated that physically active cancer survivors had fewer adverse effects and mortality from their cancer than inactive participants.[28] In addition to the health benefits, the active population can participate in productivity and economic development. The indirect benefits are less fossil fuel use, less congested and safer roads and reduced air pollution.[12] According to WHO, adults aged 18-64 years should have at least 150–300 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity each week or at least 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity; or a combination of moderate and vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week.[4] In addition, muscle-strengthening activities involving all major muscle groups should be practiced 2 or more days a week.[4] Moderate activity is similar to walking briskly at 3–4 miles/h. Any activities from occupational or recreational activities such as cycling, household work, yard work, swimming and dancing are considered moderate activities. Approximately five to seven 30-min sessions/week of moderate activity are equal to an intensity of 3–6 METs or about 600–1200 calories expended per week.[26] Vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity includes running, aerobic dancing, heavy yard work, hiking uphill or with a heavy backpack, cycling 10 miles per hour or faster, jumping rope, etc.[29] Awareness of the population is necessary to increase physical activity. Implementing a global action plan and a national plan to increase physical activity can motivate people. Providing facilities and workplace physical activity opportunities would increase physical activity levels. WHO has launched a global action plan to promote physical activity with four objectives and 20 policy actions aimed at reducing physical inactivity in adults and adolescents by 15% by 2030. It recommends more active societies by doing more walking, cycling, sport, active recreation, dance and play.[12] During transport, the use of non-motorised mode by use of cycle, or by walking and more active participation in sports, or passing active time during leisure time is encouraged. Therefore, providing cycling and walking infrastructure, improving road safety and providing the facility for physical activity for the community are necessary.[8] Physical activity has a significant impact on human health and well-being. Moreover, an active population is significantly involved in productivity and economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to increase awareness and motivate people and implement strategies to enhance and maintain the physical activity and well-being of the people.

The experience of fear is the immediate subjective experience of apprehension marked by activation of the fight or flight response. The experience of fear is best understood on the basis of its principle function. According to Seligman (1971), “the great majority of phobias are about object(s) of natural importance to the survival of the species.” In the most severe of circumstances (e.g., in the presence of a fast‐approaching predator), fear activates the organism to flee or battle for its life. A less severe illustration of fear function is seen in day‐to‐day social interactions in which individuals avoid saying or doing embarrassing things in order to prevent social rejection or maintain companionship.",

A curse expresses a wish for misfortune to someone, or more specifically a wish for something unpleasant or violent to happen to a person/group, up to a death wish. Similar to insults and threats, curses contain a negative emotional value and realise a form of verbal violence, as the speech act hints at a harmful event in the future: pending harm is invoked. Jews, Israelis, as well as the State of Israel or Zionism can all be targets of an antisemitic curse.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Animals are usually considered to lack the status of autonomous agents. Nevertheless, they do appear to make ostensible choices. This article considers whether, and how, I should respect animals' choices. I propose a concept of volitionality which can be respected if, and insofar as, doing so is in the best interests of the animal. Applying that concept, I (we) will argue that an animals' choices be respected when the relevant human decision maker's capacities to decide are potentially challenged or compromised. For example, it will be best to respect the animals' choice when the human decision maker: (1) lacks accurate knowledge of the animal's subjective experiences; (2) does not know what will lead to desirable experiences or allow for the avoidance of undesirable ones; (3) is biased; (4) is less aware of the animal's specific situation; (5) cannot appreciate all elements comprehensively, including considering any (content‐neutral) value to the animal being allowed to make and implement a choice, such as where a lack of control or liberty would be unpleasant or where an animal would usefully learn from the process of choice‐making; and (6) when the animal's choice is achievable. This additionally suggests that we may often beneficially choose to set up situations that empower animals to make better choices.",

Trying to establish the identity of unknown dead bodies always pose a challenge to the police, and taxes the resources of the most experienced forensic experts. The usual reasons of non-identification of the dead body are: no proper history available, body often highly decomposed, face crushed or destroyed, mutilation/dismemberment of body parts either by animals or vultures when disposed in isolated lonely places or when the bodies are recovered in skeletonized form, etc. Mass disasters like Earthquakes, railway accidents, tsunami's, bomb explosions, air-crash, etc. are other common instances where the problem of identification arises. Another important reason for non-identification of the dead body is the lack of interest by the police to properly work out the case.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many objects that we encounter have ‘typical’ material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft, and jell-O dessert is wobbly. Over a lifetime of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is, but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when pulled apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object’s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes “pulled” towards the “native” motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in response time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance.",

      "title": "Freedom as Moderator of the Personality-Mood Relationship",
      "abstract": "Abstract The striving for and experience of freedom are of central importance in human life. Our concern here is not freedom as a characteristic of a social (political) system or as a social value, but the experience of external and internal freedom in the natural surroundings of everyday life. There are situations that offer little restraint, in terms of both physical obstacles and social pressures. In such a situation a person experiences external freedom: If one wanted to, one could leave the situation or do something different within the situation without an effort to overcome physical obstacles and/or without being blamed (punished) by social agents. Thus, the concept of external freedom implies both being able and being allowed to do what one wants to do. There are, on the other hand, situations or activities that one can leave or change without acting against one’s personal norms, and feeling guilty. In this case we speak of internal freedom. In this sense, a person, even if experiencing an irresistible impulse to act in a certain way, is internally free to act if the desire is fully compatible with his or her values, that is, if he or she does not have to overcome anticipated feelings of guilt.",

      "abstract": "Universe is with a measure; the earth and the life on the earth is with a meas-ure.There is nothing at random; without measure, without rule. Perfection and health of the parts in that perfect system are interrelated. Whenever a corrup-tion/degeneration is commited by someone it affects others. Then it is neces-sary to take necessary measures. All the extreme actions, wastefully spending and using things at random which affect spiritual and material, personal and social/common life negatively and frustrate economic balances even more natu-rel balances were stated by the word “immoderation” (exceeding the proper bound) in the Qoranic language. “Immoderation”, as a subject and content, is a problem that have to be taken seriously and to be solved at the personal and social. Islam takes it seriously in general and in special and orders that it should be shunned. In general it considires all kinds of immoderation at the religious and worldly; spiritual and material levels. In its special meaning it means immoderations at financial areas. Islam orders that all immoderations in belief and in actions of worship and obedience and spiritual practices must be given up. It declares that eating, drinking, dressing and benefitting from all kinds of benefactions are lawful, but it’s necessary to give upall immoderations and Allah does not like immoderates.Islam which forbids all kinds of immodera-tion has found a special solution to it; it ordered “moderation” as a remedy for it. “Moderation” has also got some general meanings as well as narrow ones. In general it means to be temperate in all sorts of habits and actions; and in nar-row sense it means thriftiness in spending money etc. Qoran orders neither to be niggard as someone who “his hand was shackled to the neck” nor “to squander” to make the parent hungry and needy; but to be “just mean between those (two extremes)” and to be in the same way at spending on the others too. By applying the general meaning every thing will be kept on temperance in; material and spiritual life; physical, spiritual, material etc. abilities will be temperate. By the application of narrow meaning, necessities and enjoyments will be satisfied temperately and so, by using them usefully and in necessity, the material substances will be kept as an asset that everybody can use them. It is clear that the immoderation, extreme actions and wastefully spendings cause spiritual and material corraptions. The statistical informations about these subjects are neither pleasant for our country nor for rest of the world. To conclude, persons and communities have to endeavour to eliminate “immoderation” and make the “moderation” a life-style habit in its place. This is more useful for everybody and everything in the world.",

      "abstract": "A person's level of well‐being (or, equivalently, welfare or quality of life) is the extent to which things go well for her: the better a person's life is for her – i.e., the better things go for her – the higher she is in well‐being. How well things go for someone depends on whether, and to what extent, the things that happen in her life are good or bad for her. A theory of well‐being purports to tell us how to identify the things in a person's life that are basically good or bad for her – good or bad for her in their own right, and not merely on account of causing things that are good or bad for her (as money does), indicating such things (as the results of a blood test might), having such things as parts (as the person's entire life might), or being otherwise related to such things. Roughly speaking, an objective theory of well‐being is one that claims that something can be basically good for a person even if she has no favorable (or “pro‐”) attitude toward it or basically bad for her even if she has no disfavorable (or “con‐”) attitude toward it. Examples of objective theories include theories on which knowledge, moral virtue, or the exercise of distinctively human capacities is a basic good.",

A trauma is something that overwhelms the psyche in a more than momentary way arousing fear or even terror, often a fear of death and a sense that life is not worth living. Trauma interferes with the capacity to symbolise. The traumatised person loses a sense of there being a containing figure, internally or externally. Language gets its possibility and meaning from shared activities and practices. So to lose one's language is to lose a form of life. One aspect of the cultural trauma perpetrated on hunter-gather cultures has been the colonial attempt to obliterate local language speaking, for example in Canada when the policy was to remove native. As with individuals, a cultural traumatic event may be either what used to be called in insurance policy documents an \"Act of God\" or it may be more or less man-made.",

      "title": "Seeing illusory body movements in human causal interactions",
      "abstract": "Goal-directed actions entail causality. One person moving his limbs in a certain way causes another person to react, creating a meaningful interaction. For example, seeing a friend throwing a ball towards you causes you to raise your arm to catch it. If humans are sensitive to the causal relation between two individual actions, then one action may provide information about the causal history of a static frame of the other action: the causal actions that generated the posture change over time. The present study examined whether human causal interactions can induce a percept of gradual motion between two distinct postures. The stimuli involved an interactive action, with one actor throwing an object and another actor catching it. The object itself was not presented. On each trial, the thrower was shown first, followed by a brief presentation of the catcher, while the thrower continued his movements in the entire trial. During the brief presentation, the catcher demonstrated either a sudden posture change (two static posture frames) or a gradual posture change with smooth movements (multiple frames). The two actors either showed a meaningful interaction (i.e. they faced each other), or a non-interactive situation (i.e. they faced away), or were presented upside-down. Participants judged whether the catcher showed a sudden or gradual posture change. We found that in the interaction condition, the proportion of trials in which a sudden change was misidentified as a gradual change was significantly higher than in the non-interactive or the inverted conditions. This finding suggests that observers were more likely to perceive illusory gradual motions when body movements were consistent with a causal interpretation of two actors interacting to achieve a common goal. To account for the human results, a Bayesian model was developed that incorporated inferred expectations based on causal actions. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2017",

A victim of wrongdoing may be angry, afraid, hurt and resentful; as a result, the victim may feel violated. Perceived wrongs may also make a victim feel violated. One issue that victims often have difficulty in coming to terms with is why they were wronged. The question has to do with making sense of – that is, finding out the reason for – what happened to them. Those who already have low self-esteem (that is, a misplaced or diminished sense of self-regard, self-confidence and self-respect and an inaccurate perception of themselves as rational and relational human beings) may find it particularly difficult to forgive (Novitz 1998: 311–13) – or may ‘forgive’ all too easily out of a lack of self-respect. With some types of wrongdoing, the victim may feel that the wrongdoer is implicitly communicating that the victim is worthless, a ‘thing’ (not a person) to be abused at will. Being wronged can be a psychologically destructive experience for a person, and can have harmful effects on the lives of others and even on communities.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“Life is a stage with one entrance but many exits”\r\nWill Durant (1954).\r\nSuicide is a psychiatric issue by itself and is also associated with other\r\nPsychiatric illnesses. Though fatal outcomes in suicidal attempts are not seen in\r\nHospitals in our set up, other factors of rescue do play a part in hospital\r\nAttendance.\r\nSuicidal acts with non-fatal outcome are labeled suicide attempts,\r\nAttempted suicides, Parasuicide, or acts of deliberate self harm. These terms are\r\nUsed to describe behaviors, through which people inflict acute harm upon\r\nThemselves with a non fatal outcome. These behaviors are some how linked to,\r\nBut do not result in death.\r\nAccording to WHO/EURO multi-centre study on Para suicide, it is\r\nDefined as An act with non fatal outcome in which an individual deliberately\r\nInitiates a non habitual behavior, that without intervention from others will\r\nCause self harm, (or) deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the prescribed\r\n(or) generally recognized dosage, and which is aimed at realizing changes that\r\nThe person desires via the actual (or) expected physical consequences.\r\nHence, non- fatal suicidal attempts can have different motivations,\r\nVarying from an intention to die or a cry for help. These attempts may be well\r\nPrepared or carried out impulsively. The degree of lethality and the degree of\r\nMedical seriousness thus depend upon intention, preparation, knowledge and\r\nExpectations of the method chosen and sometimes upon coincidental factors,\r\nSuch as intervention from others.\r\nRisk and protective factors are associated with suicidal behaviors in\r\nYoung females, including stressful life events, mental disorders and hormonal\r\nFactors. Risk and protective factors suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms\r\nAnd indicate the need for efficient method to reach these people at risk.\r\nAs per the WHO statistics, in the year 2000, approximately one million\r\nPeople died from suicide: a mortality rate of 16 per 100,000, or one\r\nDeath every 40 seconds. In the last 45 years suicide rates have increased by 60%\r\nWorldwide.\r\nSuicide is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-\r\n44 years (both sexes); these figures do not include suicide attempts up to 20\r\nTimes more frequent than completed suicides. Suicide worldwide is estimated to\r\nRepresent 1.8% of the total global burden of disease in 1998, and 2.4% in\r\nCountries with market and former socialist economies in 2020. Although\r\nTraditionally suicide rates have been highest among the male elderly, rates\r\nAmong young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now\r\nThe group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and\r\nDeveloping countries.\r\nEttlingers (1964) in his review reports, 1-2% of those who attempt suicide\r\nEventually complete suicide annually. For every single successful suicidal\r\nAttempt 5-10 persons attempt but do not succeed.\r\nMental disorders (particularly depression and substance abuse) are\r\nAssociated with more than 90% of all cases of suicide; however, suicide results\r\nFrom many complex sociocultural factors and is more likely to occur\r\nParticularly during periods of socioeconomic, family and individual crisis\r\nSituations (e.g. Loss of a loved one, employment, honor).\r\nThough there were observations about suicide and suicidal\r\nBehavior in ancient times, the studies on attempted suicide and suicide have\r\nGained impetus in the recent past. Such studies have lent credence to the theory\r\nThat the suicidal state appears to a large extent, a potentially recognizable and\r\nPreventable one.\r\nDue to expansion of the problem of attempted suicide, major research\r\nEffort has been directed towards investigation on the characteristics of people\r\nWho attempt suicide and is given a high priority in suicide prevention. At risk\r\nPopulation for suicide and attempted suicide is a group which has to be\r\nIdentified and intervened to prevent death from this eminently preventable\r\nCause.\r\nThe aim is not only to achieve a fall in rate of suicide but also to\r\nRestore the individual’s mental health, the sources of emotional sustenance,\r\nWhich is necessary for survival and to maintain the dignity of human life.",

While primary emotions require a self to experience the state (Lewis and Michalson, 1983), self-conscious emotions require a self both to produce the state and then to experience it. For example, a loud noise may put me in a state of fright. But to experience this state, I need to be aware of my state of fright. To be in a state of shame I must compare my action against some standard, either my own or someone else's. My failure, relative to the standard, results in a state of shame. Once in the state, I may or may not experience it. To experience it depends on whether I focus my attention on my state. Again, this requires consciousness. Others have suggested that the state of shame can be produced in a more automatic fashion, one that does not require objective self-awareness.

      "abstract": "What is called physical torture comprises methods of producing severe pain. What is called psychological torture comprises methods to produce exhaustion, fear, anxiety, hopelessness, desperation, psychic disorganization, loss of control of mental states and acts, and extreme dependency. Physical torture aims to arouse intense fear. Psychological torture is the torture of the future, not only because it is “no marks” torture but also because its aim is different from physical torture and more radical. The victim is not simply reduced to impotence, helplessness, but to a state of ever-greater dependency on his or her torturer. We have to distinguish between informed and deliberate conversion of a detainee’s political convictions, through a kind of hard bargaining that appeals to the detainee’s rationality; inducing a detainee to betray his or her convictions and his or her community and bringing that about by deceit and deception; and inducing a detainee to betray his or her convictions and his or her community by the deliberate destruction of the detainee’s identity and sanity.",

      "title": "18Boosting State Humility via Gratitude, Self-Affirmation, and Awe: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Humility is a psychological characteristic marked by a balanced, accurate \nself-concept and pronounced focus on other people rather than oneself \n(Tangney, 2000). We propose that humility is characterized by five hallmarks, \nor observable markers: (a) a secure and accepting self-identity; (b) freedom \nfrom distortion about one’s strengths and weaknesses; (c) openness to new \ninformation about oneself and the world; (d) high focus on others relative to \nthe self; and (e) a belief that other people are equally worthy (Chancellor & \nLyubomirsky, 2013). Each hallmark must be present, but none is individually sufficient for a person to be humble. These hallmarks thus both define \nhumility and differentiate it from what it is not. In particular, the opposite of \nhumility is high self-focus, including an excessively positive (e.g., narcissism \nor arrogance) or negative (e.g., depression or low self-esteem) self-view. Further, under this hallmarks-based definition, humility can be distinguished from \nmodesty. Although humble people are frequently modest, they may sometimes \nbehave immodestly when speaking frankly about their genuine strengths and \naccomplishments. Additionally, narcissistic individuals may behave outwardly \nmodestly for self-presentational purposes while maintaining an inwardly inflated \nself-worth. As such, humility is neither merely the absence of arrogance nor the \npresence of modesty.",

So one has not fully learned about living like a rational and moral being unless one has learned to appreciate that one ought to do things out of regard for others, and not only out of regard for oneself. In the first place, not everything done for oneself is done for reasons of prudence. That one ought to insure one's house, save for one's old age, not put all one's money into one venture, are precepts of prudence.

However, I do not agree with Hulett(3) who says, \"It is indeed devastating to recognize as we must that all men are not possessed of manhood and that the yellow streak down the backs of some of our fellows is invisible to the unaided human eye,\" since I believe more frequently than not that the sufferer of the self-inflicted wound is neither a moral nor a physical coward. He may not agree with what is the accepted community goal. He does show determination and stamina in attaining his personal desire. We have here a man who after a milder form of malingering had failed attempted to produce the desired end by a self-inflicted wound. It is my impression that the man with the self-inflicted wound is a malingerer of the severest type. This act was not a suicidal gesture nor was it performed to obtain sympathy or compensation, but rather merely to obtain release from what was to him an uncomfortable and intolerable environmental situation. I believe that henceforth the definition of malingering with reference to the armed forces should stress the intentional production of disease in addition to exaggeration and simulation.",

      "abstract": "In the relevant circumstance of both relatively high burden or cost to others and low prospective gain for themselves, people have a prima facie duty to die sooner rather than later. This duty is a personal moral duty, not a \"societal\" duty, and thus, it in no way implies that others may demand that it be exercised. It is literally a duty to let death come, not a more general duty to die that encompasses active measures to ensure death. A person can owe this duty not only to close family and loved ones when they are heavily burdened, but in the right circumstances also to more distant persons, even to \"society\"; the fundamental reason is fairness to others in the society or insurance pool, given one's own evaluative preferences about trade-offs involving expensive, low-chance-of-benefit care. This personal moral duty to die does not extend to incompetent patients, at least not in any literal sense. The duty to die also does not jeopardize the marital vow, \"for better or worse, in sickness and in health\"; the creative and mutual relationship envisioned in a marital promise does not bar people from ever coming to think that they may be obligated to accept death because of effects on a spouse. Finally, although this duty is rooted in sensitivity to considerations of quality of life, it need not threaten the \"special\" value of individual life and lifesaving.",

Sickness is thought to be due to one of two causes: it may be, and the people think most frequently is, the result of magic which has been worked by some person who wishes to give pain or even to cause death because of a grievance, real or imaginary; or it may be due to some ghost. Under either circumstance, when a serious case of sickness occurs, the family seek the aid of a medicine-man who by his various tests and incantations discovers the cause; and, in a case where magic has been worked, he not only discovers the cause but also discloses the name of the culprit, who is thereupon sought and asked to give his motive for afflicting the sick person, and is paid to release him from the spell. Should the man have intended to kill the other because he has suffered some discourtesy or received some offence at his hands, he would probably have speared his shadow, so that the sick person will die unless the spell or magic is removed. Again, it may be that some magic has been worked and certain objects have been hidden near the house which are causing the sickness; these have to be removed and the spell broken before any drugs or treatment will avail the sick man. The perpetrator will only remove these when his grievance has been settled and he has received the needful compensation.",

I may not have thrown the baby into the river to drown and yet I can be blamed for not jumping in to save her for fear of getting my clothes wet. In such instances, “not doings” can be as violent as some doings. It is important, therefore, to take seriously the ontological status of absences, failures or omissions and to consider (for instance) “not attempting to save the drowning child” as having a distinct moral status. While not leaping to the rescue of the drowning child in our example, I may look the other way or walk away fast; and surely the acts of “looking away or walking fast” cannot be construed as violent. But even though the primary locus of moral evaluation may be the “negative action,” the positive acts (of looking away, of walking fast) become alibis by covering up for the omission. We have here not just “turning my head the other way” but of doing it “instead of attempting a rescue—a quite different matter.",

When the line of development from self-preservative aggression to the libidinalization of aggression progresses to the intensification of sadism, the psychic groundwork is laid for the use of sadism as a solution to neurotic or psychotic conflicts. When the mother's sadism fails to defend her against what she experiences as her child's persecution, she is at risk of relying upon ruthless aggression or its psychic equivalent. The child's wellbeing is then no longer relevant to the mother. The mother's only concern is negating or eliminating any aspect of the child that poses a threat to her survival.",

Again the monk appeared on his rung as before, saying: “O Judge, I ask you: Why do animals suffer disease, though they will not obtain eternal life nor have the use of reason?” 2 Second question. “Why is everything born in pain, though sin is not involved in every birth?” 3 Third question. “Why does an infant carry the sin of its father, though it does not know how to sin?” 4 Fourth question. “Why do unforeseen events happen so often?” 5 Fifth question. “Why does a bad person die in a good death like the righteous while a righteous person sometimes dies a bad death like the unrighteous?” 6 Answer to the first question. The Judge answered: “Friend, your questioning does not come from love; however I answer you for the love of others. You ask why animals suffer infirmities. 7 This is because there exists a disorder in them as in the rest of creation. I am the maker of every nature and have given to each its own temperament and order in which each one moves and lives. 8 However, after man, for whose sake all things were made, set himself against his lover,1Close that is, against me his God, then disorder entered all the rest of creation, and all the things that should have been afraid of man began to set themselves against him and oppose him. 9 Because of this defective disorder many troubles and difficulties befall humankind as well as animals. 10 Besides, sometimes animals also suffer because of their own natural immoderation or as a curb to their ferocity, or as a cleansing of nature itself, or sometimes because of human sins in order that human beings, who have a greater use of reason, might consider how much punishment they deserve, when the creatures they love are plagued and taken away. 11 But if human sins did not demand it, animals, which are under human charge, would not suffer in so singular a manner. But not even they suffer without great justice. 12 Their suffering occurs either to put a quicker end to their lives and lessen their wretched toils that consume their strength or on account of a change in seasons or out of human carelessness during the process of work. 13 People should therefore fear me, their God, above all things, and treat my creatures and animals more mildly, having mercy on them for the sake of me, their Creator. 14 I, God, accordingly decreed the Sabbath2Close rest, because I care for all my creation.”",

Only a tender soul is the store house of affection. A soul that has already been hardened seldom shows affection. Affection is guided by emotion. As such affection is a disease. It is one kind of mental state or a mental disposition. Thus it signifies a person’s natural qualities of mind and character. Mother is always affectionate but father may not be so. Indulgence is the state of being allowed whatever one wants. It overlooks faults. It is the action or habit of satisfying one’s own or other people’s desires. Indulgence allows oneself to enjoy the pleasure of something. It is to become involved in an activity, especially one that is illegal or disapproved of. It is to satisfy an interest, a desire, etc..Sacrament is any of several rituals in the Roman Catholic, Anglican and other Christian Churches through which Christians believe they are specially blessed by God. The sacrament of baptism is the striking example of it. Indulgence is the remission of unishment in purgatory, still due for sins even after sacramental absolution. Thus absolution is a formal declaration, especially in a Christian Church, by a priest that a person’s sins have been forgiven. Forgiveness is a great virtue. To forgive is divine. A sinner is rectified through pardon. Only a lucky soul can follow that immortal light.",

Panic Breakdown of ordered, cooperative behavior of individuals due to anxious reactions to a certain event. Often, panic is characterized by attempted escape of many individuals from a real or perceived threat in situations of a perceived struggle for survival, which may end up in trampling or crushing of people in a crowd.

Background Homebound persons have a significantly higher mortality risk as well as physical and psychosocial burden. A clarification of the term is necessary to develop preventive measures. Design Concept analysis. Data Sources Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Scopus) and definitions from online dictionaries. Review Methods Walker and Avant's method was applied to guide the concept analysis. To prevent arbitrary and empty results in determining the attributes, antecedents, and consequences a thematic analysis was carried out. Results Homebound is defined as an enduring condition in which the life-space is reduced to the home, but moving around in the home is possible (by walking short distances alone or by holding on to furniture, or with the help of a stick, walker, or another person). Homebound has six attributes: in need of help in ADL/IADL and in leaving the life-space, powerlessness, life-space confinement, mobility limitation, endurance, and weakness. Physiological instability and physical immobility are antecedents with wide-ranging influencing factors as illness, complexity, burden, and endogenous/exogenous booster. Homebound has also wide-ranging consequences such as the progression of inactivity, physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual problems. Conclusions The multidimensional concept of homebound modifies the concepts of mobility and immobility. Given the extensive consequences of homebound nurses play a central role in the prevention.",

      "abstract": "Pattern recognition is concerned with the classification or description by computer of objects, events, or other meaningful regularities in noisy or complex environments. As an area of computer science and engineering, pattern recognition is the study of concepts, algorithms, and implementations that provide artificial systems with a perceptual capability to put abstract objects, or patterns, into categories in a simple and reliable way. As a human experience, pattern recognition refers to a perceptual process in which patterns in any sensory modality (vision, hearing, touch, taste, or smell) or patterns in conceptual or logical thought processes are analyzed and recognized (or classified) as being familiar either in the sense of having been previously experienced or of being similar to or associated with a previous experience.",

      "title": "5 Object",
      "abstract": "Abstract Aquinas asserts on many occasions that human actions are specified by their objects. Two meanings he gives to the term ‘object’ are particularly significant. On some occasions, he uses ‘object’ to mean a thing in so far as it possesses a formal quality by which it defines a related action, habit, or power. To illustrate, as the colour of something (not its smell or taste) defines sight, so distinctive differences in what is willed determines whether human actions are morally good, evil, or indifferent, and whether they belong to more particular moral species such as almsgiving or adultery. On other occasions, Aquinas has a second meaning for ‘object’, namely, a proximate end. In this case, when he says an object specifies, he means that a proximate end (such as ‘taking an innocent life’) determines a moral species (such as ‘murder’), and that no further end an agent may pursue (such as wealth) is necessary to make this determination.",

The author recognized the other actions that contributing to the commission of suicide as provision of any help in the realization of person's intention to commit suicide that is after this intention has already arisen. The instigation to suicide and the other actions that contributing to the commission of suicide which from reasons beyond the person's volition didn't lead to suicide or attempted suicide should be considered as attempted assassination of incitement to suicide. If it is established that the cruel treatment of person, blackmail, systematic abasement of human dignity or systematic illicit constraint to commitment acts that adverse his volition, is committed with purpose to germinate victim's intention to commit suicide or attempted suicide, when in case of if the victim doesn't commit an act of suicide, the commission of this act should be considered as attempted assassination of incitement to suicide. If the cruel treatment of person, blackmail, systematic abasement of human dignity or systematic illicit constraint to commitment acts that ad-verse his volition, is committed by cо-perpetrators without purpose to germinate victim's intention to commit suicide or attempted suicide, then the persons who committed such acts are recognized as cо-perpetrators of incitement to suicide only if there has been consequence in the form of suicide or attempted suicide, and provided that such a consequence is treated with indirect intent.",

      "title": "Contempt: a hot feeling hidden under a cold jacket",
      "abstract": "Contempt is the feeling when one judges another person as an inferior human being, and is typically expressed through social exclusion. Feeling contempt thus implies rejecting others, considering others as unworthy of one’s attention. Contempt is often mixed with other emotions, such as anger, hatred, or socio-moral disgust. Often therefore, the expression of contempt can coincide with feelings of revenge or even attempts to attack the other person. I think contempt is a moral emotion, in that it is often elicited in response to transgressions that are considered as amoral. These include behaviors such as betrayal, theft, (sexual) violence, which go against our moral standards and therefore deserve only contempt. These types of transgressions are too awful to criticize, and therefore can only lead to rejection or exclusion. Although we may feel contempt towards people we hardly know, contempt often develops out of anger, especially when we have been confronted with others or other groups who have not changed their behavior in reaction to our anger. Anger therefore does not seem functional, and contempt emerges as a way of coping with the lack of influence or control we have over the other.",

      "abstract": "The great nineteenth century architect and renovator of ancient buildings, Viollet-le-Duc, maintained that the adoption of absolute principles, when thinking about the past and restoring those things handed down to us from the past, ‘could quickly lead to the absurd’ (Viollet-le-Duc 1854: loc. 6796). From the simple fact that some things that are important to us are so, at least in part, because they are old, many questions spring. Why should the fact that something has been around for a long time confer value on it? Should old things be preserved or should they be left to decay? Preservation, by suspending the aging process, undermines that very value it is designed to preserve. Decay, on the other hand, results in the objects vanishing altogether. Why do we queue to see original objects but are generally indifferent to perceptually identical facsimiles? How can we explain the cult of relics (or reliques)? Why are we indifferent to some old things (stones) but not to others (axe-heads)? Is the reconstruction of damaged or destroyed heritage a matter of fakery (‘Disney-fication’)? What do we even mean by terms such as ‘genuine’ and ‘authentic’? Even if we can throw light on the value conferred by age, how valuable is that value? Is it worth the vast amount of money absorbed by the heritage industry – especially in the face of other pressing needs such as food and shelter?",

      "abstract": "Throughout the history people have had a natural tendency to decorate their bodies and their clothing. It is as old as humanity and derives from variety of needs: the need to stand out, to demonstrate social status, gender, religion, etc. This common desire influenced the development of diverse ornament design techniques among which common guidelines could be drawn within processing and usage of similar materials and also the basic division of jewellery ornaments. Initially modest jewellery items were made of objects that man found in its home environment. The discovery of different kinds of metals triggered a massive technical revolution, which leads to many new design options. Jewellery production is one of the oldest forms of decorative art representing an important element within cultural heritage, which in addition to the esthetic aspect always carries a strong symbolic meaning. \r\nWhen designing jewellery there are numbers of morphological requirements related to the laws of the space cross, shape, volume, mass and art variables (e.g. size, weight, texture etc.) of ornaments and their basic function is to follow the human anatomy. With the help of formal art aspects, designers achieve various meanings and sensory properties of ornaments, which must also follow the aspect of functionality (e.g. the lock mechanism) and the personal comfort of the person wearing a certain piece of jewellery. \r\nThe practical part of this thesis presents the entire process of creating authentic silver jewellery. From the perspective of art aspects concerning rings made with lost wax casting technique, I have focused on the size and the surface texture of the ornament. \r\nThe educational section describes the education process - the preparation and conduct of the jewellery design workshops intended for adult amateur artists.",

      "title": "The value of animal life: how should we balance quality against quantity?",
      "abstract": "Abstract In many situations choices must be made that will have an impact on the welfare of companion animals. Often one of the options will be to euthanase the animal in question. The way in which one views this option will depend not only on one's assessment of the quality of the animal's life (or the lives of other affected parties), but also on how one values an animal life as such. Clearly, a companion animal may be valued by a human being or by another animal. A dog's death may affect its owner's quality of life (QoL), or it may affect the QoL of other animals in the household. But does the life of an animal have any value other than that? Is anything lost, for example, when a dog that lived with a sole owner, now deceased, is euthanased? Conversely, would anything be gained if the dog were re-homed (apart from the potentially positive contribution to the new owners' QoL)? More generally, in prolonging, or refraining from ending, the life of an animal, is it thereby ensured that something of value persists? There seem to be three main views on this matter. The first is that animal life has no value in itself. The second is that animal life has value to the extent that the life in question is worth living for the animal. The third view is that the life of an animal has a value that exceeds what is ‘in it’ for the animal in question. The view one accepts here will have a dramatic impact on one's attitude to many of the choices to be made about the treatment of companion animals — choices in which one must balance quality of life against, as it were, quantity of life. So the heart of the matter is not only quality of life. It is also value of life. Unfortunately it may prove much more difficult to agree about the value of animal life than it is to agree about the significance of animal welfare.",

      "title": "Modern Applications of Hibah in the Light of Shari'ah Objectives of Gift and Donation Contracts (Al-Tabarru'at)",
      "abstract": "TABARRU'AT (GIFTS AND CHARITABLE ACTS) The term tabarru' (pl. tabarru'at) is derived from the root b-r-', meaning excel. For instance, He excelled in knowledge, courage, or other qualities; or excelled his companions in knowledge; or was, or became accomplished; perfect or complete, in every excellence, and in goodness. (1) Tabarru' bil-'ata' means, he gave what was not incumbent or obligatory on him; gave supererogatorily; or gave gratuitously, unasked, or unbidden. The jurists, taking into consideration the basic linguistic meanings and the essence projected by wasiyyah, waqf, hibah, 'ariyah, qard and other similar contracts derive the technical meaning of tabarru' as, contract which extends wealth or its benefit to others, immediately or in the future, without desiring a compensation and with the intention of doing a pious deed (bi qasd al-birr wal-ma'ruf). This definition presents tabarru' contract as the genus and places wassiyah, waqf, and the like as its sub-contracts (anwa'). Tabarru'at, inclusive of its sub-contracts, are acts of piety and charity. (2) This is grounded in Q 5: 2: Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancor: Fear Allah. For Allah is strict in punishment. The Qur'an commentator, al-Jassas al-Razi (d. 369/980) elaborates: The verse enjoins every Muslim to support another in all types of acts which come under piety. (3) Acts of charity that support each other either in kind or cash or in any other form of benefit are part and parcel of piety. Another verse (Q 2:180) states: It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if leave any goods, that make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God-fearing. Even though the verse is specifically on the topic of bequest (wassiyah), it sheds light on the essence of tabarru'at. The verse encourages the dying person to consider his or her parents and next of kin in the spirit of love. The person is advised to allocate certain amount for parents and next of kin from his or her property without asking for anything in return. The spirit in tabarru'at is to share wealth and benefit others because of love and not because of personal gain. Tabarru'at is about caring for each other. Another verse of the Qur'an emphasizes that righteousness is not about performing salutary regulations only, but it is also about caring for each other. With the salutary regulations, a righteous man should strive for love of Allah and the love for his fellow-men: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards east or west; but it is righteousness to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God-fearing. (4) In this verse, extending assistance to kin, orphans, needy, wayfarer, beggars, and slaves are all considered as acts of piety, providing that the assistance rendered should proceed from love and no other motive. Hadiths also shed light on the importance of tabarru'at. Jurists present tahaddu tahhabbu (exchange gifts so that you may love one another) (5) as the principle source on which the legality of Hibah is based. This hadith touches upon the essence of tabarru'at, which is to give gifts to friends and relatives out of love. The legality of tabarru'at is established through consensus as well; the Muslim ummah agree on it to be a pious act. (6) In order to perform acts of tabarru'at as a contract, a Muslim has to deal with its components (arkan). …",

This latter is a necessary idleness and useful insofar as society expands and the administration of public affairs contracts. By parasitism I mean that kind of inactivity which contributes neither labour nor wealth to society, which accumulates without ever losing, and which the masses regard with foolish admiration and the wise with scornful compassion for those victims who fall into its clutches and who lacking that drive towards an active life which is given by the necessity of caring for or increasing the requisites of life, let all their energies drift at the mercy of the passions of opinion, which are not the weakest of passions. We cannot call someone a social parasite who enjoys the fruits of his own forefathers' virtues or vices and who, in return for his temporary pleasures, dispenses bread and a livelihood to the industrious poor, and who wages by means of his wealth the silent war of trade in peacetime, rather than waging with force the uncertain and bloody sort of war.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People might mistakenly believe that they have another person’s consent when they do not. People might send signals that others reasonably interpret as conveying consent, when none was intended. Who should bear the costs of such mistakes? It should be the person who caused the mistake to be made (if they did so deliberately or out of culpable negligence). It should be the person who made the mistake (if out of culpable negligence or culpable ignorance). Sometimes we may hold people strictly liable for violating a person’s rights (to bodily integrity, e.g.) without their consent, even if they mistakenly believed they had it. Someone who knowingly takes advantage of another person’s mistake about consent should bear its burdens. In cases of innocent error, we might let the burdens ‘lie where they fall’ or, alternatively, allocate the burdens to the party best able to bear them.",

      "abstract": "The legal status of an organ, in the period between its extraction from the body of a donor and its implantation in the body of a recipient, is unclear. In that period, the excised organ might be said to be orphaned because of its ambiguous custodial and proprietary status, and a host of activities might take place which could jeopardise its safety or viability for transplantation. For instance, what happens if the organ was lost or damaged in transit? Not inconceivably, a thief might snatch the organ from the possession of the transplant team; a transplant surgeon could use the organ for the treatment of their relative or close friend, a celebrity, or an influential political figure, instead of transplanting the organ into the properly selected and designated recipient contrary to the established allocation criteria. The excised organ might be damaged maliciously by a third party, say, an enemy of the proposed recipient who was bent on frustrating the recipient’s only means of receiving a life-saving treatment. Further, a live donor might change their mind on donation to the potential recipient after the organ has already been extracted. While these scenarios raise an interesting mix of legal, ethical, political and social questions, a fundamental enquiry that permeates the whole gamut of issues engendered by the hypothetical above is the question of ownership and proprietary entitlement to an excised (orphaned) organ. Accordingly, this article interrogates the question of proprietary control or ownership of an orphaned organ.",

      "title": "Self-Transcendence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Self-transcendence is the process by which a person becomes aware of their participation in something greater than their individual self. The conscious realization of participation in something beyond yourself, such as union with nature, humanity, or God, evokes positive emotions, particularly joy and awe, which are often combined with attitudes of humility and reverence. The cultivation of self-transcendence provides a coherent perspective on living that promotes physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. If we accept that virtue involves respect for the dignity of others and not just one’s individual self, then the cultivation of self-transcendence is essential to all aspects of virtue. In this chapter, we provide several lines of empirical evidence about human nature, ecological systems, well-being, and virtue that provide a solid foundation to guide clinical practice in promoting health. Prospective studies indicate that the cultivation of self-transcendence and well-being involves the dynamic interplay of three processes: the awakening of plasticity (i.e., being able and willing to change); virtue (i.e., having intuitive insight into what is good for a person’s self and others); and creative functioning (i.e., being innovative, purposeful and responsible so that our habits are congruent with our goals and values). The cultivation of self-transcendence by these three processes describes the essential features of the path to a life that is healthy, happy, and good. We describe evidence-based practices that are effective in motivating people to create opportunities for their own well-being and that of others by cultivating self-transcendence.",

      "title": "Problems of Corporate Culture",
      "abstract": "Abstract If respect for autonomy is a moral requirement, then it is good, other things being equal, to permit people to do what they want to do. Other things are not equal in an organization, which almost by definition creates relationships that entail obligations and other limits on autonomy, but organizations can also increase one’s autonomy, which in any case remains an important moral consideration. Autonomy is not simply a matter of doing what one wants: if it were, then the weak-willed person, the addict, and the victim of brainwashing would all be autonomous. The threat to autonomy in the organization comes in part from the organization’s power to compel people to do what they do not want to do and have no legitimate obligation to do and also from people’s doing exactly what they want to do; people may act on desires they prefer not to have or would prefer not to have if they thought about them. Chapter 5 argued that to do what one wants to do when one wants to do something that is not the object of a rational desire is to act less than fully autonomously. The distinction between first-order and second-order desires provides us with an insight into human motivation but does not by itself enable us to distinguish between autonomous desires and others, since second order desires too may result from addiction or brainwashing. If an organization affects Smith’s second-order desires in a way that serves the interests of the stockholders or managers but not of Smith, then we surely have some reason to say that her autonomy has been violated. Defining autonomy, Chapter 5 showed, is a difficult philosophical problem; there is a practical difficulty, too, for the manager who wants to do what every manager has a moral obligation to do, which is to manage an organization that respects autonomy in a way that is consistent with effectively achieving legitimate corporate objectives.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of violent radicalism/extremism is portrayed as a consequence of a mechanism that fosters extremism in general. This is the process of motivational imbalance or “prepossession”, a state wherein a given need becomes dominant to the point of inhibiting other needs. In the case of violent extremism, the dominant need is the quest for significance, the desire to matter and have self and others’ respect. Whereas the “hydraulic” domination-inhibition process that underlies extremism can be observed across levels of phylogeny, the motivational imbalance in those cases is typically brief in duration. In the case of humans, however, participation in violent extremism can be long lasting, due to its facilitation by a compelling narrative” that ties violence to the attainment of significance, and is embraced by a “network” of trusted others (individuals’ friends and relatives) who validate the narrative and bestow significance on individuals who implement its dictates.",

As a result, a character fights against the fatal forces or loses his/her will - falls without unconscious (the most frequent reaction), begs for mercy or runs away.

      "abstract": "In the course of 25 years we examined 103 arsonists psychiatrically. In 10 of these cases the firesetting was accompanied by a suicidal attempt, or was inspired by a suicidal motive. These arsonists differ from arsonists with other motives: typically suicidal arsonists are older, have a higher share of women, higher values of psychosocial burden, and different psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, the fire ist set mainly in the own flat, revenge is seen much more frequently as an accompanying motive, and, typically, suicidally motivated arsonists do set only one single fire. Out of our 10 arsonists, 5 originally had intended to die in the flames but then ran away exasperated or were saved; this combination is termed \"self-immolation\" in older papers. We suggest the term \"suicide in combination with firesetting\" for cases, where, after having set a fire, the arsonist tries to commit suicide at a different place and with other means than fire. In 7 cases we found the motive of extended suicide, with taking along the own property; in 2 cases, along with the suicide, also intimates were intended to put to dead. One female arsonist was saved out of the fire and then, after being discharged from the hospital, tried to kill her unfaithful friend. About one half of the suicidally motivated firesetters was alcoholized at the time of their firesetting while 70% of the arsonists with other motives were alcoholized, 4 of the suicidal arsonists were alcoholics altogether, similar to the whole group of arsonists, from which, approximately, one half are alcoholics.",

These specialists have at their disposal a wide array of sophisticated rituals serving one or more of the following purposes: (1) protection, (2) purification of negative deeds, (3) increase of merit, (4) elimination of obstacles, (5) fulfillment of wishes, (6) long life or prolonging of the life span, (7) health and (8) enhancement of the healing power of medicine. Astrological calculations to determine propitious stellar configurations also play a role in the elimination of obstacles, allowing one to carefully choose the day and time to set out on a journey, to marry, to start a new business, and so forth. Tibetans believe that every twelfth year in one’s life, when the animal sign of one’s birth year reoccurs, is an obstacle-year (lo keg). One is advised to avoid any risky undertakings during that year, and before the beginning of the year one visits a lama who may advise one to go on a pilgrimage, or to have certain rituals—like the tsetar (tshe thar) or “liberation of the lives of animals”—performed.",

      "abstract": "All animals regularly encounter events that recruit attention and a vigilant posture because the stimuli share some features with similar events encountered in the past. Some animals typically approach these discrepant events, whereas others typically avoid them. This fact became a fundamental principle for Schneirla,1 who spent much of his career trying to understand ap proach-avoidant behavior in ani mals. There are at least three differ ent questions one can ask about these complementary reactions to unfamiliar events. One line of inquiry seeks to de termine, within or between species, which events consistently elicit ap proach and which avoidance. The sight of the mother usually provokes the former in mammalian infants; the sight of an unfamiliar adult typi cally provokes an initial avoidance. A second question asks about inter specific differences in approach or avoidance to the same class of events. One-year-old macaque monkeys avoid, at least initially, an unfamiliar monkey of the same age, whereas 3-year-old children (roughly comparable to 1-year-old monkeys because the macaque grows at a rate three times that of the human) more often approach an un familiar peer. Finally, one can ask about intraspecific differences in the tendency to approach or to avoid",

The third is a general energy field or atmosphere in which the person grows up and which is offensive enough to that person's sensitiveness and sensibilities to be brutalizing. The therapy of terror is a contact sport, but the contact must be caring, loving, as a friend. The terrorized patient must be kept in contact with his or her avoidance of excitement when in the phobic layer until implosion and trembling explosion occurs, not once but repeatedly, until the basic organismic resiliency is restored.

      "title": "On Huizinga's Theory of Play",
      "abstract": "The play that Huizinga had discussed was mainly that of social one namely, game. He argued that we should take hold of play by the way of characteristics—describing. The characteristics of play that he had described were mainly as follows: (1) Voluntary or free. Play is a kind of life-activity that is free in the meaning of ″voluntary″. (2) Dummy or of pretending to believe, of internal purpose and of non-material benefits. Play is a kind of dummy activity that organisms pretend to believe it as true and treat it seriously. In the playtime, organisms take the activity itself as the internal purpose, and do not seek for external material benefits. Therefore, play is a kind of activity that is of non-material benefits. (3) Obstructed. People play in particular time and space and with the abidance of particular rules that differ from that of realistic activities, which make play have a kind of insulation opposite to realistic activities. (4) The absoluteness or authority of the rules of games and the beauty-appreciatability of the forms of games. The rules are the necessary conditions for collective activities. For the games' going in gear, the rules of games must be valid generally or absolutely to all participants. Games in ideal conditions have the high orders, and therefore have the beauty-appreciatability of the forms of games. Tally up the above-mentioned characteristics of play, we can express Huizinga's basic viewpoint of play as follows: Play is a kind of dummy activity in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose and therefore do not seek for external benefits. In the characteristics that Huizinga had described, the purpose's internality of the activity is most fundamental. Seizing this fundamental characteristic, we can briefly recapitulate Huizinga's viewpoint of play as follows: Play is a kind of life-activity in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose. This is just Huizinga's viewpoint of play on the theory of internal purpose. There were actually several concepts of play at different levels from wide sense to narrow sense in Huizinga's mind: play in the wide sense refers to all dummy activities in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose (including individual play and collective play); play in the middle sense refers to collective play—social game played by people in particular time and space (for leisure) and according to particular rules; and play in the narrow sense refers to competitive game—collective play with the characteristic of competition in which people aim at the satisfaction of the demand of pursuing superiority and other related mental demands. In discussing the relationship between mankind's culture and play, what Huizinga called (″play″) only refers to competitive game actually. Huizinga's play theory is mainly that about collective play, especially, about competitive game. The applicability of his play theory was waiting to be documented further. His theory of internal purpose about play—taking (the activity) itself as the purpose—contains the logic error of confusing means with purpose, therefore, his linguistic expression for the theory is not accurate.",

The nub of the offensiveness in the “profound” cases is not personal resentment over a disagreeable experience, but outrage at the offending conduct on grounds quite independent of its effect on oneself. Examples of profound offenses include voyeurism, Nazis and Klansmen, execrated but “harmless” deviant religious moral practices, desecration of venerated symbols, and abortion and mistreatment of corpses. The offense principle does not warrant legal interference in a person’s private conduct on the grounds that those who know that the conduct is (or may be) taking place need protection from the profound offensiveness of their own bare knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The classifying subjects who classify the properties and practices of others, or their own, are also classifiable objects which classify themselves (in the eyes of others) by appropriating practices and properties that are already classified (as vulgar or distinguished, high or low, heavy or light etc.—in other words, in the last analysis, as popular or bourgeois) according to their probable distribution between groups that are themselves classified. The most classifying and best classified of these properties are, of course, those which are overtly designated to function as signs of distinction or marks of infamy, stigmata, especially the names and titles expressing class membership whose intersection defines social identity at any given time—the name of a nation, a region, an ethnic group, a family name, the name of an occupation, an educational qualification, honorific titles and so on. Those who classify themselves or others, by appropriating or classifying practices or properties that are classified and classifying, cannot be unaware that, through distinctive objects or practices in which their ‘powers’ are expressed and which, being appropriated by and appropriate to classes, classify those who appropriate them, they classify themselves in the eyes of other classifying (but also classifiable) subjects, endowed with classificatory schemes analogous to those which enable them more or less adequately to anticipate their own classification.",

      "abstract": "Metaphors of the evil eye ( sahir ) are interpreted as posing a threat to the Muslim Arab Rubāṭāb 1 of the Sudan. A common situation in which these metaphors are used is when the speaker (saḥḥār) attempts to cast or “shoot” a sahir metaphor at persons or objects by comparing them to something else. A victim may then try to counteract the shot by uttering protective invocations. The victim's later account of the event in which the evil eye was cast upon him will include subsequent misfortunes and perhaps justifications for personal failure. For example, a sahhār likened someone eating a green onion to somebody speaking into a microphone. The man threw away the onion, cursed the sahhār , and complained thereafter that his hand had never been the same. The audience evaluates the metaphors. Good comparisons evoke much laughter. “He is really evil,” or “He killed him,” are often pronounced by the audience both in appreciation of the theoretical powers of the metaphor shooter and in anticipation of the harm that may come in the shot's wake. The audience later reports the interaction as a joke or legend.",

A pensive man stands to the right, cut by the frame (we see only a profile of a head, a hand with a cigarette, a bit of a shoe); a wicker chair is turned to the corner; and a male leg extends from the left wall. Trousered, shod, and cut below the knee, it is inexplicable. The man peers at the leg. Does he investigate a crime or revisit a deed of his own, ponder a work of art or hallucinate a body part? Is he the witness of the event? Its perpetrator? Its victim? Or is he somehow all three? Clearly the man is a voyeur; but, if the leg is somehow his, is he not an exhibitionist as well? To gaze so seems a little sadistic; yet, if this humiliated leg is somehow his, is he not a little masochistic too? This ambivalence of active and passive roles is performed in visual terms: both an active seeing and a passive being-seen are in play here, and they meet in a reflexive seeing oneself.1 The man is Robert Gober in 1991, and this is the uncanny thing about his art: before it or (more exactly) within it, one has the strange sense of seeing oneself, of revisiting the crime that is oneself. Exhibit B is drawn from an interview in 1990/93. Asked about his way of working, Gober replies: It's more a nursing of an image that haunts me and letting it sit and breed in my mind, and then, if it's resonant, I'll try to figure out formally, could this be an interesting sculpture to look at?

      "title": "Defining One's Own Concept of Existence and the Meaning of the Universe: The Presumption of Liberty in Lawrence v. Texas",
      "abstract": "The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good, in our own way, so long as we do not attempt deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other live as seems good themselves, than by compelling each live as seems good the rest. . . .1 Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.2 I. INTRODUCTION The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas,3 the landmark 2003 ruling overturning a Texas statute criminalizing homosexual sodomy, strikes at the very heart of a debate that has been raging in academic and political circles ever since the Court's revival of substantive due process in Griswold v. Connecticut.4 The crux of the debate focuses on a question primal political theory: if an expansive understanding is be given the right of the individual to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life,5 what legitimate role is left for the state declare moral limitations upon the definitions individuals choose? This note argues that Lawrence stands for a presumption of liberty protecting the private acts of individuals under the Due Process Clause. Simply put, this means that if the government fails show that its restrictions on individual exercises of liberty are not necessary and proper regulations of behavior harmful others, the mere claim that the government is upholding morality grounded in history or traditions should not justify such restrictions on liberty. This reading of Lawrence recognizes the Court's decision both as a victory for a more sound adjudication of substantive due process claims and as an accurate understanding of the libertarian underpinnings of American constitutionalism. Far from the fears of the dissent, Lawrence does not signal the end of morality in the law, but rather it recasts morality in terms that are palatable both contemporary intuitions of what liberty means and a classical understanding of the role of the individual in liberal democracy. In the final analysis, Lawrence is best seen as a substantial victory for the right of all Americans define their own concepts of meaning and value in matters fundamental how individuals constitute their very existence. Part II of this note gives an overview of the Court's substantive due process jurisprudence in order give context Lawrence's potential reach beyond sexual autonomy cases. Part III analyzes the Court's opinion in Lawrence, focusing on Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion and Justice Antonin Scalia's dissenting opinion. Part IV offers a particular interpretation of the majority opinion, arguing that Lawrence is nothing less than a watershed moment both for a renewed soundness in constitutional jurisprudence, and for the revival of libertarian values that have far too long been ignored by the Court. This part argues that Lawrence can and should be read as ushering in a presumption of liberty in subsequent cases brought before the Court. This part also offers a rejoinder the principal arguments of Justice Scalia's dissent, relying on the writings of Joel Feinberg argue that Scalia's most sweeping claims are misplaced or incorrect because they fail grasp the proper limits of legal moralism. Part V offers a short conclusion. …",

      "title": "Wear and Tear - Mechanical",
      "abstract": "The focus of this chapter is on the long term wear and tear, or aging, of the mechanical subsystem of a spacecraft. The mechanical subsystem is herein considered to be the primary support structure (as in a skeleton or exoskeleton) upon which all other spacecraft systems rest, and the associated mechanisms. Mechanisms are devices which have some component that moves at least once, in response to some type of passive or active control system. For the structure, aging may proceed as a gradual degradation of mechanical properties and/or function, possibly leading to complete structural failure over an extended period of time. However, over the 50 years of the Space Age such failures appear to be unusual. In contrast, failures for mechanisms are much more frequent and may have a very serious effect on mission performance. Just as on Earth, all moving devices are subject to normal (and possibly accelerated) degradation from mechanical wear due to loss or breakdown of lubricant, misalignment, temperature cycling effects, improper design/selection of materials, fatigue, and a variety of other effects. In space, such environmental factors as severe temperature swings (possibly 100's of degrees C while going in and out of direct solar exposure), hard vacuum, micrometeoroids, wear from operation in a dusty or contaminated environment, and materials degradation from radiation can be much worse. In addition, there are some ground handling issues such as humidity, long term storage, and ground transport which may be of concern. This chapter addresses the elements of the mechanical subsystem subject to wear, and identifies possible causes. The potential impact of such degradation is addressed, albeit with the recognition that the impact of such wear often depends on when it occurs and on what specific components. Most structural elements of the mechanical system typically are conservatively designed (often to a safety factor of greater than approximately 1.25 on yield for unmanned spacecraft) but do not have backup structure due to the added mass this would impose, and also due to the fact that structural elements can be accurately modeled mathematically and in test. Critical mechanisms or devices may have backups, or alternate work-arounds, since characterization of these systems in a 1g environment is less accurate than structure, and repair in-space is often impossible.",

More importantly, in the cases that require Chhedana (incising), Bhedana (excising) and Lekhana (scraping), the concept of Kshara (alkalis or alkaline preparations) given by Acharya Sushruta is of great importance than surgical instruments and appliances (both principal and secondary or substitutive); as they possess of the virtue of subduing the three deranged bodily humors namely Vata, Pitta and Kapha. 1These alkalis or alkaline preparations are termed as ‘Kshara’ based on their property of corroding (the skin or the flesh of an affected part of the body), or on their peculiar quality in destroying the skin and flesh where such an effect is desired.2Besides numerating eight commendable good qualities of an alkali viz.,being Na ati tikshna (neither too strong) Na ati mridu (nor too mild), Na ati shukla (white in colour), Shlakshna (smooth), Pichhila (slimy), Avishyandi (not spreading), Shiva (stable), Shighra (acting well and quickly)3 ; Acharya Sushruta has also mentioned its Dosha (adverse effects) which consist in its being Ati mridu (too mild), Ati shweta (of excessive whiteness), Ati ushna (excessive heat producing), Ati tikshna (of excessive strength), Ati pichhila (of over- sliminess), Ati sarpita (greatly spreading), Ati sandra (excessive thickness), Apakva (not well cooked) and Hinadravya (lacking in drugs).4",

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk untuk mengetahui bagaimana bentuk kesalahan pada delik pembunuhan, delik penganiayaan yang menyebabkan kematian dan delik karena kealpaannya menyebabkan kematian.Penelitian. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa Delik Pembunuhan bentuk kesengajaan dapat saja terjadi dalam tiga bentuk yakni sengaja sebagai niat, sengaja insyaf akan kepastian maupun sengaja insyaf akan kemungkinan karena perbuatan (apapun bentuknya) dari sipelaku memang dikehendakinya dan akibat yang akan ditimbulkan sudah. Sedangkan Delik Penganiayaan yang menyebabkan kematian jelas sekali bahwa bentuk kesalahan yang harus dilakukan oleh seorang pelaku adalah kesalahan dalam bentuk kesengajaan, dimana unsur sengaja dimaksud ditujukan pada perbuatan membuat rasa sakit, tidak enak pada tubuh atau luka pada tubuh, selanjutnya akibat dari perbuatan dimaksud menimbulkan kematian lain persoalan. Jika dilihat dari sifat kesengajaan maka bentuk kesengajaan yang pertama yang paling tepat, yaitu: sengaja sebagai maksud (opzet als oogmeenrk) atau disebut juga dollus directus. Sementara Delik karena kelalaian menyebabkan kematian mempersyaratkan adanya kealpaan yang bermakna adanya ketelodoran atau kecerobohan, dalam delik ini juga seseorang mestinya harus membayangkan, tetapi karena kelalaiannya tidak membayangkan sehingga terjadi akibat yang tidak dikehendaki",

      "abstract": "If a hungry, thirsty, itchy person eats some food, or drinks some water, or intentionally scratches an itch, this is individual action. That is, it is the intentional behaviour of an ordinary individual human person; other human beings are not necessarily involved. If a person takes a walk down the road by herself for exercise, or eats an ice cream for pleasure, or takes a shower on a hot day, this is also individual action. Such action is not action in cooperation with, or necessarily directed at, other individuals. On the other hand, if an individual kicks or throws a football to a teammate in the course of a game of football, or puts a motion forward at a committee meeting, then this is social action. Most human action is in fact at some level, or to some extent, or in some sense, social action. Even these actions of eating, drinking, eating ice cream, individually walking down the road, or having a shower typically presuppose social forms or objects, such as farms, ice cream parlours, cups, roads, and shower rooms. But the de facto presupposition of social forms does not of itself vitiate the distinction between individual and social action. More generally, the sociality of most human action does not vitiate the distinction; it merely serves to illustrate the need to develop a more elaborate set of distinctions in this area. There is nothing to be gained from insisting that no actions are individual and/or that all actions are social, just because it might in fact be that all the actions of human beings connect in some way, however indirectly, with the actions of other human beings and with social forms and social objects.",

There are fourteen varieties of superstitious works based on a division of divination into three kinds. The first variety takes place through the open invocation of demons, the second merely through the silent observation of the arrangement or motion of objects like constellations, days, winds and the like, and the third through the observation of some human action for the purpose of inquiring about something hidden. All these kinds have the designation “fortunes.” The varieties of the first kind of divination, the one that takes place through the explicit invocation of demons, are conjuring, divination by dreams, divination by the dead, Pythian divination, divination by earth, divination by water, divination by air, divination by fire and the religious practice of soothsayers (Thomas in Second of Second, Q. 95 [95.3.Co.] and 26, Q. 4, “Igitur” and Q. 5, “Nec mirum”). Next, the varieties of the second kind are horoscope casters, haruspices, augurs, omen watchers, diviners by hand and diviners by shoulder bone. The varieties of the third kind differ according to all those things that have the designation “fortunes” for the purpose of inquiring about something Part I 78A–C hidden, namely divination by the observation of dots, straws and congealed shapes in lead.

      "title": "The Peculiar Temporality of Violence: a Source of Perplexity about Social Power",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most national myths of origin begin with some transcendent or sacrificial story of violent revolution, warfare or liberation. This is also true of many origin myths of ethnic, tribal or other forms of social identity. This makes it appear that some act of violence is the cause of their coming into being. This paper argues that this is an artefact of the temporal 'peculiarity' of violence. Violent events, it is argued, are essentially unpredictable even when statistically probable. This means that violence is only 'visible' after the fact, and rarely before and that plausible causal models can rarely be constructed in advance. Violence is always seen in retrospect, then, and where it has caused significant death and destruction, it requires that we begin to make sense of what caused it. Unlike other planned or and emotionally charged social interactions (such as eating, sexuality, ritual) acts of violence interrupt (disrupt, breach, rupture, break, etc.) and terminate parts or all of previous social relations. Since the cause of violence can only be assigned retrospectively, this means that we must (re-)construct the past in a way that allows us to make sense of it. Where some violent event is followed by the eventual emergence of a new identity, the new identity is often explained as having 'originated' in violence. This implies that violence caused the new social identity in some way, and that it functions as a political instrument. But violence can only create a void, and is chaotic. After violence, we require the (re-)telling of the past in a new way. This makes violence appear at the beginning of narratives of origin, but does not imply that violence caused these identities. Since large scale violence leads cultural loss and to large scale social (re)construction, narratives of identity tend to begin at these moments in time. This account of violence seeks, therefore, to undermine the notion that violence is an efficient or final cause of social forms.",

      "abstract": "Moral status is a characteristic that we human moral agents attribute to entities, by virtue of which they matter morally for their own sake, so that we must pay attention to their interests or integrity when we consider actions that might affect them, regardless of whether other beings are concerned about them. When an entity has moral status, I may not act toward it in any way I please, disregarding its well-being, preferences, or continued existence. I owe some moral obligations to that entity itself. As a moral agent, I must care to some degree about what it wants or needs, or simply what it is; this imposes some limitations on how I may act toward it. This is importantly different from having obligations in relation to some entity (e.g., my neighbor's house) that are actually owed to some other entity (i.e., my neighbor). It is the being to whom duties are owed that has moral status. Moral status is also importantly different from moral goodness; persons' intentional conformity to moral principles might be one of the characteristics that enhances their moral status, relative to persons who routinely act immorally and to beings who are incapable of moral action, but being worthy of consideration in others' moral reasoning is quite distinct conceptually from acting morally oneself.",

These common experiences provide good opportunities to learn about the concept of inertia (and to obey the law and wear seatbelts!). The state of motion of the rider does not change until an outside force is applied.

In close relationships, we voluntarily make ourselves most vulnerable to another human being by linking the realization of our needs, aspirations, and hopes to the goodwill of our relationship partner (for related ideas, see chap. 17, this volume). Rendering ourselves vulnerable makes possible the profound sense of well-being that can be experienced in close relationships. But at the same time, the imperfection of any partner means that hurt or injury is virtually inevitable, and when it occurs, the hurt is particularly poignant precisely because we have made ourselves vulnerable. In the face of such injury, negative feelings (e.g, anger, resentment, disappointment) are common. Motivation to avoid the source of the harm,",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter suggests that hate is best understood through the lens of motivation: Hate is simply wanting a target to experience harm. Hate is often seen as “evil,” especially when manifesting as hate speech or hate crimes. Because people generally do not want to be seen as evil, haters are often reluctant to own the experience unless they can justify it—by labeling the target “evil,” for example. Hate that cannot be justified is sometimes disguised, as when intimate partner violence, stalking, and other mate retention tactics are labeled “jealousy” or even “love” by perpetrators (and sometimes victims). Whether disguised, or fleeting, or a means to some other end such as revenge or the temporary quashing of fear of abandonment, the desire for harm to befall another qualifies as hate.",

To identify is to allow discrimination – friend or foe? – the former classification being non–dangerous (potentially unharmful), the latter classification being dangerous (potentially harmful). For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non–alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would lead to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe).",

Elements of this aspect of traditional wisdom can be gathered through analytical studies of the ethnic societies, which are less influenced by the modern civilization, and also by scrutinizing the ancient texts written in Sanskrit, Pali, Tamil, etc. The Visnu Samhitā is one such scripture in Sanskrit language. It appears that this work contains some direct instructions in connection with conservation of the biodiversity. These commands are interspersed along with others in different chapters. The same have been collected and recorded together under appropriate heads. The same have been compared with similar information found in some other Sanskrit works with a view to tracing the possible course of evolution of the traditional approach. According to the text of the Visnu Samhitā, causing any harm to the plant(s) or animal(s) is a sin. Even purloining of part(s)/product(s) of any of these living beings is a crime. The sinner/criminal is liable to chastisement in this life and also after death. The punishments are of diverse nature –– pecuniary, corporal, expiatory, and donation of specific article(s) to a Brahmin. In this scripture there are some indirect instructions too, which can be gleaned by analyzing the dietary regulations and the use of biodiversity in different religious rites. These, however, have not been included in the present article.",

Every man has certain expectations about remaining alive and an untimely death (i.e., one before the normal span of life is complete) is one that human beings are naturally averse from, but that is not the real point. The point is being killed: or at any rate that's where we begin. But it is not being killed in any manner (e.g., struck by lightning or buried in an earthquake); it is only being killed by another man. Why is it this and not other ways of being killed that are relevant? What does being killed by another man signify? It signified failure in the 'race' for precedence which constitutes human life-failure, not in competition with the natural world, but in competition with other human beings. And this I take to be the central point; and this is what is meant by shameful death. To be killed by another man is eo ipso shameful or dishonourable because it signified that inferiority vis-a-vis other men which is the centre of all human aversion. In other words, desire is directed, not towards survival, but towards being first (and thus being 'honoured' and meriting 'honour'); and aversion is",

In such instances, the act of collecting things represents voluntary, controlled, goal-directed, selective searching. Pathologic patterns of collecting have been observed following brain damage, particularly frontal lobe damage, ranging from a tendency to grasp (prehension behavior) to an irrepressible need to seize surrounding objects and store them (hoarding behavior). These adnormal behaviors express an excessive adherence to environmental stimuli but in no way express a planned process directed toward specific items. In this article, we describe an unusual pattern of pathologic collecting behavior due to frontal lobe damage: involuntary irrepressible collecting that is goal-directed and selective. The authors report a patient who collected specifically household electrical appliances following a bilateral damage of orbito- and polar-prefrontal cortex. The patient had involuntary irrepressible collecting that was goal-directed and selective. This “forced collectionism” is different from that of the usual collectionism encountered in patients with frontal lobe lesions, as the latter is in no way a planned process directed toward specific items.",

      "abstract": "THE FICKLENESS OF LUCK is a standing motif in our culture. For many, is defined by unpredictability more than anything else. In Norse culture, the case is quite the opposite in that had nothing to do with what we would refer to as coincidence or chance. On the contrary, was a quality inherent in the and his lineage, a part of his personality similar to his strength, intelligence, or skill with weapons, at once both the cause and the expression of the success, wealth, and power of a family. Luck expressed itself partially in skills, beauty, and other desirable characteristics, but also in events shaping themselves according to the wishes of the lucky man. One might have in specified areas but not in others, such as fishingluck or weatherluck for example. But the so-called man of was the who possessed generally, not just in one specific area. People possessed in different measure and one was helpless against an opponent who had greater luck. Kings especially were great men of to the degree that they were able to send forth their to assist others. Luck was not a thing to be sought or found by coincidence; one had the that one was accorded by fate. Yet, in certain cases could be diminished or lost, a phenomenon on which I shall elaborate later. As to the more specific details of how the notion of was perceived, not much is known, and scholarship on the topic has been relatively limited. I find that the view of as part of a man's inherent nature sets the Norse concept of uniquely apart from a more modern conception, and it is this aspect of that I will investigate in this article. More specifically, I shall attempt to elucidate an aspect of that has only been touched upon by a few scholars and not for many decades: the view of Norse society on and the lack of it. I find that the concept of has certain implications for society's view of the luck-man and his counterpart, the luckless man. If is one of a man's personal qualities, it may possibly affect the judgment of his character. Luck may be considered not as a morally neutral factor as in modern Western society, but a requisite part of an ideal personality. Certain Norse texts seem to imply a degree of moral condemnation of the luckless man, and it is this aspect of luck--society's view of the lucky and unlucky man--that I will investigate. Was an essential and required part of the personality of the ideal or heroic male? Was the luckless correspondingly considered morally impaired? Was there an element of condemnation attached to lucklessness? The conception designated in modern English by the word luck is highly complex. This fact is reflected in the Norse terminology used to describe the various ideas of luck. The main terms are as follows: gipta, gofa, heill, fylgja, and hamingja. The words audna, sola, and hugr are also used in connection with but are less important to the central questions of this article. The meaning of these terms ranges from the abstract luck-quality, inherent in a man, which he may send forth for the assistance of someone else to a goddess of a certain family; a diversity that witnesses the complexity of the concept of luck. RESEARCH HISTORY The various terms for figure so frequently and widely in Norse literature--predominantly in sagas--that there is no reason to doubt that played an important role in the culture. The question is whether we may consider our sources, which are texts written in a Christian age, to be reliable sources of pre-Christian Norse thought and religion. In this case, one may conclude that the concept at least to some degree accurately reflects a pre-Christian mode of thought since large parts of its content and use clearly do not correspond to Christian ideas and thus cannot derive from them. Though the idea of guardian spirits might be borrowed from Christianity, the idea of as a force emanating from a person could hardly be. …",

      "abstract": "The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines a refugee as any person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. In 1985, El-Hinnawi identified a new class of persons known as ‘environmental refugees’. He defined environmental refugees as those people who have been forced to leave their traditional habitat, temporarily or permanently, because of a marked environmental disruption (natural and/or triggered by people) that jeopardized their existence and/or seriously affected the quality of their life. \r\n\r\nThis note seeks to understand whether highlighting environmental damage and degradation as a single cause of migration, or as a single consequence of migration, has any benefit. The term ‘environmental refugee’ will be examined from a legal perspective and from an environmental perspective. It will be asked whether the issue of environmental refugees is an environmental problem or a legal problem. The answer, that it is an environmental problem, will account for much of the confusion stemming from the term in international law. Finally, it will be asked whether highlighting environmental refugees, if not of benefit to the displaced persons, is of benefit to the environment.",

In particular, since the moral duty to obey seems to many a relatively basic, natural, nonvoluntary feature of social life, it seems initially promising to suppose that the moral principle that accounts for this duty belongs to that group of principles that specifies our natural moral duties. Natural Duty theories of the duty to obey the law, as we have seen, are those that ground our duty to obey not in who we are (as in Associative accounts) or in what we've done or enjoyed (as in Transactional accounts), but rather either (a) in the moral importance of advancing some impartial moral good or (b) in some moral duty thought to be owed by all persons to all others as moral equals, regardless of roles, relationships, or transactions. Thus, the natural duty in question, from which the duty to obey is to be derived, could be a consequentialist moral duty to promote or maximize the occurrence of some good property or state of affairs – such as happiness (utility, preference satisfaction, etc.), moral perfection, or justice.",

      "abstract": "The Space around Us We live in a world. Most of the objects around us, as well as the space they occupy, are three-dimensional. The word three-dimensional (3D) is derived from the three dimensions by which most objects (or spaces) can be measured: height, width and depth. Another way of describing 3D forms is their volume. The best way to visualize the volume of an object is to imagine the object as a hollow or empty space that could be filled with a liquid (such as water). Large objects or forms have large/massive volumes. The smaller the object--the the smaller is its volume. Visual Elements of Form and Space There are three basic elements that comprise the visual landscape of form and space: 1) Plane 2) Line 3) Point A plane is a defined/delineated surface of a form or A plane can be delineated by another plane (or planes)--thus forming a line between them. A point is typically a termination of multiple lines. Volume is the resulting size of the planes or surfaces enclosing the form or A plane has two dimensions: width and height. A line has one dimension: length. A point has no dimensions--it only serves as a reference for location/position. Positive and Negative Forms and Space Three-dimensional space is not limited to forms or objects. The inside of a room or the inside of a building also constitutes These spaces are referred to as space. Negative space must be defined or delineated by walls or other positive surfaces. It is helpful to have at least three distinct, related surfaces that define or enclose the negative space in order for us to visualize it. Most environments contain both positive and negative spaces. In a room, for example, the furniture, the piano, and the walls represent the positive spaces. The empty space between the furniture, piano, and the walls is the negative Sculptors, architects, industrial designers, and interior designers are all trained to deal with the design and organization of positive and negative In sculpture, the negative space elements are an integral part of the design and can be just as expressive and exciting to the human eye as the positive forms. Classification of 3D Forms Geometric forms/solids are classified into two major groups: 1) Curved (Ellipsoid/Sphere, Cylinder, Cone) 2) Straight (Cube/Rectangular Solids, Pyramid, Tetrahedron) Some forms are referred to as amorphous--they have a complex shape of their own and cannot be easily classified or associated with some of the standard geometric solids. Organic (or natural) forms can also be sometimes classified within the geometric range of forms, which would be classified within the ellipsoid/ spherical grouping of geometric solids. Within the curved category of forms, the sphere is visually the simplest because it is perfectly symmetrical. The cube is the simplest form in the straight category because of its equal and symmetrical dimensions and right angles. Perhaps the most well known organic form is the egg. It is not a true ellipsoid because of its asymmetrical horizontal (short) axis. It is this asymmetrical feature that makes the egg such an interesting and dynamic form. Movements and Forces 3D forms and spaces can be analyzed by examining some of the or structural elements of the forms and their surrounding For example, all 3D solids have an inner (or structural) axis. The inner structure of a form (the axis being an important part of this) can have a direct effect on the outer surfaces and character of the form. It is necessary then, to develop somewhat of an X-ray vision in order to imagine the inner structure and thus better understand the visual surfaces and character of the finished form. …",

These works are of the following kind. Canonists, who treat the impediment caused by sorcery more than do theologians, say (cited above) that sorcery is used not only to prevent someone from being able to carry out the carnal act, as was discussed above, but also to prevent a woman from conceiving or, if she does conceive, to cause her to have a miscarriage. A third way is added along with a fourth in that in a case where they do not cause a miscarriage, they eat up the baby or offer him to a demon. There is no doubt about the first two ways, since without the help of demons a human can use natural means, like plants and other impediments, to cause a woman to be unable to beget or conceive, as was discussed above. Regarding the other two ways, however, it should be asserted that they are caused by sorcerers, without it being necessary to adduce the arguments when these things are rendered believable by the clearest indications and proofs from experience.",

      "abstract": "Six accidental cases caused by overlooking latent environmental danger were analyzed and the geneses and mechanism of the human error involved were discussed. In all cases detection of the danger was easy or indications by some warning were distinct. In a typical case, a lineman, after cleaning the insulators of a suspended line, proceeded toward the danger zone of another line charged with current on reaching the ground. He disregarded the warning flag, and received a shock and fell to the ground. It was also common in all the other cases that victims were conducting relatively easy or habitual activities and responded, being almost unaware of the unusual physical characteristics of the environment, to its more apparent aspects. These errors were relevant to experimental results by the author that subjects had great difficulty in identifying the rule of presentation of signal figures if the key item and the rule, either serial or positional, were different from foregoing trials. It is suggested that an individual fails to see an external object that has little function value in regard to the content of the current behavior under influence of personal habitual experiences and the theories of human error need to be reconstruct as the basis of ecological knowledge about them.",

(1) The stranger’s foreignness appears twofold: as an inaccessibility of meaning and as a not belonging to a group. Relative foreignness, related to a specific order, is opposed to ­radical foreignness that disturbs and overrides all order. (2) The host is like a passerby (Simmel). He questions the property of the owner, as the latter is no longer the master in his own house (Freud). The host foreshadows the radical otherness of the Other (Levinas). (3) The enemy looks like the ­rival on the opposite bank who is killed, and the opponent we fight against transforms into something that we exploit or even destroy like a wild beast (Locke). The enemy is the opponent without refuge. One can distinguish in detail between ethnocentric, cosmocentric, and legal hostility, directed against the enemies of mankind, as well as between cold hostility armed with technical devices and warm hostility fueled by hatred without pretenses. In short, hostility arises due to repressed Otherness and refusing hospitality.",

      "title": "Aristotle's Forbidden Sweets",
      "abstract": "Aristotle's Forbidden Sweets JAMES BOGEN JULIUS MORAVCSIK I To ACT INCONTINENTLYis to do what one knows or strongly believes is not to be done (NE 1146b25-31).' Is incontinence possible? It is clear that one can do what one knows or believes is not to be done if one does it unintentionally or unknowingly. A man's conviction that champagne should not be spilled on the dress of the wife of his college's president will not prevent him from spilling it on her if he is tripped or if he mistakes her for someone else on whom champagne should be spilled. But Aristotle's question is whether a man can freely and intentionally do what he knows or believes he should not do when he realizes what it is that he is doing. Speaking very generally, Aristotle's answer is that a man may have knowledge or beliefs that have no influence on what he does on a particular occasion. For example, a man who is gripped by uncontrollable anger may fail to recall or consider something he knows or believes and so may act against that belief or bit of knowledge (1146b32ff.). In cases in which a belief or bit of knowledge plays no part in, determining an agent's behavior, incontinence is possible. It is only in cases where the belief or knowledge plays a fully active role in the determination of a man's action that incontinence is impossible (1146b35). Unfortunately, the details of Aristotle's view are less clear than its outline. How can we be said to retain a belief or bit of knowledge when it does not The authors constitute The West Coast Ancient Philosophy Collective. The general lines of this interpretation come from a meeting of the Northern California Aristotle reading group attended by the authors and Alan Code, David Glidden, Richard McKirahan, and Henry Mendell . Details of the interpretation came from comments from J. O. Urmson and extensive discussion with Charles Young, who made so many valuable and helpful suggestions that we offered him honorary membership in the collective, which he declined, saying that he preferred to appear in a footnote. 1 Unless otherwise noted, all references are to passages in the Nicomachaean Ethics (NE). [11:1 112 HISTORY or PHILOSOPHY determine our behavior? Which sorts of belief or knowledge are inactive in the incontinent man? In the Nicomachaean Ethics the most detailed discussion of a case of incontinence and the best place to look for the specifics of Aristotle's account is the following difficult and often discussed passage. [l] Again, we may also look to the cause of incontinence scientifically [physikos] in this way: On the one hand there is a universal belief, while the other belief is concerned with particular things over which perception is immediately authoritative [KvQi(~]. When one belief arises out of these it is necessary [&v~yKTI]in one case for the mind to affirm the conclusion, and with beliefs concerned with conduct [~v 8~ ~(~g z~QCtK~tKCffg] ~ one must act straightway. [1147a~4-28 ] [2] For example, if one should taste everything sweet, and this thing is sweet, being one of those particular things, then a man who is able and not being prevented must of necessity do this immediately. [ x147a28- 31 ] [3] And so, when there is in the mind one universal belief which forbids tasting, and another belief that every sweet thing is pleasant, and this is sweet (and this belief is active), then when desire happens to be present, the one belief tells us to avoid this, but desire leads us to it (for it can move each of the parts). 3 l1147a3t-35] [4] And so it turns out that one acts incontinently in some way under a principle or belief which is not in itself but is only incidentally opposed to the right belief [~ 8Q00~ L6y~] (for it is the desire and not the belief which is opposed). 4 [1147a35 lt47b2 ] [5] That is why animals are not incontinent; they do not have a grasp of universals, but they have only mental images and memories of particular things.

      "title": "Developing the Ego-Ideal of High School Students",
      "abstract": "The of individuals is the single element found in the personality structure of individuals that either fosters or prevents delinquency and crime; so if our goal in the high school is to prevent delinquency and crime it begins with the development of a satisfactory ego-ideal. It is the basic element in Third Force Psychology that explains the dynamics underlying all human behavior (Cassel, 2000; & Rogers and Dymond, 1954). The specific attributes and nature of an ego-ideal that prevents crime is always intimately related to the particular form of government an individual is expected to live and thrive in. For living effectively in a democracy it has to do with a meaningful configuration of some of the following: 1. First and foremost freedom to be one's self and to break away from dependence on all others, and to be able to make own decisions in a more or less scientific fashion. 2. Second, and equally important, is the ability and willingness to be a team member, playing daily roles in such a fashion that the whole is always greater than the sum of it's parts. It must be recognized and accepted that no team is ever stronger than the weakest member, so that each member must be assigned to make full use of talents possessed. 3. Third, that all individuals are equal and that each and ever one must fully recognize that equality and with full acceptance of the other, but that we are all human beings; each with our own particular weaknesses and strengths; so that in full team fashion one's strengths are emphasized and weaknesses are minimized. 4. Finally, there is the matter of play and honesty in a never ending episode that is always adapted to one's daily life and the conditions that emerge in special situations. Trustworthiness derives almost solely from honesty and fair play, and it is the most basic requisite for success in a democracy. Adolescent Years The adolescent years of individuals are typically associated with growing pains and with change, and the dream and desire of early becoming an adult; as only adults are free to make life choices. The typical high school in a democracy includes our youth between 14 and 18 years of age, the period of adolescence when change is the order of the clay and stability in life is often a dream away. It is during these years when typically the ego-ideal is being formulated and developed, and whether it is acceptable or not is determined by the success or failure of the individuals involved. Assessing the Ego-Status In true scientific fashion the effective fashioning of one's ego-ideal begins with some realistic assessment of the present ego-status of each and every individual involved. This is not to be a subjective estimate by a counselor or school psychologist, but rather the use of sound and effective psychological tests that seek to uncover the attributes that depict such critical elements as: (1) Personal maturity, (2) social integration, and (3) the presence and nature of cognitive dissonance Democratic Maturity The Democratic Maturity Test (DEMO) has been developed for purposes of assessing in scientific fashion the Personal Maturity and Social Integration of individuals (Cassel & Chow, 2000). It is based solidly on the definition of John Dewey for a democracy--The of independent individuals. The personal maturity part of DEMO has to do with assessing the independence factor, and the social integration with the interdependence element in the Dewey definition. Cognitive Dissonance The Cognitive Dissonance Test (DISS) has been developed to assess the presence of cognitive dissonance (unconscious type of hurts) that lie deep in the unconscious, and which are typically created by the presence of personal needs that have not been well gratified (Cassel & Chow, 2000). The purpose of the testis to bring those hurts to the conscious level so that individuals can find ways and means to gratify personal needs responsible for the dissonance. …",

In other words, they mark when they are likely to attack another member of the same species, and are likely to win if they do attack. Such a situation occurs, as Hediger (13) pointed out, in connection with territoriality but it also occurs in other kinds of social systems. Frequent, vigorous marking occurs at times when there is reason to infer that the animal is motivated to aggression. The effects of marks and marking upon other individuals are poorly understood. Many species mark with more than one source of scent in response to one stimulus or set of stimuli.",

Other factors limiting our freedom are our ignorance, our passions and our habits.

      "title": "Debts of Good Will and Interpersonal Justice",
      "abstract": "A debt of good will (utang na loob in Filipino) is incurred when a person becomes the beneficiary of significant assistance or favor given by another. Usually, the beneficiary is in acute need of the assistance given or favor granted. This provides an opportunity for the giving of help to serve as a vehicle for the expression of sympathy or concern. The debt could then be appreciated as one of good will because, by catering to another person's pressing need, the benefactor is able to express positive dispositions towards the beneficiary. It is not merely the receipt of the assistance or favor that puts the recipient in a position of indebtedness. The indebtedness is created by the benefactor's kagandahang loob (good will). An act can be considered to convey kagandahang loob only if it is done out of kusang loob (roughly, free will); and can only be considered to have been done out of kusang loob if the agent (1) is not acting under external compulsion, (2) is motivated by positive feelings (e.g. charity, love or sympathy) towards the beneficiary, and (3) is not motivated by the anticipation of reward. These conditions entail debt-of-goodwill relationships where the benefactor has no right to demand reciprocity but the beneficiary has a \"self-imposed\" obligation to repay kagandahang loob with kagandahang loob. Debts of good will are about some forms of justice. But we should not reduce all talk about debts of good will to talk about justice.",

Physical damage ordinarily occurs where there is some change in the state or structure of a person’s body, or where there is some change in the state or structure of tangible property. The author argues that courts have, in recent wrongful conception and contamination cases, widened the orthodox notion of what constitutes physical damage. The courts have employed an ordinary bystander test in order to determine whether particular failures of care, arising in circumstances of high or unnecessary risk of physical harm, should be treated as if they give rise to physical damage. These are cases of a new form of actionable damage, that is, damage of a socially constructed kind.",

If one acts so as to achieve the object of an irrational desire, one needs a reason for acting in that way in order for one’s actions to count as rational.

Reasons for acting are conscious rational beliefs that can make some otherwise irrational actions, rationa/.1 The belief that having one’s right arm cut off will save one’s life is a reason for having one’s arm cut off. In the discussion of irrational desires, several of these kinds of beliefs were mentioned. Beliefs that one’s action will decrease one’s own or anyone else’s chances of dying, of suffering pain, or of losing some ability, freedom, or pleasure count as reasons. These beliefs are reasons because they can sometimes make acting to achieve the object of an irrational desire rational.

Feelings of compassion call for an 'imaginative dwelling' on the particular circumstances of another. We will not have this experience or it will be misdirected if we do not treat the other person as an identifiable individual; someone with a particular history; someone with particular needs and desires. Compassion, in short, calls for particularity. The administration of the law, in contrast, calls for abstraction, it encourages an approach which treats people in general terms. Law's emphasis is on generality and the sameness of people; for justice demands that rights and obligations be applied equally, often irrespective of particular circumstances. That judges settle disputes according to law (and not moral principles or feelings) and that bureaucrats administer without affection or illwill are regulative ideals of our legal and administrative structures.",

The characteristics of an evil person, neatly summarized in Baumeister’s “myth of pure evil,” include a presumably unchanging, unrelenting capacity to inflict unjustifiable harm. Consequently, evildoers—which, in the popular imagination, include evil spirits, perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse, and serial killers—pose the ultimate threat. People may therefore resort to extreme measures (like potentially lethal exorcism attempts) to resist, punish, or destroy them. Places and things, by virtue of their association with evildoers and/or their capacity to evoke raw negative feelings such as dread, can sometimes function as evil symbols.",

Normally, a brick full-force at close range to the head of an unconscious victim, followed by a dance of glee at the splattered blood, would leave little question about the thrower's intent to kill. But when done as part of a mob, we are told, no such intention exists. Smashing with the brick also might normally show an intent to permanently disfigure, as aggravated mayhem requires, but not so for rioters. Riot used to be an offense. Now it's a defense. No other state, or country in the world, past and present, has ever recognized such a defense. The new riot defense conceives of a riot as something that takes away a person's normal mental faculties. But everything we know about rioting suggests that it doesn't take away thinking or control, just conscience.",

      "title": "Reply to “a non-paternalistic value theory for occupational therapy: a response to Dige”",
      "abstract": "Sandman makes it sound as if I am the one who defends a contentious theory whereas the alternatives, i.e. hedonistic or desire-fulfilment theories, are more uncontroversial or “minimal”. I fail to see this because I find it much more straightforward to say that certain elements of a human life, e.g. accomplishment, personal relationships, and understanding, have a direct or intrinsic value and therefore are something that it is good to enjoy or desire whereas others, e.g. monotony, isolation, and confusion, have a direct or intrinsic disvalue and therefore are something that is not worth enjoying or desiring. It is not entirely clear whether Sandman wants to challenge the view that activity is intrinsically better than passivity or the view that specific types of activities (e.g. those involving personal relationships, understanding, and accomplishment) are objectively better than others in the sense that they constitute genuine, intrinsic values. The first point is easily misunderstood. The claim that activity is intrinsically good does not imply an ideal of hyperactivity and extreme sports. Sandman’s examples of rather monotonous and mindless activities (playing Tetris and “ordering, reordering and ordering again a set of differently coloured pens”) are interesting only if they more or less take up all the person’s time. Most of us use a considerable amount of time on activities like that (for better or worse). It becomes a professional (OT) challenge only if the person seems incapable of enjoying or desiring anything else and I have a hard time imagining a responsible occupational therapist who would accept a life of total passivity (taking part in no challenging or social or self-involving activities whatsoever) as a possible ideal life. The second point is a matter of considerable philosophical controversy and it would be overly ambitious to try to settle it definitively. Hence, apart from what I have said in the original article, I will just offer an example for consideration. Imagine a child in an elementary school who exclaims: “But I do not want to come to understand maths or grammar or anything else at all and I do not want to interact with you teachers and the other children and I do not want to make school work my own accomplishment!” That would certainly be a pedagogic challenge but I think it would take a lot more than this to make it a challenge to our belief in these values. On the contrary, it would simply be unprofessional if the schoolteachers reassessed their mission and value commitments to the effect that they gave up on teaching maths to those who did not want it, allowed the antisocial children to be left alone, and so on. Quite another but very important consideration is that we sometimes have to settle for something short of the ideal. Imagine for example that the child suffers from social phobia and gets extremely anxious when",

Therefore, 'unless each duly cares for himself, his care for others is ended by death; and if each thus dies, there remain no others to be cared for.'1 To the extent that a man is rational he will first address himself to his own survival and only then attempt to satisfy his less immediate needs, an attempt that usually exhausts his time and energy without providing as great a return as he would like. Even if he is fortunate and his resources are not exhausted, he may decide to save them to put things away for 'a rainy day.' In the former situation there is nothing to distribute to those in need; in the latter, kindliness ('helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself2) does not seem to be consistent with a man's long-range self-interest. In either case, kindliness is not perceived as rational. To sum up : since kindliness is not rational in the face of death, and seldom rational when death is not imminent, it appears to follow that kindliness is generally not a rational act. At least four classic ethical traditions, Judaism, Christianity, Kantianism, and Utilitarianism (especially Mill's theory), reject this argument. Each maintains that there is a duty to help others and that this duty, the duty of beneficence, when properly understood is not irrational.",

      "title": "The Doctrine of Harm in Law",
      "abstract": "Law is based on the basic rights of individuals—of people with a conscience, morality, and philosophy—which translates to the daily common sense of humans and their moral behavior. These lead to an understanding of what is ‘‘reasonable’’ and ‘‘acceptable’’ within the human context for norms of behavior. By far, the most pervasive doctrine and philosophy of law is the doctrine of mutual respect where no party is permitted to hurt another. In fact, one is not even allowed to hurt oneself, because doing so is against the common principle and purpose of human life. The concept of ‘‘hurt’’ takes on physical, mental, economic, and reputational aspects. This doctrine pervades every area of law, be it environmental law, liability law, or contract law. Moreover, each and every one of The Ten Commandments revolves around not hurting or damaging another or oneself or the source of the universe, since we get all our energy from there. No one can be harmed or damaged—willfully or negligently. This requires the exercise of caution and restraint by all individuals in every part of their daily life: at the mall, on the road, in public meetings, and under professional circumstances. The philosophy of human rights stems from the fundamental belief that no one should be harmed or deprived from basic human needs—food, medicine, shelter, respect, physical security, and spiritual freedom. It is for freedom from harm that all laws are enacted in a civil society. It is this simple concept of ‘‘harm’’ that underpins law and seeks to interpret situations to discover who is at fault for having generated the harm. The interpretation of this in civil engineering is convoluted, for issues of technology, engineering, business, accounting, and finance are intertwined with principles of law. A lawyer alone will be unable to interpret civil engineering law, while a civil engineer alone will similarly fail to understand the legal ramifications of the issues. This is why it takes lawyers and civil engineers, working together, to solve their legal problems. Consequently, this also underpins the need for our special Legal Affairs section. In institutional matters—such as issues of contract law, criminal law, liability law, or insurance law—it is hard to justify the supposition that any random technique and means will be justified by the end. Every action taken must be harmless and benign. Negligence and ignorance of the harmful effects of actions do not exempt one. There is too much respect and dignity for morality, the individual, and the rights of life and free commerce for harm to be allowed at any time.",

However, again depending on Malebranche, Leibniz distinguishes God’s ‘general will’ with which all events correspond, from God’s ‘particular will’ from which miracles ensue. How this view is consistent with God’s simplicity is not resolved until article 16 with the notion of God’s ‘extraordinary concourse’. Another difficulty arises, however: Since everything occurs according to God’s general will, God appears to be responsible for all evils (misfortunes as well as human moral transgression). Leibniz attempts to solve this problem with the notion of God’s ‘permissive will’, which means that while God always disapproves of evil, he permits it (so as not to interfere with human freedom), but only because he knows how to derive a greater good from it. This does not mean that God uses evil to make things better, but that <italic>in spite</italic> of evil, the good arises eventually.",

That and/or there encodes the fact that the child perceives an object, that he successfully completes a plan, or that an object changes its location. No encodes the fact that the child does not successfully implement a plan, that he intends to repeat a plan, and oh dear that his plan fails. Gone encodes the fact that the child does .not perceive an object, down and up encode downward and upward movement, in and encode movement to or out of a container, and on and off encode attachment and detachment. Children initially used these expressions egocentric, action-oriented ways and later used them more objective ways. The cognitive literature provides the basis for an account of the development of the concepts encoded by these expressions, particularly, the concepts of abstract aspects of plans, of disappearance, balance, containment and attachment. These concepts appear to be developed at around 18 months, that is,at about the same time that the words that encode them first appear. This suggests that early nonnominal expressions encode new, problematic, concepts, rather than well-established concepts. It is argued that the development of early non-nominal expressions could facilitate the development of the abstract concepts they encode. This argument may also be applied to early names.",

      "abstract": "Generally, when people speak of water as a resource, they are considering its good aspects and recognizing that it is essential for life and living. Sometimes or at some places or to some people, the same water may be annoying or unpleasant and thus a nuisance-for example, rain at a picnic, snow at any time except Christmas Eve, ground water in a basement, floodwater inundating personal property, and any water after it has been polluted by somebody else. For purposes of this circular, water as a resource will be defined more broadly and as a nuisance more narrowly. Water is part of the natural resource base including all aspects of the land, the air, and the water that must be considered in planning if an environment suitable for the well-being of all life is to be maintained. A nuisance, private or public, is a cause of annoyance, inconvenience, or injury that is an invasion or disturbance of the rights of some particular person or of members of a community, and it is punishable under the laws or customs accepted by the community. An activity harmful to mankind but widely practiced by the general public may be condoned by human laws and thus not be defined legally as a nuisance; the punishment for this activity is deterioration of the natural environment until it becomes unsuitable for living. The water resource, which is widely and irregularly distributed on earth, is available to man for such enjoyment and development and use as he sees fit, some use being essential to his existence. Natural variations in the quantity and quality of water are inevitable and, if they cause annoyance or injury to someone, are accepted as one of the hardships that this planet imposes upon its inhabitants; such variations are recognized as \"acts of God.\" However, if any man or society is partly responsible for these variations, which may cause such annoyance or injury, and may become a nuisance (an invasion or disturbance of the rights of others) such a man or society may perhaps be subject to injunctions and damage suits. Legal disputes over water as a nuisance are generally deeply involved with problems of the respective rights of plaintiff and defendant. These respective rights vary among the States.",

Therefore, Islam requires every food that we eat should have benefit the whole elements of the body. Therefore, what is consumed must meet the essential needs of all elements of the body. The purpose of the essential is a positive association between consumption activity with structured activities from elements of the bodies themselves.

There is a great human good in being properly related to God, in subordinating our wills to the will of an absolutely perfect being. But this good will be unavailable to us unless God takes a certain practical stance toward us. First, God must not will that we act contrary to the norms of morality that bind us. Second, God’s will must be a sufficiently good proximate standard for action, better than acting on our own discretion or on some other proximate standard. This chapter argues that God can indeed take on a contingent ethics that meets these constraints, either through forming discretionary intentions or through performing certain speech-acts (e.g. making promises to, or covenants with, us humans).",

The senses’ respective representational modes, styles, and structures differ very strongly from each other. (2) The Layering thesis. A single sensory representation usually has more than one content; the perceptual state represents one object or property by representing a more primitive or less ambitious one. Though this “layering” is ubiquitous, its structure and range differs dramatically as between sense modalities, and in some modalities it works unexpectedly: for example, nearly all tactual representation derives from representation of conditions of or in the subject’s own skin, meaning that touch represents, e.g., the texture of a physical object by, and only by, representing stress within the skin; also the tactual layering is remarkably fine-grained and rich. (3) Aspect perception. Besides the intrinsic interest of “perceiving as”—even popular appeal, what with joke ambiguous figures such as the duck-rabbit and the old/young woman—it remains especially mysterious. Nearly all work on it has concerned vision only. But it is crucial for understanding auditory representation, which is one thing that distinguishes hearing from the other senses. Further, the auditory case greatly reinforces the idea that perceiving-as depends on expectations, it severely damages what we had thought was the best further approach to understanding aspect perception, in terms of attention.",

A human being first comprehended the number of things and objects and then tried to express them by means of languages. Gradually there appeared the existence of more than one things and there emerged the necessity of expressing them. In Turkic languages, including Azerbaijani, the abundance of things began to be expressed by the numeral three, then it reached forty, which was the maximal limit. It found its expression in fairy-tales and eposes, as well as in proverbs. For instance: Atalar üçəcən deyiblər (Our forefathers counted up to theree or allowed do something only thrice); Üç gün, üç gecə yol getdilər (They walked three days and nights); Qırx gün möhlət vermək(They granted him a delay for forty days); Qırx gün, qırx gecə döyüşmək (They fought for forty days and nights); qırx qapını açmaq (to open forty doors); divin canını qırxıncı otaqda tapmaq (to find the vigour (life) of the giant in the fortieth room), etc. All this shows that the expression of the category of number in language has undergone a long historical process.",

      "title": "The Foot of Compassion and Complicity",
      "abstract": "Sym-pathy or com-passion means sharing pain or trouble. Foot and shoe are often employed to denote sympathy as in “If I were in your shoes.” Foot and shoe, albeit less often, can also be a means to represent complicity, which means folding clothes together. People sometimes have to avoid bad memory or situations and want a closer and more personal bond with like-minded people, so that they together forge fictional scenarios that account for hard situations to them. The main objective of this essay is to explore aspects of the liaison between shoe-foot and compassion-complicity in various cultural and textual sources. 1) The pure sympathy or firm ties and its opposite cases are rather simply represented by one’s putting on the same shoes and taking them off respectively. 2) A shaky and unstable bond is indicated by the abnormal or weak foot which impedes walking itself. The self-exiled 20th Irish modernists, Joyce and Beckett, invent walking obstructions such as flat-foot and disabled feet in the depiction of their ambivalent attitude toward the fatherland. 3) Sylvia Plath’s “Daddy” and Sharon Creech’s Walk Two Moons can be said to present certain cases of the complicitous relationship. Mentally stricken, Plath had maintained an imaginary life in the dead father’s boots for 30 years, and, when that relationship was not needed any more, decided to quit her life for good. In Creech’s novel, the two young female classmates whose mothers have equally vanished from home join the complicity which makes them take their situations for a conspiracy-induced one. Only when they wear others’ “moccasins to walk two moons,” their understanding of others can be turned from the narrow and self-serving one to a truly sympathetic one.",

As one whistleblower put it, \"They wouldn't talk about it, and they wouldn't talk about not talking about it.\" Silence does not just mean the absence of speech. Silence means that one party to the dialogue refuses to engage the other. Whistleblowers try to talk about what the organization is doing. Their bosses will only talk about the whistleblowers and their problems. \"Nuts and sluts\" is the name given to this strategy by experienced whistleblowers, in which the goal of the organization is to turn the issue into one of the mental health or morality of the whistleblower. What is unsaid, what cannot be spoken, is almost always the moral and ideological corruption of the organization. Corruption means the loss of an organization's mission. Society is a conspiracy of silence against those who cross an invisible boundary that most of us will not recognize, for to do so would establish our willingness to do almost anything to belong.",

      "title": "Less Trust Means More Trusts",
      "abstract": "The word “trust” has multiple meanings. In everyday speech, it refers to a feeling of confidence associated with integrity, such as trusting that a friend will keep a secret. In the financial context, some law students, lawyers and lucky individuals also understand that a trust is a near-magical device that splits legal and equitable title. A trustee holds formal legal title to property for the benefit of a beneficiary simply because the grantor declares it to be so. By turning the spotlight on “trust,” in both senses of the world, one can discern fault lines in contemporary U.S. political and legal structures. These are made even plainer when examined through the lens of ongoing litigation involving human embryos created by actress Sofia Vergara and her former fiance. \r\n\r\nJust as termites can enter homes through foundational cracks or wood brought from the outside, interpersonal, community or structural confidence may erode in the face of hostility, indifference or inequality. Similarly, as termites can slowly damage a home over a period of years before the harm becomes visible, the beneficial form of ownership known as a trust gradually – and then suddenly – has morphed almost beyond recognition over the last twenty-five years. Eaten away are the traditional limitations on trust duration, trust modification and the type of property that can be held in trust. In some states, irrevocable trusts can last forever, be decanted to another trust with entirely different terms, or even hold legal “title” to human embryos. These changes to centuries of trust law reveal changing attitudes about wealth, property ownership, and personal autonomy. If society truly values equal opportunity for all people, then trust – and trusts – need attention.",

Third, a law-abiding subject may be (mis)guided by their superego, taking comfort in inhuman bystander legalism. Fourth, institutional dynamics can spearhead bystander groupthink.

      "abstract": "Kazakh culture has a rich mythological heritage, and Kazakh legends are an important source for reflecting on the history, beliefs, and values of the Kazakh people. This article focuses on the motif of petrification, which is frequently seen in Kazakh legends. Petrification is the most common type of shape-shifting motif, where a superior power turns living or inanimate elements into stone to save them from disaster or to punish them. It features examples of people, animals, houses, and other things being petrified. This can happen when individuals beg god to get them out of difficult situations, punish enemies, or help them cope with deep sadness. Being petrified is a punishment for the bad and a salvation for the good. This study examined 15 Kazakh legends and classified the motif of petrification under six types: 1) petrification due to the wrath of God; 2) petrification due to one’s wish or someone else’s prayer; 3) petrification due to a curse; 4) petrification due to Exhaustion and inability to fight; 5) petrification due to sadness; and 6) petrification of a dead animal. Furthermore, based on the motif of petrification, the legends’ underlying meaning and educational value were defined and their significance was unfolded.",

      "title": "Sentiment and Sentimentality in Music",
      "abstract": "A sentiment is an emotion. Sentimentality is counterfeit emotion. Emotions are intentional, evaluative states with aspects that are both mental and bodily. To say that emotions are intentional is to say that they are about something or mentally directed toward something. To say that emotions are evaluative is to say that they appraise objects and events as regards their bearing on the condition of the emotional being. How the object of a given emotion bears on one’s condition determines the emotion’s distinctive core relational theme (Lazarus 1991, 122), the harm or benefit it is supposed to detect. The core relational theme of anger, for example, is threat. The core relational theme of fear is danger. To say that emotions are bodily is to say that they involve action tendencies or changes in action readiness. The angry person will tend to strike out, the fearful person to freeze or to flee. Emotions are normally accompanied by arousal, or at least some intensive change measurable along one or more different axes, including axes of autonomic and electrocortical activity. Emotions may, but need not, involve a distinctive phenomenology. Passions I take to be emotions so intense and deeply rooted that they could not be counterfeit. Passion, therefore, excludes sentimentality. Bertrand Russell says of a major philosopher of the past that “he had many trivial love affairs, which were sensual but not passionate” (1945, 758), a telling remark. Sentimentality and sensuality are not too distant cousins. According to the view I favor, emotions are cognitive, but not necessarily judgmental or propositional. They are best construed as perceptual, and perception is a mode of categorization that extracts information concerning invariants from a fluctuating sensory array. Emotions do not necessarily follow upon on a conscious perceptual experience afforded by one of the special senses. This point has a basis in physiology. All the special sensory input systems project to nuclei of the thalamus before reaching the specialized sensory cortices, and the thalamus is a central component of the limbic system. Olfactory pathways also project to the",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have raised the question of whether dogs, like human infants, comprehend an established rule as generalizable, normative knowledge or rather as episodic information, existing only in the immediate situation. In the current study we tested whether dogs disobeyed a prohibition to take a treat (i) in the presence of the communicator of the ban, (ii) after a temporary absence of the communicator, and (iii) in the presence of a novel person. Dogs disobeyed the rule significantly more often when the communicator left the room for a moment or when they were faced with a new person, than when she stayed present in the room. These results indicate that dogs \"forget\" a rule as soon as the immediate human context becomes disrupted.",

      "abstract": "Humans reason and care about ethical issues, such as avoiding unnecessary harm. But what enables us to develop a moral capacity? This question dates back at least to ancient Greece and typically results in the traditional opposition between sentimentalism (the view that morality is mainly driven by socioaffective processes) and rationalism [the view that morality is mainly driven by (socio)cognitive processes or reason]. Here, we used multiple methods (eye-tracking and observations of expressive behaviors) to assess the role of both cognitive and socioaffective processes in infants’ developing morality. We capitalized on the distinction between moral (e.g., harmful) and conventional (e.g., harmless) transgressions to investigate whether 18-mo-old infants understand actions as distinctively moral as opposed to merely disobedient or unexpected. All infants watched the same social scene, but based on prior verbal interactions, an actor’s tearing apart of a picture (an act not intrinsically harmful) with a tool constituted either a conventional (wrong tool), a moral (producing harm), or no violation (correct tool). Infants’ anticipatory looks differentiated between conventional and no violation conditions, suggesting that they processed the verbal interactions and built corresponding expectations. Importantly, infants showed a larger increase in pupil size (physiological arousal), and more expressions indicating empathic concern, in response to a moral than to a conventional violation. Thus, infants differentiated between harmful and harmless transgressions based solely on prior verbal interactions. Together, these convergent findings suggest that human infants’ moral development is fostered by both sociocognitive (inferring harm) and socioaffective processes (empathic concern for others’ welfare).",

This series of studies examined whether and when preschool children are willing to attribute internal and immanent causes to motion. In 3 studies, preschool children and adults viewed animals and artifacts (wind-up toys and transparent objects) either moving independently or being transported by a person. Children explained animal and artifact events differently, even with the kind of movement controlled: They were more likely to attribute immanent cause to animals than to artifacts and more likely to attribute human cause to artifacts than animals. Internal causes were less frequently endorsed overall; however, when asked to describe the insides of artifacts, children who saw them moving alone more often described internal mechanisms (e.g., batteries, electricity) than children who did not see them moving alone. Altogether, the studies suggest that children as young as 3 or 4 years of age honor two principles: For animals more than for artifacts, movement is caused by an immanent source, and across domains, movements without an observable agent have an internal or immanent source.",

      "title": "Storing of Qi Gong Energy In Various Materials and Drugs (Qi Gongnization): Its Clinical Application For Treatment of Pain, Circulatory Disturbance, Bacterial or Viral Infections, Heavy Metal Deposits, and Related Intractable Medical Problems By Selectively Enhancing Circulation and Drug Uptake",
      "abstract": "In the process of evaluating the effects of external Qi Gong on inanimate substances by the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, Qi Gong energy was shown to have a polarity which the author designated for convenience sake (+) or (-), where (+) increases the strength of muscles and (-) weakens them. Depending upon how external Qi Gong is applied and from which part of the body it emanates, the polarity changes. In general, it was found that, when (+) polarity is applied to the painful area or spastic muscles or arteries in vaso-constriction it often reduced or eliminated the pain, spastic muscles or circulatory disturbances. The author succeeded in storing part of the Qi Gong energy in inanimate materials, such as papers, metals (such as a sheet of aluminum foil), glass, stone, band-aids, clothes, drugs, etc. in bi-polar (one end of the same material becomes (+) polarity and the other end of the same material becomes (-) polarity) form in one material or uni-polar, i.e., the entire material either has pure (+) polarity or (-) polarity. Water, EPA, vitamins, antibiotics and other drugs were also converted to (+) polarity. When the material has a bi-polar state, it becomes possible to eliminate one of the polarities by applying certain changing electrical fields. The effect of placing (+) polarity Qi Gong energy stored material was compared with direct application of the Qi Gong on pain, spastic muscle and spastic vertebral arteries. The therapeutic effects of these 2 methods were quite similar for the identical time duration but a more predictable effect was often obtained in the former. As our previous study indicates that acupuncture, electrical stimulation (1-3 pulses/sec.), as well as Qi Gong not only improved the microcirculatory disturbance and relaxed spastic muscles and vaso-constrictive arteries but also reduced or eliminated the pain and also selectively enhanced drug uptake to the area where drugs could not be delivered due to existing circulatory disturbances, by placing (+) Qi Gong stored material, such as a sheet of paper or aluminum foil, band-aid or clothes. Bi- Digital O-Ring Test evaluation indicated that not only did it produce all the beneficial effects of Qi Gong but also enhanced the drug uptake selectively in the area where it is necessary for the drug to be delivered for effective treatment, and reduced lead deposits in tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Autonomy, Diminished Life, and the Threshold for Use",
      "abstract": "Normative ethical theories today place enormous stress upon autonomy or agency and treat it as of the utmost significance to the value of human life. Some theorists understand agency as referring to personhood or to moral personality; some take it to involve such things as rationality and action upon reasons, self-awareness, self-critical control of one's desires, the application of norms to conduct, and deliberative choice. Some take it to be about making one's own decisions (in the important affairs of life) and directing one's life or about constructing a life of value for oneself or about adopting and living out a life plan or rational plan of action. On all these views, the effect is to set up agents or autonomous beings as a special or privileged class, against which the lives of nonautonomous beings – such as infants, young children, the irreversibly comatose or those in a permanently vegetative state, those suffering from senile dementia, the severely mentally enfeebled, some of the brain damaged, and animals – are assessed and valued. So privileged is this class that all kinds of notions are invented or assumed – such things as impaired autonomy, potential autonomy, interrupted capacity, unrealized capacity, trusteeship, and proxy agency come to mind – by which to try to squeeze as many beings as possible into it. The fear, obviously, is that, if some human being falls outside the privileged class, the protections that normally extend to one morally may possibly be in doubt.",

      "abstract": "The social inferiority of an elderly person stems from his physical inferiority--actual or alleged but always possible. And yet this \"inferior\" body is paradoxically hypertrophic: at first it masks the person, then takes up its space until it negates it. Hence, an elderly person is not only a body but a lonely body. In his relations with other people, his body becomes a receiver, a receptacle and a source of communication. Social violence underlies relations with elderly people: such violence may be deceptive, widespread and continuous or, on the other hand, manifest, episodic and conspicuous. In the first case it may be a way of assigning subalternate roles to them in relation to the efficiency expected of them or a way of mythologizing their condition as one of pseudo-happiness. In the second case is generally relates to assaults, thefts, bag-snatching, etc. In any case, however, communication with them entails violence: their body perceives this and reacts to it. This is why their body's language is violent: their body cries out, it is stunned and it is acted upon (even--and unavoidably--in relations with a therapist).",

      "title": "A New Census and an Old Theory: Division of Labor in the Preliterate World",
      "abstract": "\"Primitive communism\" vs. \"solitary hunter.\"-The ancient theory that division of labor is non-existent in the preliterate world is perpetuated in two mutually inconsistent forms: (1) The work of these peoples is done in common-the task of one is the task of all. (2) Primitive man is a non-co-operative \"solitary hunter\" carrying on life and labor independently of his fellows. Census method.-This theory is here tested by a labor census which classifies cases derived from published works concerning thirty tribes, division of labor being conceived, for purposes of the census, as occurring whenever any activity becomes a recognized function of a particular person, sex, or group of persons. Functional differentiation.-On the basis of degree or type of specialization, three distinct classes of activities emerge in the census: regular, incidental, occasional. Regular activities are, for the most part, daily, fulltime functions of those who engage in them, and correspond to the occupations of literate industrial society. Incidental activities occur in the course of a broader and more general set of activities or occupation. Occasional activities are performed at more or less irregular or unexpected intervals, or at stated periods widely separated in time. The appearance of these classes of activities under each of thirteen functional groupings (medicine, craftsmanship, etc.) assigns the theory above outlned to the fascinating library of academic mythology, and warrants an alternative formulation: (1) Division of labor is coextensive with preliterate social life. (2) Specialization by craft and occupation may be found in some form in every preliterate tribe. Differentiation within population classes.-The fact of division of labor receives wider significance in its relation to (1) sex, (2) age, (3) physical strength, (4) marital condition, etc. These factors cross-cut functional lines and are, in some sense, the results of the cultural assignment of functions in any given situation. There are, in fact, all sorts of social divisions of labor, and the unending complexity of these divisions must be viewed as coextensive with the infinite number of relationships, classifications, and stratified layers of preliterate social life, as well as with the manifold conceptions which individuals have of each other's abilities, capacities, and fitnesses for special duties.",

      "title": "Housing and the domestic environment",
      "abstract": "Too often the words 'house' and 'home' are used as if they are synonymous, and the word 'housing' (as a noun) is used to imply a group of houses. Before discussing the importance of house, home, and housing and the relationship these have with 'health' and 'well-being', it will be useful to give definitions for the purposes of this chapter. (Where a word or term has a specific definition for a particular purpose, such as for the interpretation of legislation, this will be made clear and the particular definition given.)The World Health Organization, Europe (WHO) considers housing to be a broad concept involving four interrelated elements – the house (or dwelling), the home, the immediate environment (or neighbourhood), and the community. The house or dwelling is the physical structureproviding shelter with the necessary space, facilities and amenities for the occupant(s) or intended occupant(s). A house is also a financial asset, mainly a personal, individual asset, but a national asset as well. As an asset, there will be a psychological significance to the owner (or person purchasing, perhaps through a mortgage), but the degree of this significance will vary depending on whether the house is intended to provide accommodation forpersonal occupation, or for renting. More relevant to this chapter is the primary purpose of a house or dwelling – that of providing somewhere to establish a home. To this end, it should be designed, constructed and maintained to provide a safe and healthy environment for the occupant(s) and any visitors. However, it is not possible to provide a completely safe and healthy dwelling – we need hazards such as electricity, stairs, cooking facilities, windows and doors – and so any necessary and unavoidable hazards should be as safe as possible. A dwelling should provide protection from the local climate, it should allow for the normal day-to-day activities of the occupant(s) throughout the year without problems, and its condition should be such that it does not interfere with the occupant(s) establishing a home. It should have sufficient space to allow for the inter-relationship between the members of the household and also allow individuals the opportunity for privacy. It should also be affordable, both in terms of the rent or mortgage repayment and in terms of the 'running-costs' – the costs of local taxes, of energy, of water, and of maintenance. The home is the social, cultural and economicstructure created by the individual or household. It is the structure that gives a human refuge from the outside world, enables the development of a sense of identity and, for a household, a sense of attachment. The home creates an environment where one can be, and develop, oneself.",

      "abstract": "What does it mean to say that a certain strip of words is somebody's language or somebody's voice or somebody's words? On what basis do we attribute words to an individual? This is a practical as well as a theoretical or linguistic question: Lucas Films not long ago sued to establish a proprietary claim to the phrase Star Wars to preserve it from use by the Administration in relation to the Strategic Defense Initiative. In a commonsense view, actual words of discourse are either mine, or someone else's, and possession in this case is grounded in having selected, ordered, and uttered the words in some sort of public event (a speech or interview or press conference) or in some written document that can be cited and checked by others. Public uttering establishes the proprietary claim. One makes words one's own not by a primary act of saying them, perhaps muttering them to oneself while driving to work; uttering that establishes a claim is a public action. We use double quotes for exact, word-for-word, verbatim use of another's words and indirect discourse forms for my report of or retelling of another's saying. This we all know, and we hold also that verbatim use of another's words without setting them off in double quotes is an act of fraudmisrepresenting another's property as one's own ... plagiarism. Further, this account explains how strips of words can be said to reflect a particular point of view or ideological bias. It is the speaker, not the words, that has the point of view; the poor words are innocent (the basis of the judge's decision in the Star Wars case)-innocent as units in the linguistic system, but sometimes laden with ideological force or value by being used by a human actor in a particular discursive situation.",

Inventions are: (a) physical, mediating an adjustment of man to his natural physical environment; (b) social, consisting of some form of social organization, adjusting man to other men and all men together to nature; and (c) method inventions, which are forms of neuro-psychic technique, ranging in content from simple habits to complex scientific laws and formuals, which aid man in interpreting and controlling his relation to his physical and social environments. 2. The Sources of invention are in the nature of the inventor (hands, brain, and speech) and in the nature of his environment (models, materials, forces). 3. The process of inventing is empirical and by scientific projection, most important modern inventions being of the latter type. An empirical invention is chiefly by direct copy, while a projected invention is by indirect copy. 4. Social progress is secured through inventions of the foregoing three types, and the method or scientific invention is preliminary to the highest degree of progress in physical and social inventions. 5. There are six major fields for future inventions: production, conservation, eugenics, euthenics, distribution, social organization.",

That is, the apparatus of third person reflexive (or fourth person) verb endings is not used 1 In contrast to constructions built on the connective (or relative) verb moods, expressing causation, coincidence in time, contingency, etc., where reflexive third person endings on the dependent mood are obligatorily used to affirm identity with the subject of the main verb, and even more so the subordinative (or appositionalis or conjunctive) verb mood where the subject is obligatorially the same as that of the main verb. .

      "title": "Magic, Sorcery and Witchcraft",
      "abstract": "Magic, sorcery and witchcraft-terms often used interchangeably-fulfill many emotional and practical needs in many cultures. Chiefly, magical thinking is a way of coping with uncertainty-to help abate anxiety by seeking the aid of supernatural forces to help solve problems. Magical ceremonies-for healing, to alter the weather, to produce good crops or a successful hunt, to punish wrongdoers, and so on-are part and parcel of the work of shamans, medicine-men and other healing practitioners. When illness strikes, shamans or other healers will invariably determine, before anything else, whether the patient has been subjected to witchcraft. Magical techniques are omnipresent in conventional religions of the world-gifts, offerings, or sacrifices, lighting candles, kissing icons. Magic is rightly feared because it can be used for antisocial or disruptive purposes-to cause illness, death, accidents or misfortune in others. Often the mere threat of sorcery or making known that sorcery has been practiced makes it surprisingly easy to settle a quarrel. A magical spell is said to work through the law of contagion-involving some “essence” or bodily residue of the victim, such as nail clippings, hair, food leavings, an article of clothing, etc. The spell works through the particular medium utilized so as to affect the victim. In many cultures people take great care not to leave nail clippings, hair or food leftovers where any enemy might utilize them for sorcery. It is commonly thought that the victim of witchcraft may well “deserve” the hex as just desserts for some transgression, such as refusal to pay a legitimate debt, unprovoked aggression, or a breach of charity or neighborliness. Accusations of witchcraft in cases of death or illness, may lead to a feud between the victim and the sorcerer, resulting in countermeasures or blood revenge. During the witchcraft trials of Europe, England and the American colonies, people believed that witches were in liege with the Devil, who in turn granted them powers to harm others. In many cultures, vampires and zombies are thought to be real entities. The belief in witchcraft is widespread in modern cultures-people will seek potions, candles and spells to help produce financial success, jobs or other good luck, or one can hire a witch or sorcerer for various intentions such as to attract love, to mend family problems, to cure addictions, to offer help in business, etc. Occult supply stores are found in every urban center selling magical robes, potions, herbs, books, incense, and talismans. In the Southern United States a “hexing culture” is widely prevalent.",

      "title": "Semantic and discourse constraints on Chinese Bei-passives",
      "abstract": "The semantic function of the ? bei passive sentence has been characterized in various ways. It has been claimed by some scholars that its primary function is to indicate that the referent of the subject, the speaker or the hearer is adversely affected by the action, event or state represented in the sentence. It has also been claimed that the construction can sometimes be used neutrally, without any adversity implications. It has further been claimed that it can sometimes be used with positive implications. But little attempt has been made in the past to show exactly when the construction acquires which of these three implications (i.e., adversative, neutral, and positive). This paper attempts to answer that question. It proposes that the semantic/discourse function of the bei-passive sentence is to indicate that the referent of the subject, the speaker (or the person whose point of view (s)he is representing) or the hearer receives a major impact which is above a certain threshold from the action, event, or state represented in the sentence. The impact can be either direct, as is the case with high-impact verbs (e.g., ? da ‘hit’, ?? kaichu ‘fire’), indirect (as is the case with low or no impact verbs such as ?? kanjian ‘see’, ? hen ‘hate’), or both. It shows that a generalization that is based on ‘EITHER a major direct impact OR a major indirect impact’ does not work. It proposes that the semantic/discourse function of the bei-passive sentence is to indicate that the SUM of the direct and indirect impacts that the referent of the subject, the speaker (or the person whose point of view (s)he is representing) or the hearer receives is at or above the threshold for a major impact.",

When they are considered as his own, then is he called a natural person: and when they are considered as representing the words and actions of another, then is he a feigned or artificial person. 1 Hobbes' distinction between the two forms of personation may serve set forth the common ground, as well as mark the boundary, between two modes of theatricality: the sustaining of a feigned person-or mimicry-and the emphatic maintaining of one's own person, or self-manifestation. The Oxford Dictionary supplies similar coordinates for the verbs and act, which may mean either sustain a feigned character, make a pretence, act deceitfully -i. e., engage in mimicry or hypocrisy -or, more neutrally, pursue a course of action, to perform a function -to go about one's business in a normal manner. A man who has played his part has done what was expected of him; he has fulfilled the obligations contracted by performing similar actions in the past. But most men play their parts somewhat inexpertly; they fail coincide exactly with their assumed roles. And our language contains various expressions of disapproval for those who too grossly misplay themselves. Terms like showing off, playing the gallery, upstaging, making a scene, making a spectacle of oneself, all refer an insistence on being at the center of attention. The same notion appears in other languages: in Italian, for example, sta sempre sul podio -he's always on a platform -refers bitingly the man who cannot do without an audience. To make a spectacle of oneself means that one is affording undesirable amusement others, though not necessarily by de-",

      "title": "Responsibility for Harm to Others: A Brief Survey",
      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on one of Lord Hoffmann’s concerns, responsibility for harm to others. I start from the principle that human beings, like other living creatures, are responsible for the misfortunes that befall them. We all have to cope with what happens to us, and hence to bear the risk of events that befall us. These include such misfortunes as ill-health, loss of property or employment, the death of friends or relatives and similar mishaps. Our need to adapt to risk is a natural form of responsibility, since life rests on the pursuit of continuity by survival or reproduction. This ‘having to cope’ burden is pre-legal. On the other hand we are not normally responsible for the misfortunes that befall others. So our responsibility to others for misfortunes that befall them, when it exists, involves a transfer of this pre-legal burden from the person who suffers the misfortune to another. I then discuss the two main ways in which this transfer, in my view, comes about. The person held responsible for another’s misfortune has either (i) brought about or helped to bring about the event for which he is held responsible, or (ii) bears the risk of having to cope with or answer for that event.",

      "title": "Less Trust Means More Trusts",
      "abstract": "The word “trust” has multiple meanings. In everyday speech, it refers to a feeling of confidence associated with integrity, such as trusting that a friend will keep a secret. In the financial context, some law students, lawyers and lucky individuals also understand that a trust is a near-magical device that splits legal and equitable title. A trustee holds formal legal title to property for the benefit of a beneficiary simply because the grantor declares it to be so. By turning the spotlight on “trust,” in both senses of the world, one can discern fault lines in contemporary U.S. political and legal structures. These are made even plainer when examined through the lens of ongoing litigation involving human embryos created by actress Sofia Vergara and her former fiancé. Just as termites can enter homes through foundational cracks or wood brought from the outside, interpersonal, community or structural confidence may erode in the face of hostility, indifference or inequality. Similarly, as termites can slowly damage a home over a period of years before the harm becomes visible, the beneficial form of ownership known as a trust gradually – and then suddenly – has morphed almost beyond recognition over the last twenty-five years. Eaten away are the traditional limitations on trust duration, trust modification and the type of property that can be held in trust. In some states, irrevocable trusts can last forever, be decanted to another trust with entirely different terms, or even hold legal “title” to human embryos. These changes to centuries of trust law reveal changing attitudes about wealth, property ownership, and personal autonomy. If society truly values equal opportunity for all people, then trust – and trusts – need attention.",

      "abstract": "According to the traditional views of the New Guinea natives sudden violent illnesses, epidemics, disabilities, congenital deformities, mental handicaps, accidents, violent deaths are most of the times being ascribed to actions of the supernatural forces, usually to ghosts and magic. Only the slight wounds and insufficient functions weaknesses if their physical base was evident, suicide, senile or death at war (although not always) were considered as \"natural\". According to the natives, breach of common law granted by the supernatural, especially of taboo is the basic cause of sickness and death. The diagnosis and treatment of the patient is carried in accordance with this concept. Quacks start with trying to establish the \"actual\" cause of sickness or death; often the blame is attributed to effect of destructive magic of several kinds. Especially dangerous is the so called \"death spell\", particularly the one connected with \"poisoning\" or \"destruction of interior\" by a witch or wizard. On the basis of established cause the quack applies treatment consisting usually of many elements. At first the actual cause is to be removed, i.e. the sick person has to undo the damage he made or ease the wrath of the supernatural and, if need be, the soul of the patient which got lost or was abducted has to be found. Sometimes the wizard who cast the spell has to be identified and made to give an antidote to the sick person. Occasionally the quack extracted the foreign body from the body of a sick person. Customarily the sick person received also the multi-component curing specimen consisting of, among others, herbs of great curing effect. The composition of those specimens, especially of antidote for \"magic poisons\" is kept secret.",

Reputation is the current standing the person has gained from previous actions or refusal of actions in helping others. Human dignity is the basic element amongst other human rights and thus right to reputation comes under the basic inalienable right to enjoy a decent and dignified life. Defamation laws enables an individual to keep his reputation whenever it is attacked by other person. Defamation occur in two ways, libel or slander, where both are detrimental to a person's reputation.

What has been mentioned about these terms in Buddhism? In Buddhism, it has been cited that moral duty is the cause that leads to the moral rights as result. When we act the right as well as decent things, we are entitled to get the fair deals in return. We used to forget to consider that, isn't our moral duty or not?, to just either pay respect to the other people's rights or simply protect the other people's rights. Regarding to the Buddhism religion, there are a certain criteria to be \"Good guys\" i.e. firstly, not to make any sin at all such as not to exploit the others physically, verbally and mentally. Secondly, to make merits, such as helping out; showing the mercy and kindness to the underprivileged; donating money, land and properties, or even sharing the justified idea is also included. We also forgot to ask about tempting the others with a certain of hindrance i.e. assets, land and properties. Have you already made the sin with these temptations or dominating the idea of people? How the people will understand the fine line between the sin and meritorious deed? Buddhism kindly advises us to understand and consider the real world in two steps as well as in parallel way. Looking around us as surrounding of illusion. These illusion or fantasies will not be sustainable, only temporarily indeed. For example, human being has to go through aging process, illness and eventually death. What we need to consider in parallel is the matter about \"Within us\". What is the secret issue about \"Within us\"? Brain, spirit, heart or extremities, wherever we point at, will be just only human biological tissues or various elements. Last, but not least, practicing salvation when you still alive is perplexing. Live salvation is already existed within us, nowadays. No need to wait for the next life. Salvation can exist when we still alive. Salvation is to purify our spirit which require proper training to keep it clean in sustainable way.",

Gottwald on His Sixty-Fifth Birthday, p. 148 [cited under New Testament: The Evil Eye and John H. Elliot]). This belief has been referred to by many names: ayin ha-ra (Hebrew), baskaino (and related terms, Greek), invidia or fascinus (Latin), ‘ayn (Arabic), mal occhio (Italian), mal de ojo (Spanish), böser Blick (German), and so forth. However, it is commonly referred to in English as the “evil eye.” The belief is typically connected to envy and often emerges in cultures that believe in an extramission theory of vision (see Theoretical Explanations), that is, one in which the eye is understood as an active organ, capable of emitting light from it. Women and outsiders, in particular, are thought capable of casting the evil eye, and those who are beautiful, healthy, wealthy, or young are especially vulnerable to it. Yet, it is believed that individuals can protect themselves against the negative influences of the evil eye by wearing amulets and reciting certain incantations (see, e.g., Gideon Bohak‘s Ancient Jewish Magic: A History [cited under Ancient Near East], E. A. Wallis Budge‘s “The Evil Eye” in Amulets and Superstitions [cited under General Overviews: Classic Overviews], Christopher A. Faraone‘s “The Amuletic Design of the Mithraic Bull-Wounding Scene\" and James Russell‘s “The Archaeological Context of Magic in the Early Byzantine Period” [both cited under Greece and Rome: Artistic and Archaeological Representations], James N. Ford‘s “Ninety-Nine by the Evil Eye and One from Natural Causes: KTU2 1.96 in its Near Eastern Context\" [cited under Ancient Near East]. The scholarly study of the evil eye is vast. Siegried Seligmann‘s Die Zauberkraft des Auges und das Berufen: Ein Kapital aus der Geschichte des Aberglaubens, a classic survey (cited under General Overviews: Classic Overviews), lists more than 2,100 scholarly treatments, and, today, more than three thousand separate examinations of the phenomenon are found around the world. This article thus provides a selective list of relevant scholarship on the evil eye belief in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, the New Testament, Rabbinic Literature, and Early Christian Literature. Views from the Ancient Near East and Greece and Rome on the evil eye are included as background for the belief in biblical communities, as is a survey of scholarly explanations (Theoretical Explanations) for the belief around the world. Since a growing number of scholars are interested in the relationship among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, scholarship on the evil eye belief in Islam is also included. The relevance of the belief for the history of Biblical Reception is also noted.",

      "abstract": "The following words will be an attempt to analyse the cause of the Cartesian Doubt, which, in our opinion, still lives as an intellectual disease in some of the noblest minds of our age. 1. It is our conviction that the universe and man are wholes or unities. Indeed each in its own way and both when united are such wholes or unities that any separation of a part is fatal to the whole. To exemplify: the laws of ethics will be found to be, in the end, sound economic laws. Theft, if not repressed by a commonwealth, will in the end destroy the commonwealth. Or again, the laws of mathematics, if denied, will mean the denial of the laws of psychology. Or the denial of ‘Thou shat not commit adultery’ will spread contagious disease. Or again, voluntary individual poverty will increase communal wealth. 2. Moreover, as man is a moral unity as well as an intellectual unity, man’s intellectual acts may be moral acts. Hence what is intellectually possible may be morally wrong; even as some acts, such as deliberate drunkenness, which are physically possible, may be intellectually harmful. 3. Man, like every other created being, is an imperfect being. Not only is he imperfect in being but in acting. Moreover, since man can act deliberately some of his defective acts may be deliberate. But as man is master of his deliberate acts by his will, man’s deliberate defective acts, of body or soul, are moral faults. Acts attributable to the will are chargeable to the will.",

Here are two plausible claims: first, it is permissible to do nothing; second, it is wrong to save only one. Joe Horton argues that the combination of these two claims has the implausible implication that if you are not going to save both children, you ought to save neither. This is one instance of what he calls the ALL OR NOTHING PROBLEM. I here present CONDITIONAL PERMISSIONS as the solution. Although saving only one child is wrong, it can be conditionally permissible, that is, permissible given what you are not going to do. You ought to save both children or save neither, but if you are not going to save both, you ought to do the next best thing (save one) or save neither.",

This does not mean, however, that we must accept the world as it is and do nothing, like a quietist or those who follow the ancient ‘lazy reason’ argument. Instead, we must endeavour to follow the ‘presumptive will of God,’ (borrowing the notion of presumption from jurisprudence), that is, our best estimation of God’s goodness and purpose. Also discussed is the meaning of love, which Leibniz defines elsewhere as ‘finding happiness in the perfection of another’. From this, the love we have toward God arises when we contemplate his perfections, and this in turn gives rise to our own happiness.",

This aspect of struggle against lower nature and the war against vice is therefore the depressing but dominant feature of the age; but this does not mean a purely stoical attitude to self-mastery—it is always that ‘charity may the more abound'.",

      "abstract": "There are three lines of approach to the study of the function of cortin the vital hormone of the adrenal cortex; one, through the effects of deprivation, a second through the effects of replacement in deficient subjects, and the third through the action of cortin in normal subjects. The most striking results occur when there is a deficiency of the hormone. In experimental adrenal insufficiency symptoms develop which indicate marked changes in the functions of many tissues of the body. Animals with both adrenals removed not only become fatigued easily when they undertake exercise, but they show a disinclination for exercise. Loss of appetite appears sooner or later, with or without vomiting, and there may be hemorrhages from the mueosa of the alimentary canal or elsewhere. As the animals become worse, they lose interest in their surroundings, finally passing into a state of inertia which verges upon coma or they become easily irritated and may appear irrational (wandering about aimlessly from one place to another without being satisfied anywhere), finally passing into coma, from which they are roused with difficulty. Just preceding or alternating with coma, twitching, heightened motor activity, and even convulsions sometimes occur. The blood urea rises and the blood sugar may fall. Although the changes seem to be coming on gradually, collapse may occur suddenly. In addition to the symptoms described for animals, in man other symptoms evident are pain in the legs, back or abdomen; insomnia and mental depression; poor judgment; failure of memory and lack of cooperation. With the administration of cortin the symptoms tend to disappear in the reverse order of their appearance; coma being replaced by heightened muscular irritability, as shown by increased motor activity, aimless movements, twitching and marked myotatic response to stimuli.",

Five conditions explored what object features elicited gaze‐following behavior in the infants. In one condition, the object was an adult stranger. The other four conditions used a soft, brown, dog‐sized, amorphously‐shaped, asymmetrical novel object that varied along two dimensions theorized as central to the identification of intentional beings: facial features and contingently interactive behavior. Infants shifted their own attentional direction to match the orientation of the actor or object in every condition except the one in which the object lacked both a face and contingently interactive behavior. Infants’‘gaze’‐following behavior in general, therefore, appears to have been driven selectively by a particular configuration of behavioral and morphological characteristics, specifically those theorized as underlying attributions of intentionality rather than attributions of person per se.",

We should not want fine clothes or fine houses, an equipage or livery servants, but for what others will think of us for having or wanting them.

      "abstract": "Curanderismo is a diverse folk healing system of Latin America. Eight major philosophical premises underlie a coherent curing world view of Latino patients: disease or illness may follow (1) strong emotional states (such as rage, fear, envy or mourning of painful loss) or (2) being out of balance or harmony with one's environment; (3) a patient is often the innocent victim of malevolent forces; (4) the soul may become separated from the body (loss of soul); (5) cure requires the participation of the entire family; (6) the natural world is not always distinguishable from the supernatural; (7) sickness often serves the social function, through increased attention and rallying of the family around a patient, of reestablishing a sense of belonging (resocialization) and (8) Latinos respond better to an open interaction with their healer. These nuclear ideas or attitudes about health, illness and care are culturally patterned and are both conscious and unconscious (implicit). Moreover, expectations of the nature of the patient-healer relationship have implications for medical practice in general and psychotherapy in particular.",

      "abstract": "Every individual experience a variety of different emotions during a lifetime. This can range from feelings of happiness, anger, love, jealously, pity, sadness, agony, hate and others. Emotion is what provides individuals with a sense of being alive. They are a response to life’s experiences and situations that we encounter through a combination of feelings, thoughts, and action. They constitute towards human behavior and to a certain extent ethical behavior is based on emotion (Goleman, 1995). Human emotion can be separated into two categories including positive emotion and negative emotion that is further accompanied by both physiological and psychological changes. Positive emotions help us to develop joy, interest, gratitude, love in which the person always feel good and remains active with physiological and psychological state of mind. However, when we have negative vibes around then the physiological and psychological state of mind can lead to changes in body gestures, facial expressions, movement of the muscles. In addition, non-voluntary reactions like changes in heat rate, increased pulse rate, high blood pressure and perspiration. The effects of negative emotions always weaken your body’s immune system and give you stress, anxious, or upset and lead to demotivation. The demotivation factor will take you loneliness, frustration, anger, emptiness, fear etc. So, one of the best ways to live life positively is to control our emotions by learning and developing Emotional Intelligence in our life.",

      "title": "Activity verbs and sentences",
      "abstract": "The change of state verbs analyzed in the previous chapter all refer to situations in which an object or event undergoes some change of state or transformation with well-defined beginning and end points. Formal representation of these words involved depicting the state of the object at an initial “moment of attention” followed by its state at subsequent, including terminal, moments of attention. On the other hand, a second very broad class of verbs involves not the transformations of objects but the actions people and other animate beings perform – actions such as seeing, running, throwing, waving, licking, crying, and loving. These words have as their underlying conceptual situations not object states but bodily or psychological states and motions. Further, although these activities do take place in time, they do not'rely crucially on a well-defined sequence of states with characteristic beginning and end points: Running and seeing have durations but not well-defined initial and final states. In general, when the child “moves” or “gives” something, she is focusing on the object and its transformation, and many different specific actions may effect the change of state; when the child “sees” or “touches” something, she is naming the specific action she is actually performing, and the effect on the object is in the background. These two classes of verbs have been identified and analyzed by a number of linguists (e.g., Foley & van Valin, 1984) as well as some developmental psycholinguists (e.g., Edwards, 1973; Huttenlocher, Smiley, & Charney, 1983).",

However, based on the principle of legality and the difficulty of proving, acts of witchcraft (santet) cannot be criminalized so it is not uncommon for people accused of being witchcraft (santet) to due of process of law. To analyze and understand the offense of witchcraft (santet) in the construction of the Draft Bill of the Criminal Code, this study utilizes normative legal research methods whose data are obtained through a literature study. The results showed that witchcraft (santet) as a criminal act was constructed into the category of the formal offense whose proof did not lead to the presence or absence of magical power possessed by someone, but criminalized was a criminal offense committed, namely a person who intentionally announced he had supernatural powers, offered his services in undertaking harm to others in the form of illness, death or mental or physical suffering.",

      "title": "VI. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RELEVANCE",
      "abstract": "T F at some time a person's conduct can make -* the whole difference between probability = 0 and probability = 1 for the obtaining of some state of affairs S, then his conduct is relevant to (the obtaining of) S; or, as I shall sometimes say for short, he is relevant to S. One can also be rele? vant to S through affecting its probability less drastically than that. Everything I say here can take in that territory as well, but it is helpful to think mainly in terms of all-or-nothing relevance. A state of affairs may obtain (1) because some? body did such and such, or (2) because he did not do so and so. For example, the gate at the railway crossing was open (1) because he opened it, or (2) because he didn't close it. (2) doesn't apply unless he could have closed it: the Emperor of Japan didn't open the gate and couldn't have closed it, and so his conduct was not relevant at all to its being open. But I don't confine (2) to people who ought to have prevented S, or who had some duty or obligation to prevent it, or anything like that. I take someone's conduct to be negatively relevant to the gate's being open just so long as he could have closed it and didn't. That makes each of us negatively relevant to millions of states of affairs. But why not? I have been told: is not useful to make the notion of as weak as that. We should at least build into it that the person knew he could prevent S from obtaining. But if we do, we'll make some important truths harder to say, and thus harder to see. If I didn't know that I could have closed the gate, that may excuse me; and if I didn't know I was opening it, that may excuse me. It won't be easy to compare those two excuses if we work with a concept of ac? cording to which a person is not negatively rele? vant to S unless he does know what his conduct is leading to. It may be objected that the ignorance excuse falls very unevenly across the positive/neg? ative divide, being available a million times on the side for every one on the positive. But that doesn't mean that comparisons are not worth making; and in any case, you can't even state that objection without using negative relevance in my way. If we refuse to call someone's conduct negatively relevant to S unless he knew that he could make the difference to whether S obtained or not, we shall be definitionally abolishing the ex? cuse He was negatively relevant, but he didn't know, stamping into the ground an interesting and perhaps important difference between the two sorts of relevance. Similarly for the suggestion that we shouldn't call someone negatively relevant to S's obtaining unless it was his job to prevent it. We ought to be able to compare how the plea was not his spe? cial responsibility works on the side of the line with how it works on the positive side; but for that we need a concept of which allows the plea to arise on that side of the line.",

      "title": "Virtues of Theft: Andre Techine's Thieves",
      "abstract": "truth behind this, which we are all so quick to disavow, is that man is not a gentle creature who retaliates only when attacked. Part of his instinctive nature is a large dose of aggressiveness. His neighbor is not only a potential helper or sexual object but an object of temptation. Man is tempted to satisfy his need for aggression at his neighbor's expense--to exploit him at work, take advantage of him sexually, plunder and manipulate him, torture and kill him. It is precisely because your neighbor is not worthy of love and is, in fact your enemy, that you must love him as yourself. Marie LeBlanc/Catherine Deneuve in Thieves Analysis shows that a relation (always social) determines its terms, and not reverse, and that each individual is a locus in which an incoherent (and often contradictory) plurality of such relational determinations interact. Moreover, question at hand concerns modes of operation or schemata of action... an operational logic whose models go as far back as age-old ruses of fishes and insects that disguise or transform themselves in order to survive.... The purpose... is.. to bring to light models of action characteristic of users whose status as dominated element in a society (a status that does not mean that they are either passive or docile) is concealed by euphemistic term consumers. Everyday life invents itself by poaching in countless ways on property of others. Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life (xi-xii) ACROSS GENRES AND REPUTATIONS, OLD AND NEW, THIS year's French cinema has feasted on thieves of many varieties. Claude Chabrol's rebellious pair in La Ceremonie are most obvious, stealing clothes or mail for spite, but stealing rifles for firearms, in their protest against subjugation and hypocrisy. Claire Denis' lonely adolescent in her ingeniously impressionistic Nenette et Boni kidnaps a baby that not only brings to life stolen affection of his fantasies but serves as a sign of faith in his sister and their mutual love. In Gilles Mimouni's L'Appartement, an homage to Hitchcock and Hollywood classics, a young woman appropriates her friend's persona--her image, name, and habitat--to steal a relationship with man pursuing her. Claude Lelouch's romanticly stylish Men, Women: User's Manual presents a female doctor who steals and redirects confidential medical information between two patients to retaliate against fearless male connivance that resurfaces heroically. And in Ismael Ferroukhi's L'lnconnu, Catherine Deneuve simply steals a chance moment with the unknown that is pure poetry. The results of all these thefts, real and symbolic, are imaginative and heartwarming. I would like to add to this mere fragment of a list Andre Techine's Thieves (Les Voleurs), which shows us how cinema can serve as a formal model, a parallel process, for our emotional development in life. In mid-1990s Techine is one who appears to be making films more because he had much to say than because he has particularly cinematic ways of saying it. His screenplays, dense with verbiage, are demanding vehicles for some of best French actors today because his characters emerge as increasingly complex with their own inherent contradictions. They are familiar and surprising at once, often baffling but compelling as they steer us into morality mazes of our everyday behaviors. Their depth is all more reason that we are content to view Thieves (1995) as an astute investigation of sociopathologies taken up in best of gangster and detective films, mysteries and films noirs. Yet trying to dismantle Thieves is like pulling angel hair from needles of an evergreen tree: successive attempts at separate branches reveal task to be prickly at best and seemingly futile, given inseparability of fibers from form they cling to and from each other as well. Hardly a person or situation in film is autonomous or insignificant, just as in our everyday world we are constantly playing out, in our various relations, conflicts derived from earlier and adjacent ones. …",

      "abstract": "We often talk of man as a being capable of making alternative choices i.e. of having the power to choose between alternative courses of action particularly after careful deliberation. We also notice that at times a man abandon a course of action say a religion for another. We are also found of blaming or praising people, punishing or rewarding people, discouraging or encouraging people. At other time, laws are enacted that may urge people to take certain actions and forbid them to take other actions. Whenever any and, or all of these things are done, the underlined assumption is that man has freedom of the will. On the other hand, it could sometime be argued that a man who does things in a certain way could not have done otherwise. At times the observation could be that certain persons behave in ways and manners dictated by orientation background, their economic beliefs or their religious upbringing. We also notice the element of environmental influences in people's behaviour. This state of affairs sometime make us to wonder whether we are really free moral agents or whether our actions are not after all determined by forces and circumstances beyond our control. In this paper while it is recognized that human actions could be determined, the paper submits that man has the free will to choose the course of the action he likes and he, at the same time bears responsibility for all his actions.African Journal of Cross-Cultural psychology and sport facilitation (AJCPSF) Vol. 9 2007: pp. 26-36",

      "abstract": "The author was a mathematician and an engineer. His view of longevity is similar to his past experience on designing and building a structure or a machine which he calls an “object”. The expected lifespan of an object is similar to the longevity of a human being based on the following three factors: (1) The availability of good and strong building materials that are similar to the genetic factors of a human body health conditions. (2) The engineering design and site construction of this object are similar to the lifestyle, life-long habits, and environmental factors which are related to the health of the human body. (3) The building’s damaged cracks or the machine’s malfunctioned parts under external forces are similar to the medical conditions and symptoms of disease in the human body. If the object suffers from operational problems due to external forces that is similar to the human body being affected by various diseases, then we can repair the object such as adopting the reinforcement of the building structural part or replacing the operational part of the machine. They are similar to the medical treatments including medication interventions, different surgeries, or organ transplants. Once the author understood the analogy and similarity between an engineering object and a human body, he can then distinguish the differences among genetic reason, lifestyle maintenance, disease control, and medical treatments. It is extremely difficult, almost impossible at present time, to change our genes because we cannot select our biological parents; however, we can focus on our daily lifestyle management to either prevent from having diseases or controlling the progression of existing diseases.",

      "abstract": "I. INTRODUCTION II. AUTONOMY IN END-OF-LIFE DECISION-MAKING III. JUDICIAL RESPONSE: FALSE AUTONOMY A. In re Quinlan B. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of Health C. Schindler v. Schiavo IV. LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE: FORMALIZING SUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT AND BEST INTERESTS V. TOWARDS TRUE AUTONOMY I. INTRODUCTION The dawn of the twenty-first century brought with it a profound change in the way we experience death. Until the last decades of the twentieth century, our bodies died all at once: when the heart, kidneys, lungs, or brain failed, the body's other organs failed with them. Modern medicine now allows us to die in pieces, with failing organs supported or supplanted by technology. (1) Modern death is different not only biologically, but also sociologically. Until the twentieth century, death was a private event that took place in the home with the family. (2) It offered one final opportunity for family members and friends to engage with loving care, to forgive and ask forgiveness, and to relive life events, great and small. (3) Today, death takes place mostly in the hospital, in sterile rooms full of expensive machinery, with patients who are drugged, unconscious, hooked up to machines and unable to speak--even if their bodies were still capable of doing so. Doctors, lawyers, nurses, social workers, ethicists, and family members enter a complex dynamic as treatment decisions are made for the unconscious patient, and therapies are applied or refused. (4) Approximately every ten years, (5) a high-profile legal dispute emerges. These disputes pit families, doctors, and elected officials against each other as they seek to resolve ultimate questions of when life ends and death begins. (6) These issues include questions of whether suffering and pain may justify the termination of patient treatment; whether actively terminating a human life is ever acceptable; (7) and whether anyone can determine the proper role of individual autonomy when it conflicts with community values. (8) While the debates ebb and flow, millions of ordinary families are forced to confront these issues quietly on their own. (9) Unfortunately, current policies governing end-of-life decision-making fail these families in the most fundamental ways and fail to achieve their most basic objectives. In the thirty years since the seminal hi re Quinlan case, personal autonomy has been universally acknowledged as the most important value in the end-of-life process. (10) A consensus has emerged that decisions at the end-of-life are the type of personal, individual choices that can only be made by the affected individual in a pluralistic society such as our own. (11) However, while paying lip service to the value of personal autonomy, courts and legislatures have in fact been imposing their own values and those of family members and close personal friends on the dying process. As a result, dying patients rarely take true control over the decisions in their own dying process. While the modern process of dying fails to protect the autonomy of dying patients, it affirmatively places an exceptional and unfair burden on their family members. When they face shock, grief, pain, and uncertainty, family members are often called upon to make profound life-and-death decisions that they have no desire or competence to make, and they must typically make them in a foreign environment and on a moment's notice. (12) Considering that physicians are integrally involved in end-of-life decisions, this article discusses a new paradigm that would place on physicians the responsibility to elicit from their patients the moral guidelines that would govern end-of-life decision-making. In the event a patient later became incapacitated, the physician would be responsible to apply these moral guidelines to actual treatment decisions. Part II of this article examines the central role that the ethic of personal autonomy plays in end-of-life decision-making. …",

      "abstract": "A psychiatrist who designates behavior as disordered, deviant, or sick and identifies the antecedent social conditions of such behavior 'as stressful, dtsorganized, or disintegrated necessarily and properly makes value judgments. However considered, sympathetic, well-intentioned, and technically couched his opinions may be, he judges some behavior and its attendant circumstances to be less desirable than others. Whether a clinical psychiatrist asks himself in which readymade disease category the symptoms fit or, in the manner of the existential psychiatrist, he attempts to understand the behavior from the patient's inner world-that is, deals with the situation the patient confronts and the goals toward which 1.J.e is striving the psychiatrist sees something undesirable in the goals which the other person pursues. Or else, he sees the patient's means of striving, the inordinately great or miniscule amount of energy he expends in adaptation, his emotionally inappropriate tone of behavior, or the character of his relationship with other people to be somehow wrong. Just as the law sees a lawbreaker deviating from legal norms, the psychiatrist , views his patient to be deviant with respect to some ideal pattern which may be left unvoiced or inexplicit. My object is not to question the propriety of such professional judgments but to determine what might be called their social basis and to call attention to certain consequences that follow.",

      "abstract": "Induction – reasoning to uncertain conclusions – appears in many forms. In some cases one makes an uncertain inference about a specific object or event. Given a particular dog, one asks whether it is safe to pet it; given a particular berry, one asks if it is safe to eat it (e.g., see Chapter 8 by Murphy & Ross, this volume). But in other cases one makes inductive generalizations that are intended to characterize an entire class of situations or objects. On the basis of a finite number of medical cases, one might induce a general causal law, such as that unsafe sex can cause AIDS or that mosquitoes can cause malaria. Or, from a few examples one might make a generalization about a property being displayed by many or most members of a particular category, such as that koalas eat bamboo, Apple laptops have fire-prone batteries, or Madagascar Fire Ants have poisonous venom. This chapter is concerned with category based generalizations such as these in which new properties are projected to an entire class of objects.",

      "abstract": "At beginning of development of my thesis it is necessary to determine that homicide is an act or omission that consists of depriving life to another person that can be presented in an intentional or guilty way. The term etymologically comes from Latin homicidium a component of homo being, and caedere, to kill a human being. This is a reprehensible conduct which shows that it is typical, unlawful and therefore guilty except in cases that arise from an accusation that accused is not guilty, but responsible if criminal, residing in attempting against legal good life of a person physical.\r\nHomicide is considered as a typical, unlawful, guilty conduct against protected legal life, which can be perpetrated to detriment of a natural or natural person, leaving aside those deaths that were produced and are not legally susceptible Of penal sanction, for being considered reasonable as are self-defense; Or, similarly when killed by mandate of law, (lethal injection euthanasia).\r\nThe homicide is to go against legal good protected in human life and its transcendence is total not only because attack against it is irreparable, but likewise life is indispensable condition to enjoy its greatness and enjoy others Legal rights. Hence Codes that establish serious penalties to repression of this fact are demolished. The manifested means that there is an interest of State, for security of its inhabitants and through a demographic configuration. Homicide is an immediate crime of public action, of material damage and can be perpetrated by action or omission.\r\nIn Latin, this crime is called homicidium, Vanini who uses concept of Carmignani: the death of a man is produced by illegitimate behavior of another man.\r\nWriting about homicide and murder will always be difficult as it is a complex issue, which runs counter to our own conservation instincts. In any case, we need to analyze homicide because it is an essential part of our existence which aims to discover improvements and solutions that impose sanctions will always be beneficial. I will go in search of a legal proposal and detailed study of crimes and their circumstances in relation to: criminal responsibility; Human criminal behavior, criminal type, active subject, and passive; With respect to murder, murder and manslaughter.\r\nI will carefully analyze articles included in previous Repealed Criminal Code and current Integral Criminal Code in relation to criminal type and its responsibility; In crimes of murder, homicide and manslaughter. Cesar Bonezana Beccaria: If you want to prevent crime, make lights accompany freedom.\r\nAnalyze different kinds of types within theory of crime, their respective objective imputation, definitions of fraud and guilt of different writers of law, constitute a legal definition in subject that is responsible for Type and its Criminal Responsibility.\r\nWe will present a proposal for legal reform comprised in criminal type and in each of elements that comprise it, from an analytical, concise doctrinal and legal perspective; In which we will focus on protection of legal good life, as a right that can not be violated.\r\nWe can indicate within characteristics of academic aspect determination within Criminal Law to analyze following aspects, within crime of homicide as a subject of learning and application.\r\nSubstantive Law.- In relation to Substantive Law are legal rules that are responsible for analyzing crime, offender, victim, sentence and respective security measures.\r\nLaw Adjective.- Criminal Law Adjective Instrumental are rules that are in charge of executing Substantive Law.\r\nThe difference with first is rule executable to offender, penalty or security measure and second is how to apply it.\r\nFundamentally we intend to determine measures in area of Criminal Law (Jus puniendi, Punitive State Law), which as a concept is set of legal rules that regulate behavior, since Criminal Law is a clearly sanctioning and preventive rule that governs within A state. As a finality we will analyze Theory of crime in terms of its Types. We will describe in detail elements of homicide as a criminal type that demands to be analyzed, as a punishable conduct that damages legal good life.

      "title": "Whose Sati?: Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India",
      "abstract": "Whose Sati? Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India Anand A. Yang Intentionally interrogatory, the title of this essay emphasizes the speculative nature of my remarks regarding the phenomenon of sati. Derived from the Sanskrit term for pure or chaste (sef)—the very term \"sati,\" therefore, is a misnomer—sati has come to signify both the act of immolation of a wife on the funeral pyre of her husband (in some areas a widow was buried with her deceased husband or took poison) and the victim herself rather than its original meaning of \"a virtuous woman.\"1 Generally, a woman was burnt together with her deceased husband, a practice termed sahamarana or sahagamana (dying together with). But if concremation was not possible, such as when a husband died in a distant place or a woman's pregnancy required that she wait till after delivery, a sati conformed to the practice of anumarana or anugamana: burning with the husband's ashes or with some other memento representing him, for example, his sandals, turban, or piece of clothing. * The title also has another meaning, a double trajectory: an interrogation of the historical literature on the subject and an interrogation of sati as a practice involving women of different times, places, and backgrounds. Both lines of inquiry seek to converge on the same objective: better questions and answers regarding the phenomenon of sati. Hitherto, much of the literature on sati has tended to favor an institutional approach.3 Not surprisingly, the most familiar aspect of sati is the British campaign against it culminating in the promulgation of Regulation XVII in 1829 \"declaring the practice of suttee, or of burning or burying alive the widows of Hindus, illegal and punishable by the criminal courts.\"4 Viewed from this angle, the history of sati has been appropriated by some scholars to represent the beginnings of \"a deliberate policy of modernizing and westernizing Indian society,\" as embodied in the person and policies of Governor-General Lord Bentinck who directed the official campaign against sati, and in the emergence of a Bengal \"Renaissance\" under the guiding hand of the \"Father of Modern India,\" Raja Rammohun Roy, who acted as the Indian architect of this and other social reforms.s The legislative prohibition of sati has also \"become a founding moment in the history of women in modern India.\" To continue in the words of this scholar, colonial rule, with its moral civilizing claims, is said to have provided the contexts for a thoroughgoing re-evaluation of Indian \"tradition\" along lines more consonant with the \"modern\" economy and society ©1989 Journal of Women-s History, Vol. ι No. 2 (Fall)____________________ 1989 Anand A. Yang believed to have been the consequence of India's incorporation into the capitalist world system. In other words, even the most antiimperialist amongst us has felt forced to acknowledge the \"positive\" consequences of colonial rule for certain aspects of women's lives, if not in terms of actual practice, at least at the level of ideas about \"women's rights.\"6 But as Lata Mani's deconstruction of the colonial discourse on sati reveals, women were neither the subjects nor the objects of this discourse, \"but rather the grounds of the discourse on sati .... For the British, rescuing women becomes part of the civilizing mission. For the indigenous elite, protection of their status or its reform becomes an urgent necessity, in terms of the honor of the collective—religious or national.\"7 For the political and ideological context in which the government campaign for social reforms was waged, whether focusing on sati, infanticide , lhagi (ritual murder), or human sacrifice, aimed at entitling the British with the right to proclaim the superiority of their own values, and ultimately , to justify their right to rule. Only they could usher in the morality they found wanting in the indigenous civilization. Consider the tenor of the following government pronouncement on sati: Of the rite itself, of its horror and abomination not a word need be said. Every rational and civilized being must feel anxious for the termination of a practice so abhorrent from humanity. . . . But to the christian and to the Englishman, who by tolerating sanctions, and by...",

      "abstract": "The human person has, whether in act or potency, has intelligence to perform abstract operations; a will which can love, and freedom to determinate what to do or not to (or not to do at all). These characteristics, inherent to human person’s being, are derived of the substantial unity of spiritual soul and body, and they bestow human beings with a special dignity, which must be reflected in the way each one assumes his or her own existence, and how he/she is treated and respected by others. Indeed, the human person’s dignity confers personal rights and duties, among which is found, in a preeminent place, the unconditioned respect to every innocent human life (one’s one as well as others’). Therefore, the human being’s death and its surrounding period demand profound respect and to be treated according to such dignity, which allows every one to face this step with a maximum of decorum and integrity. While euthanasia represents a manner of facing death which disclaims human life’s inviolability and, hence, attempts against the human person’s dignity, on the other hand, palliative care counts nowadays with very efficacious tools to alleviate suffering and to attend human beings in this crucial step of life in consonance with the dignity of which they are endowed.",

Although most social scientists have an intuitive sense of what constitutes a riot, the edges of the definition are fuzzy and it can be difficult to determine whether or not some events are actually riots. For example, it is agreed that a riot is a collective act. That is, more than one individual must be involved and at least minimally coordinate action in order for a riot to occur. Two people acting together, however, would not constitute a riot, even though it is a collective act of violence. Thus, the lower limit for participation, damage, and duration to define a riot is difficult to establish and has led many sociologists to analyze events more ambiguously referred to as civil disorders or collective violence. For most, however, unless there are at least 30–50 people involved, the events last more than a few moments, and there is action that could result in property damage or injury requiring medical attention, a riot has not occurred.",

      "title": "[The comparison of human reflex and instinct behaviour (author's transl)].",
      "abstract": "On the basis of characteristics of the exteroceptive reflexes and of the instincts it was shown that instinct behaviour developed from reflex characteristics (local characteristic of the stimuli, pos. and neg. taxis, habituation, conditioning). Most similarities are found between reflex and avoidance instinct behaviour (instincts for excretion, thermoregulation, body care, pain avoidance and safety). Except the safety instinct, all others react on stimuli, characterised by the localisation of the receptors. In the safety instinct the structure of the stimulus becomes important, together with the growing importance of the third dimension. This instinct shows also for the first time a variability of the threshold with spontaneous remaining low for some time after stimulation of the system. Inverse the gain instincts (nutrition, sex and social instinct). Here the threshold falls spontaneously, when stimuli are lacking and raises, when stimuli are found. The spontaneous motor expression of the lowering of the threshold is the appetite behaviour. It means seeking stimuli, which will be gained by elements of the initial and terminal success behaviour. The successfull nutritional and sexual behaviour is stopped by success inhibition, whereas the social instinct remains in the terminal success behaviour with group dynamic hierarchy, with imitating and helping behaviour. Overchanging of the gain instincts provokes avoidance behaviour with constant threshold. The neural systems of most reflexes lie distributed in the spinal cord and brainstem, the ones of the instincts in the limbic part of the brain, the nutrition and sex instinct with a hypothalamic pacemaker. Simultaneous activation of two or many instinct motivation systems result, not comparable with the direct reflex interaction, in interactions on the level of the global interaction, in interactions on the level of the global integration (summation, mixture, synthesis, rest, oscillation, intention) which projects the activity patterns via the motor cortex to the peripheral neurons. There it is completed by the reflexes. The hormonal and vegetative projection instead go directly to the end organs. The motivation is responsible for the subjective experience, the dominating integration with its motor projection for the instinct behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Physical handicap, especially congenital in origin, threatens our sense of security and raises in us distinct feelings of anxiety. We naturally tend to screen out disturbing stimuli. Visible physical handicap however is not so easy to screen out. In its more extreme forms it affronts our feelings of wholeness. To be brought face to face with physical handicap therefore causes us to want to escape the situation altogether or to dissipate in some way the embarrassment engendered. Our escape takes several forms. We may become over-solicitous for the person confronting us. We may shift attention away by focusing on anything irrelevant. We may become ‘moral’ about disabilty, holding implicit attitudes about the value of suffering. All these evasions provoked by our own attempts to handle our own anxiety make us adopt a ‘false consciousness’ or ‘bad faith’. Bad faith is trying to hide from oneself an unpleasant truth or trying to present as true some pleasing untruth. All children are vulnerable to the ‘bad faith’ practices of adults and these communicate themselves effectively to children. Laing1 writes ‘Other people become a sort of identity kit, whereby one can piece together a picture of oneself’. Questions about who one is are answered for the child by asking others. But these questions are mostly asked implicitly by acting in particular ways and finding out what happens to other people when one does.",

      "abstract": "The development of play passes through the same stages as the mastery of the spatial-concept; starting with the individual self, it extends its activity in concentric circles of an ever-increasing radius. Sometimes the purely play-motive is joined by a feature of something like sport, and the child tries to surpass his own or others' performances: to jump a little higher or farther, to stand still longer on one leg, and to utter louder shouts. The simplest playthings are objects left unchanged in their original form and only used as auxiliary to the aforementioned body-games: as when the child thumps on the table with a lump of wood to satisfy his craving for movement and his hunger for noise-stimulus. The part played by imitation in constructive games is evidently greater in the case of girls than with boys. Some children refused to play poverty of ideas of their own, or incapacity to carry on the game without help from playfellows.",

      "title": "ISTIGFAR THERAPY AS SELF-CONTROL",
      "abstract": "Self-control is one of the personal competencies that every individual needs to have. Good behavior, constructive, and harmony with others are influenced by the individual's ability to control himself. Self-control that is well-developed in individuals will help individuals resist behavior contrary to social norms. Self-control is an individual's ability to inhibit or prevent an impulse from appearing in the form of behavior that violates or is contrary to moral standards. Self-control as organizing, guiding, regulating, and directing forms of behavior that can lead individuals to positive consequences. According to the researcher, istighfar is suitable for the client because of the meaning of asking for forgiveness from all mistakes. The problem experienced by the client is one of the mistakes, namely (cursing at his friends). This Istighfar also mentions that God is the best of human guardians. Someone asks forgiveness from Allah and asks for protection and care to protect him from bad and despicable traits. Istighfar is very important for humans. Not only because humans have a more excellent opportunity to sin, but also because Allah SWT repeatedly commands both through His words in the Qur'an and the mouth of His messenger (Rasulullah SAW).",

The amount of pleasure or displeasure aroused by a given stimulus is not invariable—it depends on the internal state of the stimulated subject. Factors that can modify the internal state and in turn induce alliesthesia are as follows: internal physiological variables (e.g., deep body temperature or body dehydration modify the pleasure of thermal sensation or taste of water); set points (e.g., during fever the body temperature set point is raised and pleasure defends the elevated set point); multiple peripheral stimuli (e.g., mean skin temperature determines the set point for deep body temperature and in turn generates alliesthesia); and past history of the subject (e.g., association of a flavor with a disease or a recovery from disease renders it unpleasant or pleasant). Positive alliesthesia indicates a change to a more pleasurable sensation; negative alliesthesia a change to a less pleasurable one.",

      "abstract": "I. According to the teaching of the Catholic Church, and this teaching is necessarily true, for the Catholic Church teaches with the authority of God Himself, the reason of man’s existence is that he may know, serve and love God. Every activity of man must be directed to those ends, otherwise man is false to himself, for he is acting against his nature, and false to God, for he is acting against his Maker. For such a creature as man, then, the work he does is not primarily that he may earn the food he eats, the shelter he needs and the food and shelter for the children he begets. Food and shelter are not the ends for which man works. On the contrary, man’s work is the end to which food and shelter are the means. We say that man’s work is the end. That is to say, it is the immediate or proximate end. The ultimate end, the final end is God. All food and shelter are things to help man in his work; all work is to help man to his God. Now under the stress of an irreligious and therefore an ill-organised society, these things are forgotten or denied; God Himself is forgotten or denied, and men think of themselves as working merely in order to live. Food and shelter are proclaimed to be the ends for which men work and, being reduced to the level of a means to merely earthly existence, work is degraded and derided. This is indeed the curse of Adam; for Adam sinned when he ceased to contemplate his God.",

Our remembered emotions (memories) are usually rosier than our experienced emotions, and people are motivated by their predicted emotions, which tend to coincide with their emotional memories. This Article advocates that law should care more about experiencing selves than remembering selves if and when experiences result in chronic health or stress consequences that either (1) societies care about more than people do (because of externalities, public bads, or public goods) or (2) people also care about, but are unaware of, do not remember, or are unable to act upon (due to self-control problems). This Article analyzes examples of chronic health or stress effects from such experiences as dense and long commutes, unhealthy eating, lack of regular physical exercise, sedentary behavior, and financial/retirement planning.",

Namun demikian juga Islam melarang seseorang bersikap pasif (hanya diam menunggu), seseorang tidak perlu berduka cita secara berlebihan atas kejadian tidak menyenangkan yang terjadi dalam kehidupannya dan juga tidak perlu merasa bangga secara berlebihan atas keberhasilan yang sudah diraihnya dalam hidup, karena semua itu terjadi atas izin dan kehendak-Nya. \r\nSerta dalam penciptaan manusia ada yang diciptakan sempurna (secara fisik) dan ada yang diciptakan dengan kurang sempurna (cacat fisik), dari cacat fisik tersebut terdapat bermacam-macam bentuk, ada yang tidak memiliki tangan, baik cuma sebelah maupun tidak memiliki tangan sama sakali, ada pula yang memiliki mata hanya sebelah dan masih banyak lagi bentuk-bentuk kecacatan fisik yang lain. Namun yang menjadi perhatian dan yang akan dijadikan subyek penelitian dalam skripsi ini adalah yang memiliki cacat fisik berupa mata (tunanetra). Dan yang akan menjadi pertanyaan awal adalah bisakah mereka mengatasi permasalan kehidupannya baik masalah yang berhubungan dengan lahir (fisik), maupun masalah yang berhubungan dengan kejiwaan mereka. Dalam kenyataanya ada remaja tunanetra yang mampu mempergunakan kesempatan yang ada dengan sebaik-baiknya sehingga ia mampu menyelesaikan gelar Sarjananya, dengan kata lain anak tunanetra yang mampu memanfaatkan kesempatan yang ada ia akan mampu menjadi dirinya sendiri dan hanya dengan kepercayaan diri yang tinggi itu semua dapat terwujud.",

      "abstract": "For property rights to be upheld, people need to be able to judge how ownership is established. Previous research suggests that people may judge that the first person to possess an object establishes ownership over it. This article proposes and tests an alternative account, which claims that people decide who owns an object by judging who was probably necessary for the object to be possessed. Participants read stories in which one character pursues an object (e.g., an animal being hunted, a gem jutting out of a high cliff), which a second character then captures. Judgments about which character owns the object depended on which character was plausibly necessary for capturing the object. The findings support the “necessary for possession” account and suggest that people’s judgments about ownership likely depend on counterfactual reasoning or on processes akin to those used to make judgments about causality.",

      "title": "Explaining Related Concepts and Vocabulary and Identifying Their Connections",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, concepts such as health, mental health, urban health, stress, environmental stress, and urban stress are fully described. Then, the relationships between these concepts and urban stress are identified through content analysis using MAXQDA software. Stress is a social pollutant, an unpleasant emotional state, an unspecific physiological and psychological response to perceived real and imagined threats and stress factors (environmental, social, and behavioral stimuli) to physical, mental, or social integrity, a mechanism preparing us for any reaction (biochemical, physiological, and behavioral response), and also making us evolve and adapt more to the environment. What it causes and what its effects are not always clear. It can be acute (appears suddenly through an unpredictable threat), or chronic (resulting from exposure to repeated threats). Although it is not harmful in general, exposure to chronic stress endangers our physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and social health. It is an acute threat to the homeostasis (steady state) of an organism, which helps its physical and mental well-being. In fact, the nervous system alerts the body by increasing the heart rates and releasing some hormones (adrenaline and cortisol) and the body quickly turns to maximize its power. This automatic process is known as the \"fight-or-flight\" reaction or the \"stress response.\" Urban stress is actually the cumulative stress caused by the experience of living in unfavorable conditions of the urban environment and a general term related to the relationship between the urban environment and its impact on human mental health and a reaction to some threats perceived by undesirable urban events such as pollution, high population, extreme temperature, crowding, noise, destroyed landscape, excessive accumulation of solid waste, waste of time in commuting, etc., and if these conditions are beyond the urbanite's tolerance, he will experience urban stress. The city both directly influences mental health and causes stress through social, economic, physical, environmental, housing, transportation, and individual stressors, and this stress reduces mental health. Of course, the city also influences mental health through the reduction of general or physical health, because the areas of health and mental health are largely interdependent. Mental health also affects the city both directly and through stress and public health. As a result, urban stress and physical health can mediate the effects of urbanization on mental health and the effects of mental health on the city. A better understanding of this relationship and the effect of mediators and trying to reduce the negative effects of cities on mental health will greatly help to best take advantage of urban life.",

      "title": "“Self-Realisation Leads to the God Realisation”",
      "abstract": "Every person’s life is like Kurukshetra; their good qualities are like friends, and their bad qualities are like enemies. Life itself is like a battlefield where we have to make the right decisions to achieve our goals. Seldom does the mind become confused regarding right and wrong, and it wanders; in the meanwhile, we make the wrong decision. As a result, there is a struggle between good and dreadful, false and truth, and true and evil. The term “Dharmakshetra” refers to this. When one is surrounded by unfavourable gesture impressions of the outside world or one’s own physical possessions, the mind is triggered to defend the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. When the mind is surrounded with detrimental gesture impressions of the environment or one’s own belongings, it triggers a lot to sustain the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. Our current field, whether it be tangible or incorporates different facets of life, including the job, family, business, or the social, political, economic, and moral domains in which we are pursuing our vocations, is becoming more and more like “Kurukshetra.” We all need the knowledge that Krishna imparted to Arjuna on the battlefield upon the soul and its features as well as God and his attributes, just as Arjuna required Lord Krishna’s advice in the Gita. Therefore, in order to maintain a peaceful, enjoyable existence free from hardships and ill luck, it is essential to do yoga and to be aware of both God and thyself. We compare the many viewpoints of the Gita via that of Brahma Kumari, who has deep ideas and whose opinions are very identical, in an effort to make the readers feel more secure and conscious of both God and oneself.Similar to this, there are several parallels between the soul, the absolute soul, and yoga, including the Bhagavad-Gita’s philosophical lines and spiritual content. According to the Indian poet and mystic Kabir of the 15th century believed that “(Kudh) ko jano tho khuda ko janenge,”1meaning that “Aatma anubhuti sey Eashwar anubhuti.”Brahmakumaris 2godly version says that “The self is the ultimate reality, and realising it is the key to liberation,” according to the B-Gita. “Tat tvam Asi” 3(you are that) can be seen in the Chandogya Upanishad. Self-realization is the sole path to nirvana, according to Adi Shankaracharya’s4. non-dualism doctrine from the eighth century, “Aham Brahmasmi Advaita Vedanta,” that he laid out in his work Atma Bhoda.",

      "title": "Newton's (Often Misunderstood) Third Law of Motion",
      "abstract": "For every action there is always an opposed equal reaction. That may sound straightforward, but Newton's third law, generally called the law of action and reaction, is the most misunderstood of his three laws of motion. Often Newton's third law is applied inappropriately. For example, the telling of a lie sooner or later elicits another lie in reaction. Treating a friend harshly results in an equal harshness by that friend. What goes around comes around. What you sow is what you reap. True enough, how someone acts socially often has consequent reactions. But these are not examples of Newton's third law. I confront this misconception early so that students will be clear that the third law, like the first and second laws, is about force. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Action and reaction forces make up a single interaction Action and reaction refer to the interaction of forces, which may be gravitational, electrical, magnetic, or any kind of push or pull. If you push on a wall, you are interacting with the wall, which pushes back on you (Figure 1). Every interaction involves a pair of forces: one action and the other reaction. If you pull on a wagon, the wagon pulls back on you. It doesn't matter which force we call action and which we call reaction. Neither force has to be identified as exerter or receiver. Both are equal parts of a single interaction. [FIGURE 2 OMITTED] An inanimate object can exert a force Students may experience disbelief when told that a wall pushes back on them. A widespread misconception is that only live things can push or pull. Not so. I ask students to push the fingers of their hands together. The fingers bend. But they bend just as much when fingers of either hand are pressed to a wall. When you push on something, animate or inanimate, it really does push back just as hard. Action and reaction forces act simultaneously Newton's third law is more precisely stated as: Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. The key word in this definition is whenever, as in the same If you pull on a shopping cart today, and the cart pulls on something else tomorrow, the two pulls do not constitute an action-reaction pair. An action-reaction pair of forces occurs at the same time. When you pull on a cart, the cart pulls back on you simultaneously. These simultaneous forces constitute a single interaction. Action and reaction forces occur in pairs Forces occur only in pairs. Any force by one object on another cannot exist without the existence of an equal and opposite reaction force. A single force without a reaction counterpart does not exist in the world of physics. I repeat this for emphasis: A single force without a reaction counterpart does not exist in the world of physics. Figure 2 illustrates four interactions and the associated action-reaction force pairs. When walking, you interact with the ground. One force, your push backward against the ground, is accompanied by a second force, the ground pushing forward against you. Action and reaction constitute a pair of forces--always. Similarly, the tires of an automobile push back against the road while the road pushes forward on the tires--the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In these examples, reaction forces depend on friction to account for the motion produced. [FIGURE 3 OMITTED] A person or car on ice, for example, may not be able to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force. …",

      "abstract": "There are, or very much appear to be, a number of things in the universe with the following characteristics: they are private to any person who is aware of them in a certain way; they seem very possibly to exist only if someone is aware of them in a certain way; they are not literally constituents of states of consciousness; they are not composed of atoms and molecules but may have some physical characteristics such as shape, spatial location, and color; and they are commonly referred to as something mental. Anything that more or less satisfies these conditions I call a secondary mental entity. Secondary mental entities fall into three moderately distinct subcategories. They are (i) sensations proper such as pains, tickles, and itches; (2) emotions proper such as anger, fear, and exhilaration; and (3) perceptionrelated entities such as sense data, images, and afterimages. Those of the third category are obviously more theory-dependent notions than those of the other two; and my calling the members of all three categories entities should be taken initially as only a convenient way of speaking and not as an endorsement or denial of any particular theory as to their nature or existence. In the empiricist tradition in the philosophy of mind, secondary mental entities have usually been taken to be the very essence, or at least paradigmatic, of the realm of the mental while states of consciousness have been largely ignored. (Or, perhaps it would be more nearly accurate to say that many have supposed that states of consciousness can be exhaustively analyzed by secondary mental entities.) For this lamentable state of affairs there are very good historical and very poor philosophical reasons; or so at least I have argued in detail elsewhere.' But for good or ill, it is easy to understand how taking mind to consist only, or paradigmatically, of sec-",

Note that in these narratives, the actors or personages are not necessarily human beings; we can have narrative documents concerning, for example, the vicissitudes in the journey of a nuclear submarine (the “actor,” “subject,” or “personage”) or the various avatars in the life of a commercial product. Note also that even if a large amount of narrative documents concerns natural language (NL) texts, this is not necessarily true. A photo representing a situation that verbalized could be expressed as “Three nice girls are lying on the beach” is not of course an NL text, yet it is still a narrative document.

      "title": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self",
      "abstract": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self Roberta Culbertson (bio) Memory and Silence Naive public conceptions of memory, and the attendant assumption that memory takes certain forms and not others, contribute to a curious circumstance surrounding the victimized survivor of violence. The survivor most often, nearly invariably, becomes silent about his victimization, though the experience nevertheless in every case remains somehow fundamental to his existence, and to his unfolding or enfolded conception of himself. This silence is an internal one in which the victim attempts to suppress what is recalled (so as not to relive the victimization countless times), or finds it repressed by some part of himself which functions as a stranger, hiding self from the self’s experience according to unfathomable criteria and requirements. It is external as well: the victim does not tell what she recalls, in part because others do not seem to hear what is said, partly out of a conviction that she will not be believed, and more basically because she simply cannot make the leap to words: “If you were not there, it is difficult to describe or say how it was. It sounds very, very, very. . . . I don’t know if there is [a] word to describe the nightmare one go through . . . how men function under such a stress is one thing, and then how you communicate and express [to] somebody who never knew that such a degree of brutality [is] existing seems like a fantasy.” 1 Yet despite this silence, the momentous nature of threats and harm to the body dictates that violence and trauma nevertheless leave the survivor preoccupied with the memory of it, which itself seems both absent and entirely too present. Most disturbingly, bits of memory, flashing like clipped pieces of film held to the light, appear unbidden and in surprising ways, as if possessed of a life independent of will or consciousness. These undeniable presences nevertheless have an aura of unbelievability: though presenting themselves as clearly past, real, and fully embodied, they appear in nonnarrative forms that seem to meet no standard test for truth or comprehensibility. Survivor writings make it clear that to be a survivor of one’s violation [End Page 169] is precisely this: to live with the paradox of silence and the present but unreachable force of memory, and a concomitant need to tell what seems untellable. 2 The paradox is based in more than simply the difficulty of reporting events that listeners would rather not hear or believe, or which are too different to be grasped. It is the paradox of a known and felt truth that unfortunately obeys the logic of dreams rather than of speech and so seems as unreachable, as other, as these, and as difficult to communicate and interpret, even to oneself. It is a paradox of the distance of one’s own experience. No experience is more one’s own than harm to one’s own skin, but none is more locked within that skin, played out within it in actions other than words, in patterns of consciousness below the everyday and the constructions of language. Trapped there, the violation seems to continue in a reverberating present that belies the supposed linearity of time and the possibility of endings. It at once has a certain pastness, is a sort of “memory-knowledge” as Mary Warnock would call it, and is not past, not “memory”—that is, a personal, narrated account of something completed, locatable in time—at all. Perhaps it is not even remembered, but only felt as a presence, or perhaps it shapes current events according to its template, itself unrecognized. 3 The demands of narrative for their part operate in fact as cultural silencers to this sort of memory, descending immediately upon an experience to shape notions of legitimate memory, and silencing the sort of proto-memory described. We lose sight of the body’s own recall of its response to threat and pain, and of the ways in which it “speaks” this pain, because this wordless language is unintelligible to one whose body is not similarly affected, and because without words the experience has a certain shadowy quality, a paradoxical...",

      "title": "Obligation and Control",
      "abstract": "One cannot perform an act that is morally right, wrong, or obligatory if one does not have appropriate control over that act; deontic acts presuppose control. This is, perhaps, most evident in the case of moral obligation. It is difficult to accept the verdict that Leno, though pinned to his seat, ought to have saved the child, or that the paraplegic ought to have walked across the lawn when 'ought' denotes moral obligation or requirement. Again, it is hard to see how Mitch did something that is morally wrong by failing to help the victim of the car crash when he could not have helped the victim. Or it is, minimally, puzzling to see how Zakir did moral wrong by stealing the loaf when he could not but have stolen it. One might, given apt circumstances, reasonably think that Zakir did something bad by stealing the loaf, but this judgment is consistent with Zakir's not having done wrong. Or, again, it is paradoxical to suppose that the mother's not spanking the child was morally right when she literally lacked the ability to spank her child. These enigmas are not merely pragmatic or do not simply have to do with substantive moral claims about what is fair but are conceptual; the verdict about the paraplegic, for instance, seems conceptually inconsistent. Such examples, and numerous others like them, motivate the view that one cannot do what is right, or wrong, or obligatory unless one has appropriate \"deontic-grounding control\" over what one does.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The metaphysical question asked in this chapter is preliminary to the metaphysical question addressed in the succeeding chapter 11. In the latter chapter the issue is whether every complex action is (identical with) some basic action of willed bodily movement. In this chapter, the preliminary issue is whether every complex action at least ‘involves’ (in some way or other) some willed bodily movement by the actor. Discussed are three classes of cases: first, cases where there are bodily movements causative of some harm, but these movements are not willed; second, cases where there is no apparent bodily movement but there is agency (in mental acts and in intentional omissions) and there is an apparent causal connection (sometimes reconstrued to be only a relation of counterfactual dependence) between that agency and some real world harm; and third, cases where there is neither willing nor bodily movement, as in states of a person and unintentional omissions. The conclusion reached about all such cases is that there is human action only when there is a willed bodily movement.",

Beside changes of external fortune (victory, poverty, freedom, power, etc.), man is subject to changes in his own person, different states of body and mind. The narrow band is more fitted to inescapable outward fortune or to hampering of body or mind, the wide band or cloak, wrapping, to more pervasive states of body or mind. When a man's hands are stricken with weakness, or his limbs are paralysed, they are ‘bound’ by a god; he who is deluded in mind is ‘bound’ with ἄτη or ἐλπίς. On the other hand he puts on, clothes himself or is clothed with, steadfastness, energy, shamelessness, etc. (δύσεο δʾ ἀλκήν, κρατερὸν μένος ἀμϕιβαλόντες, ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένος, etc.). In such cases it is consciousness and thus the organs of consciousness that are primarily affected; and so Homer speaks of Achilles as ϕρεσὶν εἱμένος ἀλκήν as Pindar speaks of ἐλπίδες or ἀμπλακίαι ‘hung about’ the ϕρένες.

The first is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a sensible or natural being; the second is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a rational being endowed with freedom. The man of principles, from whom one knows what to expect, not from his instinct, for example, but from his will, has a character. – Therefore in the Characteristic one can, without tautology, divide what belongs to a human being's faculty of desire (what is practical) into what is characteristic in a) his natural aptitude or natural predisposition, b) his temperament or sensibility, and c) his character purely and simply, or way of thinking. – The first two predispositions indicate what can be made of the human being; the last (moral) predisposition indicates what he is prepared to make of himself.",

How can a political body, which as the calm modifier of individual passions should not itself be swayed by passion, harbour this useless cruelty which is the instrument of rage, of fanaticism or of weak tyrants? Can the waitings of a wretch, perhaps, undo what has been done and turn back the clock? The purpose, therefore, is nothing other than to prevent the offender from doing fresh harm to his fellows and to deter others from doing likewise. Therefore, punishments and the means adopted for inflicting them should, consistent with proportionality, be so selected as to make the most efficacious and lasting impression on the minds of men with the least torment to the body of the condemned.",

Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior plays an important role in survival, reproduction, and building/maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

If this is correct, then claims that people deserve general and specific things are false. At the heart of desert is the notion of moral credit or discredit. People deserve good things (credit) when they are good people or do desirable things. These desirable things might be right, good, or virtuous acts. People deserve bad things (discredit) when they are bad people or do undesirable things. On some theories, people deserve credit in general terms. For instance, they deserve a good life. On other theories, people deserve credit in specific terms. For instance, they deserve specific incomes, jobs, punishments, relationships, or reputations. The author's argument against desert rests on three claims: There is no adequate theory of what desert is. Even if there were an adequate theory of what desert is, nothing grounds (justifies) desert. Even if there were an adequate theory of what desert is and something were to ground it, there is no plausible account of what people deserve.

In the context of animal welfare, cascades have often occurred, and more consequential ones are possible. First: In this domain, preference falsification has run and is running rampant. Those who care about animal welfare, or are inclined to want to say or do something about it, often silence themselves. They know that if they speak or act, they might incur social disapproval or worse. Second: People have different thresholds for disclosing their views or for taking action. With respect to animal welfare, some people really will speak out or act, even if no one else does. Others need someone to follow – but only one. Still others need two, or three, or a hundred, or more. Third: Social interactions are and continue to be crucial to the movement for animal welfare. Who is seeing whom? When? Who is talking to whom? Are visible people speaking and acting in ways that support animal welfare? Are they credible? With whom? Fourth: In many times and places, believers in animal rights, animal welfare, or both have created communities of like-minded people. These communities can be highly effective. They create a commitment to a belief that might have been held tentatively. They make that belief salient, potentially part of people’s identity. They increase confidence and unity.",

      "title": "A Plea for Pity",
      "abstract": "A Plea for Pity Robert H. Kimball Introduction Does the ability to feel pity toward the unfortunate represent one of humanity's better instincts, on par with the capacity for love, compassion, and forgiveness? Or is pity actually one of our morally baser emotions, like jealousy, envy, or hatred, because pity can include contempt for its object and an attitude of morally reprehensible superiority on the part of the pitier? Surprisingly, there is little philosophical consensus on this issue, with informed opinion nearly equally divided. That the same emotion can elicit such contrary evaluations shows how elusive a clear understanding of pity can be. Furthermore, is there something wrong—either logically or morally—with attempting to arouse the emotion of pity in others when they do not already feel it themselves (or do not feel it as intensely as we want them to)? Should appeals to pity be rejected because any emotion is inimical to clear thinking or simply irrelevant to the justification of action? Or is there something particularly morally reprehensible about trying to manipulate another's emotions and actions specifically on the basis of pity? Alternatively, at least in some cases could an exhortation to pity be an acceptable, even desirable, aspect of moral education or an often-necessary reminder to care about the misfortunes of others and not just to pursue our own self-interests? Surprisingly, opinion (at least in the informal fallacy tradition) is remarkably unanimous about the undesirability of appealing to pity. But I think their reasons can be improved upon. Traditional analyses of appeal to pity do not seriously analyze the emotion being appealed to, and most treatments of pity as an emotion do not address its use in rhetorical manipulation. I claim that what is wrong with appeal to pity can be satisfactorily understood only if pity itself is adequately understood. I propose to proceed by combining these two questions: what is wrong with pity? and what is wrong with appeal to pity? [End Page 301] In answering the second question, the textbook tradition of informal fallacy analysis holds that when a speaker attempts to arouse pity in an audience in order to induce an action, this situation should be interpreted not under the rubric of nonlogical causal influence, manipulation, or rhetorical persuasion but rather as belonging to the domain of (informal) logic, and in particular as a failed attempt at argument in which a descriptive premise that A pities B does not entail the normative conclusion that B deserves A's help (or that A should help B). Thus in the informal fallacy tradition, experiencing the emotion of pity is never a valid justification for action.2 I believe this rigid reason/emotion distinction has little basis in our actual belief-forming and decision-making practices. Nor do I believe that emotion should be excluded from reasoning, since our emotions are often informative and are sometimes more reliable guides to action than argument. In Appeal to Pity, Douglas Walton (1997) presents a nuanced and considerably more subtle alternative to the textbook tradition, in which he evaluates epistemically the effect of the emotional state of pity on practical reasoning. Analyzing such cases as charitable appeals (e.g., for starving people and disaster victims, arguments for hardship exemptions from general rules, and alleged atrocities), he emphasizes especially the particularizing nature of pity and the way it overrides universal principles, especially of justice. Under Walton's epistemic evaluation of pity, it emerges as a reason-clouding emotion under certain conditions. Furthermore, he shows how the occurrence of pity is susceptible to manipulation; he emphasizes especially cases in which pity is not actually deserved or justified but is manipulatively made to seem so. But Walton looks at a very small slice of the landscape of pity and what might be problematic about it. So in order to evaluate pity fully—not just epistemically but also as a moral emotion and its role in a fully flourishing life—we need to expand our concept of pity. In fact, pity is a very difficult and complex emotion to analyze (Solomon 1993). Definition of \"pity\" In pitying someone, such as a homeless person, a starving child, or a mutilated...",

Hence we should consider all events, even the smallest, as manifestations of God’s will and pleasure. Seeking God means willing nothing and desiring nothing except what he wills and arranges by his providence. We should consider as it were two acts in God in our regard: one by which he wills to give us certain graces to lead us to a certain degree of glory if we are faithful to him, and the other by which he does not will to give us more grace or raise us to a higher degree of glory than this. Few people have enough courage and fidelity to fulfil God’s purpose, and reach by their co-operation that degree of grace and glory which God desires.",

      "abstract": "In spite of the confusing variety of the material, the murderers can be divided into three groups. The one is the young slayer, the hold-up man, the killer after an insignificant quarrel, who consciously has very little relation to death. He does not think about his own death, and the life of the other has no particular significance for him. His heterosexual attachments are incomplete. In the second group, the motives of the deed seem to be understandable. On closer examination, however, there are found deep-lying disturbances in the emotional life. In the third group, the preoccupation with the problem of death and murder plays a very great part. To them murder or death is a punishment. In all instances, by conscious and unconscious reasons, the murderer does not respect the integrity of the body of his victim, and seemingly lacks a deeper emotional insight into the meaning of life and death.

Definition 2 restricts ‘habit’ to a type of *learned behaviour; it is a special case of definition 1, but is stated separately because this is what ‘habit’ commonly means in the contemporary learning literature. In the early learning literature, ‘habit’ was also occasionally used to denote a learned act in general, but this is now unacceptable. Habits comprise a substantial chunk of our behavioural repertoire, often to a larger degree than we tend to concede.

      "abstract": "Wood has been used in all the societies since the beginning of the world in the same or similar manners thanks to the benefits it has provided to humans in terms of elimination of the various requirements relating to everyday life as a paraphernalia or application or as a tool. In this scope, wood, a natural fibrous and porous natural material obtained from trees, has served for the entire humanity by means of being used directly or indirectly as included into construction partially or completely, in terms of fulfillment of the requirements and needs. In this sense, existence of wood in the daily life directly or indirectly will continue in the future as in the past. The fact that wood has a significant role in our lives as a tool or paraphernalia or a manner of application and that it has been a significant intercultural instrument of communication that ensures the transmission of culture among the generations and cultures demonstrate the indispensability of wood; in other words, its characteristic of being a very valuable material that is used passionately. In summary, wood, a natural and organic material, is a very important existence in our lives and a very valuable material for us thanks to its benefits it provides to us. The reason for wood for being such a valuable material for us is its unique properties with its anatomic structure and chemical compounds as well as its physical and mechanical properties. In this essay, the phenomenon of acknowledging wood that is an intercultural tool of interaction as a \"valuable object\" was depicted through unique compositions created in a different manner and structure as much as possible with 3 original descriptions that were prepared in line with the subjective mentality based on the idea that \"Wood is Valuable.\"",

      "abstract": "Humans are characterized by a compulsive tendency to distinguish themselves from the rest: differences in clothes, hairstyle or \"decorative\" details are used to this effect, based on highly diverse criteria. Such differentiating practices may be aimed at identification with a certain ideological group, for example, or with a concrete \"fashion\", and involve the use of jewelry, clothes, unusual attire, hairstyles, mutilations, etc. In this context, the present review addresses certain aspects of mutilation practices from both the general and specifically dental perspectives. Mutations imply permanent or lasting sectioning or lesions of a part of the body, and comprise skeletal deforming, dental mutilations, circumcision, ablation of the clitoris, scarification, tattoos, and perforations (particularly of the soft tissues). In this sense, tattoos and perforations or piercings are popular -- particularly among adolescents. This trend may be interpreted as a form of communication, identity expression, or as a type of body cult (i.e., so-called \"body art\"). Such mutilating practices reflect different motivations including fashion, rebelliousness, differentiation, sexual motives, the remembering of events, physical sensations, and ethnic or tribal influences. However, these practices can cause complications such as infections, laceration and soft and hard tissue damage, hypersensitivity reactions and other alterations of variable severity. Under these premises, questions are raised concerning the competence of those who perform these mutilations, the preventive measures adopted, and the legal conditions under which tattoos and piercings are made in our society.",

But if, in the life to come, it is not possible for a person to be united with God, can God have a morally sufficient reason for allowing their suffering? After rejecting Stump's ingenious answer to this question, I argue that God has a morally sufficient reason to allow an inhabitant of even a maximally bad hell to suffer, namely, to prevent their further separation from God, and from themselves, and to motivate their ‘affective’ union with God.",

He (or she) loses freedom of choice. Because of a deep emotional and physical need of addicts to get a drug, their basic activity is inclined to supply &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance. Repeating use of substance and its effects, affect their health and interpersonal&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;relationships. Addict denies that. His (or her) possibility to recognize it is limited or ruined. Incorrect pattern of life persists.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Cognition of real facts about substance evidently does not protect enough from addiction. In this work effectiveness of a&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;specific, emotional approach in the therapy of addiction has been analyzed. Dependent is faced with another emotion,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;supposing competitive to those of consuming &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance it is. It is expected that strong emotion could activate&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;available, but unattended cognitive contents. Experimental confirmation of working hypothesis is based on emotional&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;approach to alcohol-dependents. They have been faced with an emotional (literal and /or painted) message of anonym child in the connection with children&amp;#039;s heavy firsthand experiences of alcoholism in the family. Facing consequences, marks and products of dependence (firsthand experienced children&amp;#039;s desperation), experiencing strong enough emotional answer, empathy with other child, alcoholic recognizes desperation of his own related. Faced those experiences, he recognizes their own parental role in their family as negative role. Skilled psychiatrist can use that empathy as significant therapeutic factor. This empathy makes dependent able to overcome fear of changes and face the necessity to change their pattern of life. Most of them, without any further explanations have been turned into insight of addiction and oriented toward the therapy and rehabilitation. Results encourage practicing physician to apply this approach, first of all in the initiation of the therapy (realizing contacts, insight into disease) and later in the psychotherapy of any kind of chemical dependence. The key task of the therapist could be to find out specific, strong enough emotion that could be in certain case competitive to those of pleasure connected to the misuse of substance and a strong challenge to initiate cognitive processes and to change executive behaviour.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

During moral panics, audiences are sensitized to any and all harms that stipulated deviants or folk devils might cause, and seize upon even flimsy evidence to support the claims. Fear or concern need not grip the entire society to qualify as a moral panic. Micro-and meso-panics – those that overtake and are acted upon by specific communities or by particular social sectors – also qualify as panics. Moral panics tend to be transitory. A particular threat erupts, grows in intensity and magnitude, then declines in strength, and may even evaporate altogether.

      "title": "‘Pleasures’,'Pains’ and Animal Welfare: Toward a Natural History of Affect",
      "abstract": "Abstract In hedonic theories of motivation, ‘motivational affective states’ (MASs) are typically seen as adaptations which motivate certain types of behaviour, especially in situations where a flexible or learned response is more adaptive than a rigid or reflexive one. MASs can be negative (eg unpleasant feelings of hunger or pain) or positive (eg pleasant feelings associated with eating and playing). Hedonic theories often portray negative and positive MASs as opposite ends of a one-dimensional scale. We suggest that natural selection has favoured negative and positive affect as separate processes to solve two different types of motivational problems. We propose that negative MASs (eg thirst, fear) evolved in response to ‘need situations’ where the fitness benefit of an action has increased, often because the action is needed to cope with a threat to survival or reproductive success. We propose that these negative MASs develop in response to a change in the body (eg dehydration) or the environment (eg the approach of a predator) which creates the need for action, and that negative MASs can become intense and prolonged if the threat to fitness is high and persistent. We propose that positive MASs evolved in ‘opportunity situations ‘ where an action (eg playing, exploring) has become advantageous because the fitness cost of performing it has declined. We propose that these positive MASs occur during, or as a result of, the performance of types of behaviour which are beneficial for fitness at a variety of times, not only when they are required to meet immediate needs; and that the pleasure inherent in the behaviour motivates the animal to perform it when the cost of so doing is sufficiently low. Some behaviour (eg eating) can be motivated by both positive and negative affect. Other behaviour, such as playing or fleeing from a predator, may be motivated largely by positive or negative affect alone. Our hypothesis needs to be tested, but we suggest that it corresponds well to common human experience. The hypothesis provides a basis for predicting whether an aspect of animal management is likely to cause strong and prolonged negative affect (‘suffering’), or to prevent animals from experiencing certain types of pleasure. This distinction is important for bringing animal welfare assessment into line with ethical concerns.",

      "abstract": "The problem of environment is important for older people, because there are so many of them with little or nothing to do. There are two fundamental approaches to the problem of human beings and environment: the first asks what the human being does to his environment, seeking to learn how the person projects himself on the external world; the second asks what the environment does to the human being, seeking to know how the environment modifies the person. In thinking about environments for older people, attention is too often given the physical aspects, to the exclusion of the psychological aspects. Objects and people may be in the physical environment of a person of any age without affecting him. Constraints are the limitations which surround a person and prevent him from realizing his potentialities. They include not only prohibitions that are explicitly verbalized, but also all interferences, deficiencies, and inadequacies that prevent the use of personal, material, and group resources.",

      "title": "Assault Sorcery and Religion",
      "abstract": "Assault sorcery is a type of aggressive magical action against victims, distinguished from other types of sorcery by its imputed use of physical aggression and associated with intergroup hostility and ritual practices involving cosmological ideas of magical power and performance. Secrecy is the hallmark of the sorcerer’s activity and the means by which the sorcerer attacks a victim. In <italic>leavings sorcery</italic>, the sorcerer observes victims’ moves and stealthily harvests food leavings, or bits of them, on which spells can be made to kill the victim. Leavings sorcery is a variety of a wider class of magical actions that are based on the idea that people’s vital force exists in anything that has been in close contact with them. The actions must be done in secret, and the sorcerers must take care not to handle the bespelled items themselves so as to avoid being harmed by their own magical actions. In both assault sorcery and leavings sorcery, internal body parts of the victim are targeted. In leavings sorcery, the bespelled item enters the victim’s body, disrupting its normal processes. In assault sorcery, the sorcerer is said to open up the body of the victim directly and replace its vital organs with pieces of rubbish. The body and its internal functioning parts are the locus of action in both cases. These practices may involve the secret invocation of spirits and the performance of actions that imply supernatural powers generated by the sorcerer’s manipulative actions, such as by confronting the victim and reducing the victim to terrified submission in the face of the confrontation by the sorcerer. Reports make it clear that the sorcerer intimidates the victim away from sight of the community and is accompanied by a set of accomplices. The sorcerer’s power is thus to be seen as based in magic rather than as founded simply on physical strength. The same can be said of other categories of sorcery, such as sorcery based on the contamination of food leavings and the magical treatment of such leavings so as to kill a victim. Sorcery beliefs all ultimately depend on the creation of fear; in extreme cases, fear itself can cause a victim’s death. This psychosocial syndrome opens up the possibility of comparing classic assault sorcery with methods of intimidation that appear in the running of academic institutions in which those in power confront enemies with accusations and character assassination that can lead to expulsion or to harassment, which taxes the endurance of the victims and dangerously weakens them. The psychosocial context is also important in all circumstances in which sorcery is feared and its practice is kept secret. The basic cosmology is found in many regions of the world.",

It is normally good for B to forgive A after A has made at least some attempt at making atonement, but B has no obligation to forgive. To wrong someone is analogous to occurring an (unauthorized) debt to the person, and forgiving is deeming the debt to have been paid. Christ taught that, in order to forgive humans, God requires them to apologize with repentance. But God requires no reparation or penance (apart from that provided for us by Christ’s life and death) and imposes a condition on forgiving us—that we should forgive other humans who seek our forgiveness.",

      "title": "Altruism and Biology",
      "abstract": "Abstract In the vernacular, “altruism” is a psychological term; its application depends on the motives with which an action is performed. A's action is altruistic if and only if A's ultimate motive in performing the action is the furtherance of some other individual's (or individuals') welfare. A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, the other individual receives no benefit (because of some unforeseen interference, say). And A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, A (and A alone) benefits from the action, so long as that outcome was not A's ultimate motive. If A acts to benefit B but A's ultimate motive for doing so is that furthering B's welfare promises in turn to benefit A (via boosting A's reputation, say), then A's action is not altruistic but selfish. On the face of it, there is no reason to assume that this distinction is exhaustive. It seems possible that actions can be done for motives that have nothing to do with benefiting anyone, or can be done for mixed motives where benefits to both actor and other are important motivating factors but neither is ultimate.",

Celtic supernatural beings described in folktale (Scottish elves, witches or ‘selkies.’ Irish síth, Breton korrigan, Cornish Spriggans and so on) may use song (and less often, dance) in various tactical ways and modes: to decorate their own ‘parallel’ (but Other) cultural realm, to celebrate and show the superior Otherness of this realm, to lure humans into their power (often breaking the boundaries of ‘human’ time and space in the process) or for other reasons. Eastern and South Slavic supernatural beings (Russian rusalka, Serbian vile and others) show some similar characteristics, though the vila herself has variant forms (which can be related to the Dumézilian fonctions) – and some shamanistic modes seem possible here. In the end, in both contexts supernatural beings are described as separated from humankind – but then ‘song and dance’ brings them back into the human realm again. Their acts and intentions may be benignant or malignant, but what is shown is the imagined power of the Other, and we can indeed find valuable comparanda in the two Indo-European (Celtic and Slavic) cultural-linguistic areas.",

Social action, which includes both failure to act and passive acquiescence, may be oriented to the past, present, or expected future behavior of others. Thus it may be motivated by revenge for a past attack, defense against present, or measures of defense against future aggression. Social action is not identical either with the similar actions of many persons or with every action influenced by other persons. Thus, if at the beginning of a shower a number of people on the street put up their umbrellas at the same time, this would not ordinarily be a case of action mutually oriented to that of each other. Purely affectual behavior also stands on the borderline of what can be considered \"meaningfully\" oriented, and often it, too, goes over the line.",

      "abstract": "The disposition of Article 299 Part 1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine provides criminal liability for animal’s cruel treatment, including for inflicting bodily harm in the injury form. However, regulations and sources of scientific literature don’t contain a definition of the animal mutilation concept and the procedure for its establishment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the practice of forensic veterinary examination of animal’s bodily injuries, which resulted in injury. The article shows that the author's definition of \"animal mutilation\" is a persistent disorder of animal health due to injury or its consequences, congenital malformations, diseases, accidents that led to complete or partial loss of any organ or animal body part, or to the total or partial loss of only the functions of the organ or parts of the animal's body, which in the interaction of the animal with the environment may lead to permanent loss or significant limitation of the ability to provide physiological manifestations at the level of other animals of the same species(nutrition, reproduction, orientation and movement in space, coordination of movements, natural lifestyles, contact with other animals, self-defense, ability to perform useful work, etc.), and distorts the appearance of the animal due to mutilation of body parts due to deformation, and their physical absence. The purpose of a live subject with signs of injury forensic veterinary examination is to determine the location, nature, severity of damage to animal health, nature of the injury, the degree of disability of the animal in connection with the injury, as well as solving other tasks within the competence of forensic veterinary expert, as well as at the request of the body or person who appointed the expertise or involved the expert. It was stated that the forensic veterinary examination objects are live experimental animals in order to establish their mutilation, including victims of abuse or other illegal actions, as well as signs of congenital malformations, pathological conditions that developed during breeding, animal’s exploitation and transportation; accidents. It was found out that the subjects of forensic veterinary examination of the subject for the purpose of establishing its mutilation are veterinarians who have higher veterinary education, have been trained in forensic veterinary examination in the expert specialty 18.1 \"Veterinary Research\" and have the forensic veterinary expert qualification. When deciding on the infliction of an animal bodily injuries that caused its injury, the forensic veterinary expert must use the \"Rules of forensic veterinary determination of the severity of damage to animal health\" and the \"Methodology of forensic veterinary examination of animals to determine their injury\". Key words: animals, mutilation, injuries, ill-treatment, forensic veterinary examination.",

Loki (apocryphal) I.In one retelling of creation, God creates humans not once, but twice.In the first story of creation, these humans (both male and female) are said to be conjured in God's image.They are told to fill the earth and subdue it.In contrast, having finished His work, God rests.In the second story of creation, God forms man from dust and breathes life into what He fashions.Later, God subdivides His creation to save the man from being alone.The two humans are thus both a part of each other, but separate from one another: 'bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh'.They are an excess or luxury in an otherwise economic and purposeful system.Everything is in its place and nothing could be elsewhere.There is divine order.Childlike and innocent, these second humans are left to be together and to play in the Garden.We all know they were heading for a fall -there is trickery in the Garden . . . II.In one of the stories about the beginning, the fruit of two trees are forbidden to the humans: 'the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil'.The serpent 'more crafty than any beast of the field' isn't lying when it speaks about the nature of the fruit of the first tree.Having eaten from it, the humans are banished lest they eat from the second tree that would give them immortality.God can bear no equals -and He sets a hierarchy between himself and humans, and between the man and woman.After the Garden, humans are thrown back on to each other.Friendship with God does not seem possible.God is unitary and complete; the humans are multiple and forever unfinished.No longer childlike and innocent, they are to toil and suffer.They are left to contemplate each other and their own lack of purpose and necessity (it is their pathway to friendship and play). III.Abraham is an exceptional human being as he is said to be the friend of God.Outside of monotheism, humans find themselves as both the playthings and the playmates of the gods.Friendship is found in invention, transgression, trickery, and treachery.It is found in the interplay of humans and gods, and every creature and being both mythical and mundane.Such a world is open and dynamic.It is a woven patchwork of disparate pieces and contradictions (ontologically, spatially, temporally).In such a world that is both unfinished and unfinishable, friendship and play, in all their myriad varieties, can flourish.IV. Exposing humans as the murderers of God, Nietzsche's Madman exhorts us to contemplate the sacred games we shall have to invent to be worthy of the deed.He asks whether we shall have to become gods even to seem worthy of the deed.The crime precipitates nihilism: this condition is kaleidoscopic.Once again humans are free to play; humans are free to forge new forms of",

In the Goffman sense, IP is that which we \"give\" throught intentional creative action (e.g. the fruit of our labour), while HP is that which we \"give off\" (our \"heart and soul\") simply by being human. Analogous to the visceral, and obviously exaggerated metaphor of the Pirate (one who takes that which is meant to be given but merely denies profit), I put forth a metaphor for what I argue to be those committing a far greater transgression: Pigs, being those who steal HP. Furthermore, I include a third class, which I call Rapists, as being those who inseminate us with unwated informatic material.

      "title": "Ahiysa and compassion in Jainism",
      "abstract": "Ahiysa is one of the core ethical values in Jainism, as expressed in the oft-quoted\nphrase “ahiysa paramo dharmah (nonviolence is the supreme form of religious\nconduct).” Padmanabh S. Jaini has observed that within Jainism there is a\n“preoccupation with ahiysa,” for no other religious tradition “has carried it\n[ahiysa] to the extreme of the Jainas. For them it is not simply the first among\nvirtues but the virtue.”1 Although in most religious traditions non-harming relates\nto other living beings, Jaini has noted that “for Jainas, however, it [hiysa] refers\nprimarily to injuring oneself – to behavior which inhibits the soul’s ability to\nattain moksa.”2 The reasoning here is that a tendency to intentionally harm other\nliving beings that is motivated by strong passions (kasaya) causes the binding of\nharmful varieties (papa prakrti) of karmic matter to one’s own soul. These\nkarmas cause rebirth in undesirable states of existence as hell-beings (naraki) and\nanimals (tiryanca) that are characterized by a preponderance of suffering and that\nare not conducive to spiritual progress, thereby prolonging the soul’s journey in\nsaAsara.3",

      "abstract": "Common sense does not doubt that nonhuman animals (especially mammals and avian species) are centres of experience, subjects of a life that can be better or worse for them. They can flourish or languish. Like human individuals, they can be benefited as well as harmed. They are harmed by being caused stress, distress, pain, or suffering and, ultimately, by being killed. Most of us would admit that the treatment they are subjected to in research laboratories, intensive farming operations, circuses, on fur farms, during hunts, etc, raises moral questions, in the sense of requiring moral (as opposed to, say, economic) justification. Unless we think of animals as 'machines' and/or profit from their treatment as mere means to our ends, we are inclined to feel that there are certain things it is 'not right' to do with respect to other animals. The question is: what should be done about it? How can profound structural change and improvements be brought about in the basic fabric of contemporary society with regard to the treatment of animals, and how are specific changes to be accomplished at a more basic level?",

      "abstract": "Everyone has five senses: touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. Each of these plays a vital role in one's life. But what happens when you don't have one of these and are forced to live with it? Hearing loss is a condition that affects one of these five senses: hearing. Those affected by this condition lose their hearing. It may be a partial loss or complete loss but they cannot hear as one normally should. This condition is quickly growing to be common around the globe affecting a wide variety of people. What makes these conditions so unique is that there is a multitude of causes for them. This paper focuses on some of these causes to find a connection. It was found that one connection between all of these causes is that they are a result of some sort of physical damage or injury to the ear. But this injury’s location and specifications are different in each case yet the result is also hearing loss. Furthermore, this paper offers solutions and prevention for some of the different cases of hearing loss that can be encountered; thereby preparing persons to avoid this condition.",

      "title": "Hybrid Incentives: Carrots, Sticks, or Carrots Which Become Sticks?",
      "abstract": "Various incentives may be used in order to cause a person to desist from an activity that creates negative externalities. It is possible, naturally, to use a stick and to apply an economic sanction in order to incentivize them to desist from that activity. It is also possible to use a carrot, i.e., to grant them a financial prize if they desist from the activity. Each of these incentives has advantages and disadvantages. Literature and practice are familiar with various combinations of sticks and carrots. In most cases, the mechanism is “horizontal”, e.g. using carrots with respect to certain parts of the population, and sticks against other parts. The Article presents a novel, vertical, sequential mechanism, in the form of a “game” played in two consecutive stages that are connected to each other, that trap the person who perpetrated a negative action within the mechanism, with no possible way out. At the center of the first stage of the vertical mechanism stands a carrot – a reward or a positive incentive – which is combined with a certain social sanction (shaming). At the center of the second stage, which is activated only if the implementation of the first stage did not meet with success, stands a stick – a punishment or a negative incentive. The objective will be to incentivize a person to engage in fruitful negotiations to end the harmful activity at the pre-mechanism stage, for after the mechanism begins operating and as more time passes, he will only lose. For this purpose, an illustration will be offered of the negative social behavior of one-sided refusal to give or accept the Jewish divorce bill in the Jewish sector the world over, in a reality in which it is not possible under religious law to compel a refuser to give or accept that bill, namely, the intractable agunah problem. The mechanism will be built primarily on the basis of a few theories from the field of law and economics: reversible rewards, dual-chooser rules, and modular liability rules. The main argument will be that the use of a multi-part vertical incentives mechanism increases efficiency at minimal additional cost; it overcomes a moral problem of “rewarding the sinner” by giving him a carrot and combines in optimal fashion the advantages entailed by activating the sticks and the carrots, and at the same time – insofar as possible – nullifies most of the disadvantages of each of them.",

      "title": "Footholds and Strongholds",
      "abstract": "At creation God made humans in His image and likeness, endowing them with powers and abilities akin to their Creator. One distinguishing quality which humans alone possessed, unique from all other creatures, was the power of choice—the will. This unique attribute made humans the only creatures with the ability to say yes or no to God. Since the devil’s fall from glory, it has been his mission to deceive and enlist others in his rebellion against the sovereignty of God. Continuing the work of deception and rebellion he began in heaven before he and his confederates were forcefully expelled, he seeks in his wrath against the Creator to totally deface the image of God from the lives of His children (Rev 12:17). To achieve these objectives Satan seeks inroads into people’s lives; means by which he can obtain a foothold, which could later become a stronghold, to gain total control or subordination of the human will to his whims and pleasures. Ultimately, as Jesus stated, his mission is to “kill, and steal, and destroy” (John 10:10). The beginning point for his objective is finding a foothold to obtain access into the lives of God’s creatures, for whom He sent His Son to die on the cross. As a result of the great conflict which broke out in heaven (Rev 12:7-11), the devil and his evil angels were expelled from their former abode and became vagrants in need of new habitations. This problem was solved when the devil tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden to disobey God. By complying to the counsel of the deceiver, the earth’s dominion was ceded to the usurper (Gen 3). The fall of Adam and Eve occurred because the devil found a foothold, an entry point into the heart of Eve. This foothold was the sin of covetousness. Eve apparently coveted the adulation and glory only God should have; she desired to be worshiped (v. 5). Eve was deceived by Satan who thereby gained control of her and subsequently used her as an agent to tempt Adam to join in the rebellion against God. Adam, on his part, apparently chose to join his wife in her disobedience rather than to obey God and live. In attempting to be godlike Adam and Eve lost their paradise home, their dominion over the entire creation, and their position as custodians of God’s world entrusted to them. Intriguingly, the same unholy ambition which Satan had nursed—the desire to have the position, dominion, and glory belonging to the Creator—he transmitted to Adam and Eve.",

(1) It is surreptitious, not candid, and goes on unrecognized, with our implicit or explicit approval. (2) It progressively reduces and spoils our natural intimacy, spontaneity, and sensory awareness. (3) Fear, anger, distress, and maneuvers aimed at avoidance are typical responses to its threatened unmasking. (4) From its earlier history as a \"good\" and necessary game, it is fast becoming (simply because it is a game and dishonest, and therefore in the end self-defeating) a \"bad\" and indeed suicidal one, crying out for our immediate recognition and counter-measures. The urgency is underscored by the many-sided threat it now poses to its players, to people everywhere, to the very survival of humanity and many other species. (5) The fact that, since each of us learned it, the game can be unlearned, and the fact that it is superfluous and can with immense and all-round benefit be opted out of, are demonstrated by the lives and teachings over the past 3,000 years of notable non-players – \"seers\" belonging to all religions and none whose numbers seem to be increasing.",

In malignant trauma, cure is not attainable because the core of traumatic experience remains in part untouched by symbolic expressions, leaving a person with a sense of inarticulateness and isolation. Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of loss: (a) shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a cry; (d) loss of trust associated with the experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of an other's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs. These losses defy symbolization because symbolization is contingent upon constitutional biological structures and experiences of an obliged, trustworthy, and faithful other.",

      "abstract": "Abstract If we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by some ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive – the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, hut until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

Wandering is a single-minded determination to walk that is unresponsive to persuasion. The behavioural definition distinguishes between wandering with risk and wandering as nuisance, as well as interpreting walking as wandering if the behaviour is to excess, even though there is no risk or disturbance to others. Separation anxiety motivates those with dementia to cling to this other person, or if the person with dementia is removed to another setting in order to give their family respite from the suffocating pressure of being trailed, they will attempt to leave so they may seek the whereabouts of those significant others.

      "abstract": "Abstract Human and nonhuman animals share an adaptive capacity to plan for the future by acquiring and saving important items, such as food to survive long, cold winters. In addition, humans amass material goods well beyond what they appear to need—a tendency that we refer to as “acquisitiveness.” The current chapter frames our view of acquisitiveness as a typical, human phenomenon that exists across individuals to varying degrees, from a “Spartan” desire to avoid excess possessions or clutter, through normal levels of acquisition, up through the excessive acquisition and retention observed in hoarding disorder. Acquisitiveness is adaptive at most levels but shares features in common with the excessive hoarding of clinical populations including hoarding disorder, OCD, frontal lobe syndrome, and eating disorders. Acquisitiveness appears to derive from multiple underlying instincts, including the tendency to hold on to goods that are needed in the future, the desire to display one’s quality to mates and social partners, and the “nesting instinct” to surround oneself with materials that afford a feeling of security. We summarize this framework and our own work on the phenomenon. Acquisitiveness is an important and ubiquitous human behavior that reflects adaptive instincts, which can nevertheless negatively impact personal finances, emotional well-being, and the environment in ways that we need to understand.",

Gambling is the betting of money or something of material value on an event with an unsure result with the main target of winning additional money or material goods. Normally, the result of the bet is clearly to be seen within a short period. It has often been seen as having social consequences. For these social and religious reasons, most legal jurisdictions limit Gambling. But it increases in our present society day by day. The Vedic seers also feel the harmfulness of the Gambling and stated it in the thirty fourth hymn of the tenth ma ][ ala of the Rgveda. This hymn (X.34) brings out the picture of a person who because of his addiction of dice play is completely ruined but can’t resist the temptation even when he is lent in a measurable condition. It is also elaborated (itih sapur ] bhy veda I samupab aI hayet) in the great epic Mah bh rata ( Dyutaparva, 65th chapter, sub parva of Sabh parva ) through the dice game between Duryodhana’s uncle Sakuni (Kauravas) and Yudhi ^@ hira (Pandavas).

All of us, for example, have an innate capacity to experience anger, resentment, joy, happiness, sadness, hunger, thirst, and sexual attraction, among many other things. The peculiarities of one's environment determine and limit the range of which particular things will be the objects of one's desires and aversions, as well as under which particular circumstances one will feel or act on various motivations. But the desires, aversions, and motivations themselves are given by our nature. The characteristic of human nature that Smith thinks principally bears on moral standards and moral judgments is, as we have seen, the desire for mutual sympathy, though other characteristics—like one's natural partiality for oneself and the natural interest one has in the fortunes of others—play important roles as well.",

Los estudios detallados y especializados sobre este tema son cada vez mas frecuentes y los cientificos de todas las areas afectadas comienzan a trabajar de forma interdisciplinaria en este campo. La tesis titulada terremotos medievales. Presupuestos mentales y realidad social para el estudio de la sismicidad historica comparada, pertenece a los estudios que mencionamos. En este trabajo se aborda el pensamiento medieval sobre el fenomeno del terremoto.

      "title": "The Universal Character of Crime: The Mother of All Wounds That Never Healed",
      "abstract": "This article aims to contribute thoughts in response to a series of questions around general issues related to (1) crimes that involve individual humans as perpetrators, and (2) traits inherent in the structure of every crime. The method that guides this work in formulating a comprehensive vision of truth is “conceptual analysis”. The author, therefore, will strip and decipher the standard concepts of crime down to their most elementary units. All data that is qualified to be processed analytically-conceptually is bibliographical (electronic and manual) data. The data collection stage is guided by keywords. Results: (1) Crime is an intersubjective activity. Every behavior can be qualified as evil/criminal as long as the element of dolus malus has been fulfilled, or at least, it expresses a shape of indifference from the perpetrator that can harm the soul, body, and property of others (culpa). There is no other definition beyond this which will be more significant in showing its normative-juridical and socio-juridical character. (2) everyone can become evil as long as there are: (a) potential victims; (b) mens rea, and (c) opportunity. The reason: we are creatures endowed by God with the skills to (a) defend ourselves and (b) project a better life in the future. Whoever the person is, one day may become an easy target in the act of violence because basically, people outside of us are selfish beings who carry natural talent as criminal beings wherever they go, homo homini lupus; (3) every crime has three general characteristics: (a) destructive; (b) antisocial; and (c) producing wounds that are often incurable.",

      "abstract": "George Ivanovich Gurdjieff (c. 1866–1949) taught that humans are sleeping machines who do not possess souls. Enlightened people are awake and survive death as they worked to grow a soul (or kesdjan body). Gurdjieff's teaching is called the 'Work' or the 'Fourth Way'. To promote soul growth Gurdjieff gave pupils exercises, including: practices related to diet, eating, and drinking; actions to facilitate integrated modes of being (the Movements or 'sacred dances'); and 'spiritual' work (including fasting and contemplative exercises). This chapter examines four aspects of health and healing in the Work: (1) Gurdjieff's powers, by which he allegedly drew diseases from the bodies of those who came for cures into his body and battled and defeated them; (2) the Movements, which integrated the 'three centres', emotional, intellectual, and physical; (3) daily practices like physical labour, diet, and alcoholic drinks; and (4) the exercises and piqures (injections, likely drugs and hormones) he gave to the literary lesbian women's group he taught in the 1930s, 'the Rope'. While Gurdjieff is not a teacher of wellness or therapeutic regimes, he has an idea of human optimisation through soul-building.",

      "title": "Nature and Object of Faith",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term “faith” is frequently used in a generic sense without any religious or theological significance. Philosophers and others use it to mean the acceptance as true or real of anything that is not immediately evident or demonstrable. In this sense faith is an ingredient in virtually all human knowledge and activity. Whenever I read the newspapers, speak about history or science, and in fact whenever I get on a train, eat a meal, or perform many other ordinary actions, I am implicitly making acts of human or natural—that is to say, non-theological—faith. In so doing I may be following a spontaneous instinct, an acquired habit, or a free, voluntary decision. I may be said to be exercising faith in my senses, in my memory, in the reliability of a machine, or in the competence and integrity of other persons. The term “faith” is especially appropriate in the case of firm beliefs involving implicit trust in another person or other persons. Faith in this case is closely connected with love and loyalty. The English word “believe” is etymologically connected with the word “love,” just as the Latin credereimplies a gift of the heart (cordare). Faith normally leads to faithful action, which is a matter of”keeping faith” with persons or living up to one’s commitments. When a person is said to have or profess a faith, the reference may be to a com­prehensive vision that serves to give an interpretation of life as whole, including a scale of values. For convinced adherents, philosophical systems such as Platonism and ideologies such as Marxist Communism serve as faiths of a quasi-religious type. Faith in the theological sense includes everything connected with the secular meaning of the term. But over and above this, it is a response to God as he acts and manifests himself in the world and in human consciousness.",

When such force is exercised by the victim, it is self-defense; when by a third party, other-defense. Self-defense and other-defense are preemptive uses of force because they occur before the acts they are intended to prevent occur. Thus, they operate in the realm of epistemic uncertainty. Victims and third parties can never be certain the feared acts will occur. They can never be certain of what their consequences will be if the acts occur. They can never be certain what alternative exists to self-defense and other-defense for averting the feared harms. And they can never be certain what the status of the presumed attacker is—that is, whether the presumed attacker is culpable or nonculpable. Such epistemic points are addressed in this chapter.",

The conventions may come from the remote past, perhaps attributed to the ancestors, to a noted law-giver, or to the deity.

But whether willingly or grudgingly obeyed, the conventions give the community its character. Therefore any infringement endangers the community. Accidental or careless infringements can be dealt with by simple penalties; defiant infringements are more difficult – but processes of atonement are in general available. If, however, major disagreement arises about the validity of the conventions, or if an external power tries to substitute alien conventions, then the community may resist, suffer, and accept martyrdom.",

      "title": "Self-Injurers as Loners: The Social Organization of Solitary Deviance",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper we examine the social organization of people who deliberately destroy or damage their own body tissue without suicidal intent. Best and Luckenbill (Citation1982) have proposed two typologies of deviance performed by solitary actors: loners, who lack the regular association with fellow deviants and have no membership in a deviant subculture, and individual deviants, who are the actors and objects of their behaviors, yet socialize with others like them. Based on a convenience sample of 40 in-depth interviews with people who self-cut, burn, brand, scratch, bite, and bone-break, we describe and analyze the way their behaviors correspond to and differ from other forms of individual and loner deviance. Notes 1While people may do a variety of almost unimaginable things to themselves, such as self-amputating, drilling holes into their skulls, intentionally making themselves ill (Munchausen Syndrome), and decorating their bodies in extremely radical ways, these behaviors fall outside of the behaviors clinically associated with the specific syndrome known best at the turn of the twenty-first century as self-injury. We therefore restrict our focus to these practices not arbitrarily, but because they have been traditionally associated together in the medical literature and because they are performed by a constant group of people. In other words, people who intentionally make themselves ill or who cut off their limbs are not the same people who cut or burn themselves, and people who get tattooed or scarified come from a dramatically different etiology than people who self-injure, despite the fact that members of both groups may carve words or designs into themselves. These are different phenomena practiced by different people. 2Suyemoto and Macdonald (1995) also noted that most self-injurers desisted after adolescence. 3We were not permitted to interview participants under the age of 18 without parental consent, which blocked many current self-injurers from the study, as most ceased the behavior by the age of 18, and few under that age revealed their behavior to their parents. In addition, we were blocked from interviewing current students, who were the most frequent volunteers for our sample, and by making people wait a semester to be interviewed, we lost participants who transferred, moved away, or lost their nerve to participate in the research. 4Estimations of participants' cessation come from their own self-reports and may therefore not be completely accurate. 5They thus had many demographic similarities to the population of individuals with eating disorders. 6Some of the self-injurers we interviewed were neither loners nor individual deviants. Out of the 39 people we spoke with, three were clearly not loners because even though they performed the acts on themselves, they cut, branded, burned, or even electro-shocked themselves socially, in the company of one or more friends. Several more knew and spoke with others who self-injured, although their associations with them were deliberately limited. One of our participants was not an individual deviant, because he required the participation of others to perform the act (he and his friends held hands and electro-shocked themselves in a chain off of a generator or an electrical socket). These outliers are not the main focus of this paper, and they are probably rare, so for the main we will not include them in our descriptions and analyses. 7Some popular treatments that came to public attention leading up to or around this time included films such as \"Girl Interrupted,\" \"Nightmare on Elm Street III,\" and \"Secretary,\" television shows with episodes on cutting such as \"ER,\" documentary treatments on The Learning Channel, popular songs such as \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails, \"Crawling\" by Linkin Park, \"Back to the Coast\" by Nikki Sudden, \"Last Resort\" by Papa Roach, and personal revelations from Richey Edwards, the guitarist and songwriter for Manic Street Preachers. See also Egan (Citation1997). 8Some of these included people such as Johnny Depp, Drew Barrymore, Angelina Jolie, Christina Ricci, Fiona Apple, Richey Edwards, Courtney Love, Marilyn Manson, Shirley Manson, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and Princess Diana. 9Hodgson (Citation2004) also talked about people who learned about self-injury from others as a route into the behavior. 10People weaned themselves from self-injury in much the same ways Granfield and Cloud (Citation1999) discussed drug addicts overcoming addiction without treatment. 11One social self-injurer was drawn in by a member of the other gender into a series of coupled sessions, where they cut and licked each others' blood. This was defined as very erotic. 12Rosenthal et al. (1972) found, in contrast, that over half of the 18 participants they studied made their cuts on Friday or Saturday nights, with another peak occurring on Wednesday afternoon. 13Favazza (1996) also noted that some self-injurers do not feel the pain from their body mutilation. 14Out of curiosity he used the knife later to try to cut himself. He wanted to experience the benefits of the self-injury firsthand. Yet, lacking the angst that brought most self-injurers to their behavior, all he got were some scars and a lot of pain. He offers an interesting example of a \"failed cutter.\" 15This sentiment clearly became more widespread, as self-injury diffused through the culture and websites devoted to it sprang up in the early 2000s. In a future work (Adler and Adler, in preparation), we discuss the proliferation of website chatting about self-injury, and the types of interactions and support people offer each other via these anonymous and distant, yet frequent, regular, and often intimate internet relationships and communities. 16Solomon and Farrand (1996) also reported a case where a young woman chose self-injury as an alternative to suicide, considering the former preferable. 17In this, self-injurers resemble the shifts and oscillations of deviants trying unsuccessfully to quit the deviant world but being drawn back in, only to foray out and relapse once again (see Adler and Adler 1983). 18In describing the self-injury of the cutters she studied, Hodgson (2004) also noted that they used non-normative means to appear normal.",

      "abstract": "Historic moments usually culminate one long series of events and begin another. One such moment came in 1687 with the publication of Newton's Principia. Dramatically positioned at the head of Book 1 were the three laws.I. Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion straight ahead, unless it be compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.II. The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed, and it takes place along the right line in which that force is impressed.III. To an action there is always a contrary and equal reaction, or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts.By taut and clear deductions from these laws Newton summed up a century's work on the motion of one or two bodies in a vacuum. \"What Newton writes is correct, clear, and short. In earlier works the brilliant diamonds of discovery lie concealed in an opaque matrix of wordy special cases, laborious details, metaphysics, confusion, and error; while Newton follows a vein of pure gold.\"Unlike his work on the one and two body problems, Newton's work on the three body problem was not centered on the formulation and solution of the governing differential equations. Indeed \"he shows no sign of an attempt to set up equations of motion. That he obtained some correct inequalities and groped his way to the major approximate results under this handicap is one more tribute to his peerless grasp of the physical essence of mechanics and to the might of his brain. It does not show, however, that his formulation of the general laws of mechanics was adequate. History proves the contrary.\" Further progress on the three body problem required formulation of the general equations of celestial mechanics and these equations were not published until 1749 (by Euler).",

      "title": "The Significance of Names in Ghanaian Drama",
      "abstract": "The significance attached to names and naming in Ghanaian society is remarkable; it is strikingly different from what obtains in Euro-American cultures. Names of peoples, objects, spirits, and God tend to emanate from the interplay of religious, mythical, social, and historical realities (Abraham, 1962). Individuals are named on the basis of the culture's expectations and identification of the personality so named with particular clan or genealogical groups beliefs, birth order and circumstance, status, and attributes (Quartey-Papafio, 1913). For example, the Akan call a male child born on Saturday Kwame. A child doomed to cyclical birth and death is named Bejina (come and stay) and one whose paternity is not acknowledged or who is born to aging parents is called Nyame Kye (God's gift). Asante military tactics and Ga striking power are celebrated in the appellations Asante Kotoko (Asante the Porcupines) and Gagaa (Ga the Soldier Ants), respectively. This system of nomenclature seems to be the basic one subscribed to by many other African peoples including the Yoruba, Ewe, Igbo, Hausa, and African-Americans. Though the elaborate and formalized naming pattern may have been lost among the latter the African presence is maintained through the AfricanAmerican's widespread use of epithets, bynames, and nicknames (Asante, 1987, p. 73). Naming has colored the writing and artistic works of Africans, from earlier generations to contemporary times. What is lacking, though, is a systematic study of the nature and qualities of such nominal colorations as they arise from the various parts of the African world. The present article is a modest contribution in this",

      "title": "THE HAPPINESS AND THE GOOD: ECCENTRICITY AND CENTRIPETALITY",
      "abstract": "Happiness is always a good for a person: even if a person lacks some other goods, material or spiritual, a person can be happy. We can say that happiness to some extent can compensate for the lack of certain goods. A person is unhappy not when one does not know his center and boundaries, but when one cannot have power over them. Happiness is not rather in the retention of goods, but in the free possession of them. This rule is emphasized by rare exceptions from it: these include a person's dependence on the good of communication with spiritually close ones, relatives, loved ones, friends. Happiness is not a constant escape, but rather a constant learning of happiness. Person uses his / her eccentricity to find his / her new center each time, not to lose it or lose faith in it. Changing one's borders is also not unlimited and completely arbitrary. All this must also be learned, because the loss of goods is also bitter, especially if involuntary or, moreover, against our will, and the loss of some goods is the loss of our very life – organic and / or spiritual. Happiness is in the unity of eccentricity and centripetal of some personality: in the constant rejection of the unchanging center and boundaries of one's personality and at the same time in the constant search and new discoveries that partially reaffirm this center and boundaries – but as a result of one's own choice. Keywords: happiness, goods, eccentricity, centripetality, learning of happiness.",

      "title": "How to be wise and compassionate in working for peace through health.",
      "abstract": "As a species, we are prone to share, help, and cooperate with each other, especially in our families and their extensions to the group we consider “like us.” We are equipped with a humanitarian impulse – when someone is in distress, we want to come to their aid. Slowly, the circle of compassion, to use Einstein’s wonderful term, has widened and until now it is globe-encompassing. With our technologically-enhanced capacity to know what is happening in Bhutan or New Orleans and our enhanced ability to respond, we, or at least some of us, want to share, help, and relieve distress all over the world.\r\n\r\nWe have moved even further, and decided that these are not optional charitable impulses, but duties, and that those with insufficient resources or security and those in distress from natural or man-made disaster have a right to receive help. People have a right to development (a share of resources at least to levels of sufficiency) (1), in particular a right to health (2), a right to peace (to live without being attacked, oppressed or exploited) (3), and to humanitarian assistance (4), although this last is incompletely institutionalized in international law.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most wonderful aspects of humanity, and we are deeply inspired by those who enact such giving. However, we must attend to problems that arise in giving across distances and to people who are not like us, problems such as an assumption of superiority of the giver over the recipient, especially if reciprocity is thought to be unlikely (this can be seen even in families); an assumption by the giver of no reciprocity if the recipient is materially poor; erroneous assumptions about what is wanted or needed, with inadequate consultation with the recipient about this; cultural blindness (unawareness that cultural differences between giver and recipient will determine a great deal about the meaning of actions and words); unawareness that changes to (possibly volatile) social, political, or economic dynamics may entrain negative consequences, especially in a situation of resource poverty and conflict (5); and problems with people in any situation handling large-scale resources with insufficient accountability.\r\n\r\nMary Anderson has carefully researched situations where poorly informed projects intended to help have actually harmed the recipients. Her famous “Do No Harm” (5) is required reading for all who would try to help.\r\n\r\nKen Bush has developed the now much-used Peace and Conflict Impact Assessment (PCIA) for enhancing the sensitivity of project workers working in conflict situations (6,7). This process, which is intended to be used before, during, and after a project, structures an examination of the risks and opportunities presented by the conflictual context on the project, and then an examination of the impact of the project on the conflict. Based on an analysis of the conflict, the project team, which is expected to include local people, examines the potential impact of the project on the following areas: (a) conflict management capacities of individuals, groups or the state; (b) militarized violence and human security; (c) political structures and good governance in both state and civil society, including structures of accountability and strengthening of human rights measures; (d) economic structures and processes, such as whether the project counters or strengthens a war economy, increases or decreases dependence on the military for employment; and (e) social empowerment, such as impact on gender equity.\r\n\r\nBush gives detailed examples of positive and negative impacts in all of these areas and emphasizes the potential of development projects to enhance peace. It is coming to be considered a necessary element of good practice for those working in conflict zones to incorporate a “conflict-sensitive approach” (8).\r\n\r\nAnne Birouste and Anthony Zwi at University of New South Wales School of Community Medicine and Public Health have worked on a tool more specifically for Peace through Health projects. It is, for now, called the Health and Peacebuilding Filter (9), and is intended to call to mind for the donor, project worker, or recipient all the necessary dimensions of a project based on compassion and deep respect for all involved, together with acknowledgment of the complexity of the context of such projects.\r\n\r\nThe “filter” attends to five broad dimensions needed for an excellent project. These dimensions are cultural sensitivity, conflict sensitivity, social justice, social cohesion, and good governance.",

      "title": "Anger and its Management",
      "abstract": "Everybody feels anger from time to time. People have been documented feeling anger since biblical times when God was considered angry. Babies even exhibit signs that are interpreted as anger, such as crying or screaming. Anger is not in any way unique to people. Animals also have the ability to feel and express anger. In our personal lives we get angry over at least one thing on almost a daily basis, whether it is on thejob, with a spouse or loved one, or perhaps with a figure of authority. Anger is a healthy emotion when it is expressed appropriately. When it is not, it can have devastating effects. Anger is at the root of many personal and social problems, e.g. child abuse, domestic violence, physical and verbal abuse and community violence etc. Problematic interpersonal relations may also disrupt employment activities because of the interference of anger on workplace performance. Anger can destroy relationships, obstruct problem solving skills, and increase social withdrawal. Anger also affects our physical health. For example, it can tax our immune system; contribute to headaches, migraines, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Anger is a healthy and valid emotion. But many of us are taught not to express or show our anger. There's no doubt about it: we live in an angry society. Signs that anger abounds are all over the place. There is desk rage, road rage, spousal abuse, sports rage and most recently spam rage. Anger is a worldwide phenomenon and referrals to anger management programs have exploded since. Present paper attempt to explore anger and its remedial aspects in a theoretical context.",

      "title": "On the Counterfactual Dimension of Negative Liberty",
      "abstract": "This article explores some implications of the counterfactual aspect of freedom and unfreedom. Because actions can be unprevented even if they are not undertaken, and conversely because actions can be prevented even if they are not attempted and are thus not overtly thwarted, any adequate account of negative liberty must ponder numerous counterfactual chains of events. Each person's freedom or unfreedom is affected not only by what others in fact do, but also by what they are disposed to do. Their dispositions play a key role in determining whether the abilities and inabilities of each person would continue as such if the person's conduct or situation were altered in various respects. Until one knows whether people would or would not have acted in certain ways if a given person had sought to do something, one cannot know whether that person was free to do that thing. Nor can one know whether the person was free to perform that action in combination with manifold subsequent actions. Thus, whether tacit or explicit, counterfactual scenarios are indispensable for any enquiry into a person's liberty. By relying (albeit perhaps only implicitly) on such scenarios, which trace how people are disposed to act vis-a-vis one another, one takes account of the central role of unmanifested dispositions in setting the bounds of people's sociopolitical freedom. Among the principal theorists whose work is critically examined in this article are Hillel Steiner, Ian Carter, and G.A. Cohen.",

      "title": "Ethological strategies for defence in animals and humans: Their role in some psychiatric disorders",
      "abstract": "Ethological strategies for defence in animals and humans are expressed as either aggression or flight behaviour. Aggression is employed by animals during intraspecific competition for resources, mate, territory and acquiring and maintaining social status. It also disperses individuals throughout the biotope. Flight behaviour is used to avoid a source of danger or harm, has both dynamic and static forms, is phylogenetically very old and takes precedence over all other activities including social behaviour. Animals exposed to inescapable threats or attacks exhibit a characteristic defensive strategy, arrested flight, which consists of gaze‐avoidance or cut‐offs, cryptic postures such as immobility and covert surveillance of their surroundings. Arrested flight also occurs in social encounters when submission fails to reduce attacks, and in prey animals when escape from a predator is hampered. Ethological studies show that during interviews, depressed patients exhibit a pattern of non‐verbal behaviour having all the hallmarks of arrested flight. Cut‐off behaviour, which seeks to reduce the input of flight‐evoking stimuli is especially evident in these patients but takes an extreme form, i.e. eye closure, in the gaze‐profiles of paranoid patients. It is proposed that cut‐offs always denote the presence of incipient flight and that arrested flight is a ‘last measure’ defensive strategy in response to inescapable proximal threat. It can arise in humans whenever their escape routes are hampered and characterizes the behaviour of patients suffering from depression. As in animals, different pathways may lead to arrested flight in humans. In humans, defensive mechanisms also operate at the mental level through putative ego defences, the psychological function of which is to preserve self‐esteem by hindering the access of disturbing emotional material into awareness. It is suggested that they function ethologically as mental cut‐offs analogous to the behavioural cut‐offs in animals.",

      "abstract": "Ownership, a sociocultural concept experienced at an intrapersonal level as thoughts and feelings than an object is mine; is an important feature of our daily experience. However, norms and laws define our behaviour in response to others’ belongings. Research is beginning to elucidate that the ownership status of an object, whether an object is mine or yours, influences a range of cognitive processes. Findings generally indicate that objects associated with the self receive prioritised processing, compared with objects associated with others. However, within the lesser investigated cognitive domain of action production, there is some initial evidence to suggest that we are sensitive to other’s belongings; with knowledge of self and other-ownership modulating the visuomotor system. Therefore, the present thesis aimed to extend these findings in two key ways. Firstly, on the basis of indirect evidence obtained from movement kinematics, by investigating whether ownership mediates the tendency to approach or avoid objects. Secondly, by investigating the influence of ownership status in an action context yet to be considered: during the avoidance of obstacles within the workspace. \r\nBroadly, this thesis presents findings consistent with indirect evidence that ownership status does influence approach and avoidance behaviour; and evidence that the visuomotor system possesses some sensitivity to the ownership status of obstacles as we navigate the workspace. However, in accordance with previous work, the effects obtained, particularly in relation to other-ownership, were sensitive to task context. In addition, alternative explanations of self-ownership effects (for example, resulting from attentional mechanisms) were difficult to fully discount using indirect measures, such as response time. Therefore, while adding to the limited body of research concerning the effects of ownership on the visuomotor system; the current work highlights the need for future research concerning motoric effects to recruit more direct measures of action-related processes.",

      "title": "CAFERİ MEZHEBİNDE ÖRF VE SĪRA ‘UQALĀİYYA ( AKLA DAYALI ÇIKARIM) DELİLLERİ ARASINDAKİ ETKİLEŞİMİN ZAMANSAL ANALİZİ",
      "abstract": "In the Ja‘farī school of law, jurisprudence is not conceived as a civil act, but is instead held to be a religious practice that orientates towards eschatology and theology. The scholarly focus has converged upon the proposition that human society would not reach the true path and salvation unless limitations on the actions and appetites of each individual were first put in place by Islamic ideology (that is explained by the Prophet and Imams). From the point of Ja‘farī scholars, God has sought to impose boundaries upon human activity by putting in place five categories which encompass positive law in its entirety: absolutely forbidden actions (ḥarām), indispensable or expressly commanded actions (wājib or farḍ), admissible or permitted actions (mubāḥ), recommended or desired actions (mustaḥabb or mandūb) and reprehensible or offensive actions (makrūh). In the absence of solutions or rulings that can be achieved through the application of legal texts and methods, the principle of custom (‘urf) emerges as a valid source in response to the impossibility of restricting social issues that pertain to the jurisprudence. At this point, the resort to ‘urf which is applied as a legal principle in urgent circumstances may become an indispensable part of Islamic law that helps to validate the given solution or to categorise the permissible acts within the Ja‘farī school of law. The application of ‘urf might be considered as an affirmation of the position which holds that primary issues of faith (i‘tikād) should be determined with reference to the original Islamic sources including the Qur’an, the Sunna, icmā’ (consensus), ‘aql (reason) according to Ja‘farī school of law. However, here, it should be remembered that the scholars frequently advocate flexible and pragmatic approaches in the sphere of social relations (mu‘āmalāt). The implementation process of rules for cases pertaining to social relations can be said to have given credence to ‘urf being applied directly as a legal principle or as a subsidiary factor that relates to the interpretation of various legal principles. It is quite conceivable that the application of ‘urf will result in changes to legal methodologies and temporary legal rulings that had previously given by the early scholars of Ja‘farī school of law. The flexible nature of Islamic law in the scope of mu‘āmalāt authorises the scholars to interpret the legal sources (in harmony with the necessities of time and place) by using various legal methodologies. It is in fact the case that scholars are required to acknowledge the changing needs and habits of contemporary time during the jurisdiction process by preserving the formal framework of religious sanctity. The scholars have sought to set out the principles in more detail along with the conditions of their implementation. These principles relate to cases in which the true ordinance of God is not clear or deduced from the main sources of Islamic law. At the initial and foundational periods of the school, the classical Ja‘farī scholars openly referred to ‘urf as an independent source of ruling. However, the scholars of later and contemporary period have avoided to address ‘urf directly but prepared a substructure with ‘urf in order to use it during the interpretation of procedural and secondary sources. Among these sources, especially the principle of sīra ‘uqalā’iyya has gained a prestigious position and expanded the range of its validity in legal area according to explanations of recent Ja‘farī scholars. The principle of sīra ‘uqalā’iyya in operating as a legal constraint, prioritises the local conditions of the region and simultaneously operates at the level of theory and practice. The analogical and etymological comparison between the principles of ‘urf and sīra ‘uqalā’iyya clarifies that ‘urf (which finds its origin in the daily practices of people) is considered more vulnerable than and sīra ‘uqalā’iyya (which finds its roots in the rational practices of people).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Our basic assumption is that children’s talk about the mind can reveal their conceptions of the mind. Specifically, we assume that at least some uses of terms such as think, know, and want can reveal the speaker’s understanding of beliefs and desires, core concepts in an everyday theory of mind. An example might be Mark’s statement above that “he thought there were haunted things in his house.” Of course, charting children’s concepts by examining their everyday language is not simple. On the one hand, children (and adults) may use terms like think, know, or want without any conception of, or reference to, beliefs and desires. For example, they might learn to say “Know what?” to gain a listener’s attention without any deeper understanding of notions such as knowledge or knowing. Or they might say “I don’t know” in a ritualistic way, as perhaps Ross does above. On the other hand, children might understand something of beliefs and desires but never talk about them. Or they might talk about such mental states but never use conventional terms like think and want. In these ways, among others, children’s language might underestimate or overestimate their understanding.",

You practice arts of the self after, say, you have acknowledged that some element in your faith promotes unnecessary suffering for others and/or is inconsonant with other prized elements.

      "abstract": "Abstract An asymmetry effect is known to exist in the estimation of interpersonal distance, depending on whether the point of reference for the estimation is the subject (‘How far are the others from you?’) or the others How far are you from the others?). It looks as though, through the effect of a self‐centring schema, subjects feel that others occupy their own space more than they occupy the space of others. A self‐centring schema has also been found in many other processes involving judgment or comparison of oneself and others. It is generally interpreted as a sign of the affirmation and defence of personal identity. The three experiments reported here attempt to relate the asymmetries in the distances perceived between persons represented on a map to the following three areas in which one's sense of personal or group identity is involved: (1) in the perception of one's own specificity with respect to others (or of the specificity of the group to which one belongs with respect to other groups) (experiment 1), (2) in one's ability to put oneself in the place of others (exocentrism) (experiment 2). and (3) in the individuation of oneself by others (experiment 3). The results of these three experiments lead us to believe that it is indeed the processes of identification and affirmation of personal and group identity ‐ along with the underlying categorization processes — that are the source of the asymmetries observed in interpersonal distance estimation. The consistency of the data obtained in different situations also validates the technique used for estimating interpersonal distance.",

      "title": "Violence: No Silver Bullet",
      "abstract": "From the neighborhood bully berating a meek classmate to the rhesus macaque screaming at a rival, displays of aggression are the weapon of choice throughout the animal kingdom for asserting dominance, challenging a higher ranking individual, or laying claim to food, water, and other resources. Most of the time, these conflicts are resolved peacefully. But on occasion harsh words and snarls escalate into left jabs and maulings. Why do individuals become violent, and how can we prevent them from injuring others or themselves? These are the central questions explored in this Special Issue on Violence.\n\nFirst, a disclaimer. This issue does not attempt to penetrate all the ugly visages of violence, purposefully ignoring, for instance, violence inflicted by predators upon their prey, human cruelty to animals, and that uniquely human capacity for waging war. Rather, the following collection of News stories and research Reviews focuses on violence directed by individuals against members of their own kind.\n\nStudying violence can be risky in its own right, at least to one's reputation. Many years ago the field was rife with theories such as phrenology, which held that personality traits, including violent tendencies, could be divined from the shape of the skull. But even while modern-day violence researchers have succeeded in distancing themselves from the discredited ideas of their predecessors, an ill-formulated comparison of inner city violence and the “jungle”—which some saw as equating black youths with monkeys—in the early 1990s helped ignite a fire storm of protest over studies on the biological roots of violence. Although hampered by the controversy, a small band of researchers is pursuing provocative theories that implicate dysfunction of serotonin-containing brain circuits in violent behavior (see News story by Enserink on p. [575][1] and the Review by Davidson et al. on p. [591][2]); suggest that violence is pathological, in that it is “normal” aggression gone awry (see News story by Pennisi on p. [576][3] and the Review by de Waal on p. [586][4]); and indicate that violent tendencies can begin to develop in early infancy (see News story by Holden on p. [580][5]).\n\nSocial scientists, on the other hand, have benefited from increased federal support for research aimed in part at pinpointing which antiviolence interventions work in which settings, one positive development in the aftermath of the tragedy at Columbine High School last year (see News story by Marshall on p. [570][6]). Were Columbine and other recent school shootings symptoms of a diseased society? In fact, since the early 1990s, violent crime rates have declined in the United States, although rates remain substantially higher than in Europe (see News story by Hagmann on p. [572][7]). Teasing out the factors that drive the ebb and flow of U.S. violent crime rates may help predict future trends and point to productive interventions (see Editorial by Blumstein on p. [545][8] and News story by Helmuth on p. [582][9]), while profiling the personalities of victims—such as the type of police officer more likely to die in the line of duty—could help protect vulnerable subpopulations (see News story by Stokstad on p. [584][10]).\n\nThere is no silver bullet capable of neutralizing the biological or psychological triggers that set an individual on a path toward violence. Indeed, it's still unclear how much animal studies can reveal about our own capacity for violence. But ultimately, researchers are bound to converge on a common goal: Deeper knowledge of the biology of violence will help social scientists match violence-prone individuals with intervention programs that can steer them onto a path toward conciliation and respect for the sanctity of life.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.575\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.591\n [3]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.576\n [4]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.586\n [5]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.580\n [6]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.570\n [7]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.572\n [8]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.545\n [9]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.582\n [10]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.289.5479.584",

      "abstract": "Are we morally justified in killing fish and if so, for what purposes? We do not focus on the suffering that is done during the killing, but on the question whether death itself is harmful for fish. We need to distinguish two questions; first, can death be considered a harm for fish? And second, if it is a harm, how much of a harm is it? In order to answer the first question, we explore four lines of reasoning: (1) fish desire to stay alive; (2) something valuable is lost when fish are killed; (3) death deprives fish of future happiness or goods; (4) killing fish reflects badly on our character. Some argue that we should not kill animals if they desire to stay alive and that a being can form a desire to stay alive only when it has the capacity to be aware of itself as a distinct entity existing over time. We cast doubt on this view: Do we value continued life because it is desirable or do we desire continued life because it is valuable? It seems more plausible that it is not the desire to live that matters, but being able to enjoy goods, and death thwarts future opportunities for enjoyment. This would entail that a being can have an interest in continued life, without actively being interested in it. Next, we discuss the second question of how harmful death is for fish. A widely shared intuition is that it is worse to kill a human being or mammal than a fish, because human or mammal life is in our view more valuable. But how can we account for this intuition? Finally, we address some implications of the view that killing fish is harmful.",

      "abstract": "Many objects that we encounter have typical material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft, and Jell-O dessert is wobbly. Over a lifetime of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough, or pink an object is, but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when pulled apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object's kinematics (i.e., its physical [atypical] motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes \"pulled\" toward the \"native\" motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in response time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance.",

      "abstract": "Both folk and scientific psychology assume that mental events and properties participate in causal relations. However, considerations involving the causal completeness of physics and the apparent non-reducibility of mental phenomena to physical phenomena have challenged these assumptions. In the case of mental events (such as someone’s thinking about Vienna), one proposal has been simply to identify not ‘types’ (or classes) of mental events with types of physical events, but merely individual ‘token’ mental events with token physical ones, one by one (your and my thinking about Vienna may be ‘realized’ by different type physical states). The role of mental properties (such as ‘being about Vienna’) in causation is more problematic. Properties are widely thought to have three features that seem to render them causally irrelevant: (1) they are ‘multiply-realizable’ (they can be realized in an indefinite variety of substances); (2) many of them seem not to supervene on neurophysiological properties (differences in mental properties do not always depend merely on differences in neurophysiological ones, but upon relations people bear to things outside their skin); and (3) many of them (for example, ‘being painful’) seem inherently ‘subjective’ in a way that no objective physical properties seem to be. All of these issues are complicated by the fact that there is no consensus concerning the nature of causal relevance for properties in general.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Past research demonstrates that reminders of one’s own mortality can lead to materialistic and self-serving consumer behaviors. In contrast, across five studies, we explore a condition under which mortality salience (MS) leads to increased tendency to give away one’s possessions—when the donation act is high in transcendence potential. We propose and find that consumers are more likely to donate their possessions to charity under MS (vs. comparison conditions) when the product is considered highly (vs. not highly) connected to the self. Moreover, we demonstrate that this tendency manifests only when transcendence is attainable through donation. In support of the proposition of transcendence as the underlying mechanism, the observed effects are attenuated under conditions where: (1) transcendence has already been satiated via alternative means or (2) the donated possession will not transcend the self (i.e., its physical integrity is lost by being broken down and recycled). The theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.",

In psychoanalytic practice, analysts encounter a variety of patients who operate at different levels of anxiety or desire in regards to their objects. Some patients who exhibit control and conviction about self and object demonstrate borderline and narcissistic disorders that revolve around more persecutory phantasies. There are also patients who face a constant depressive and persecutory threat to themselves and their precious objects. They rely heavily upon idealization and projective identification to traverse their psychological standoff against these overwhelming anxieties. The subsequent defenses that are always in overuse to sustain the brittle ideal self or object and to prevent the aggressive, envious self from breaking through actually cause either the death/damage of the object or the rise of a persecutory object. Often it can be both, creating a dual fear and phantasy of loss and persecution.",

An agent might be depicted using such rites to cause a foe or wrongdoer injury. But texts suggest that under a different set of conditions, the very same rites can have beneficial functions not only for the agents who undertake them but also for those on whom those agents might act ritually. Circumstantially dependent rites include hair manipulation, disinterment and the movement of the remains of the dead, the burning of corpses or bones, and circumcision. Such rites contrast with other ritual acts that are portrayed as injurious to a victim under any and all circumstances (e.g., public stripping or blinding) as well as rites that always produce some kind of benefit for both agent and patient (e.g., honorable burial or clothing the naked).",

      "title": "Queer/Disabled Existence: Human Rights of People with Disability",
      "abstract": "The literature has sometimes portrayed queer/disabled people as the “Other.” People with disabilities and queer sexualities are frequently subject to ridicule and abuse. Historically, the literature has aided in the social constructionism of disability phenomena in society by depicting the disabled as someone harmful and undesirable. Furthermore, traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence have frequently been biased and are usually about how the “able-bodied” or the so-called normal people perceive people with diverse bodies and queer sexualities. However, it has been conspicuously silent regarding the plight of people with disabilities and queer sexualities. In a departure from traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence, Firdaus Kanga presents a first-hand account of the lived experiences of his precarious life in the Indian sociocultural context and beyond. He has to his credit a series of critically acclaimed books such as Trying to Grow (1990), Heaven on Wheels (1991), The Godmen (1995), and The Surprise Ending (1996). As a severely disabled individual suffering from a crippling disease called osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bones disease), Trying to Grow (1990), a semiautobiographical novel, is a narrative of his lived experiences of disability and tryst with queer sexuality. While his other work, Heaven on Wheels (1991), is a discourse on queer sexuality and disability from the perspective of queer and disabled existence. Kanga critiques the ableist society’s treatment of the queer and the disabled, which is tantamount to human rights abuse.",

Dalam hal ini manusia bukan makhluk manipulative, koruptif, perusak dan yang semacamnya. Artinya bahwa manusia selalu berusaha agar cara berfikir mereka dan tindakannya benar, tidak sembarangan dan serampangan. Dalam actus humanus kebebasan mengendalikan 2 hal yaitu tahu dan mau artinya, hanya apabila manusia itu mengetahui dan menghendaki, ia disebut manusia bebas, dan dengan demikian ia bertanggung jawab atasnya. Dalam melakukan tindakannya ini para pelaku pengeboman pasti dirinya tahu yang akan ia lakukan saat pengeboman tersebut. Dengan cara para pelaku pengeboman tersebut sebelum melakukan aksi nya pasti sipelaku pengeboman memilki tujuan untuk dapat menghilangkan nyawa orang lain yang berada disekitar bahkan nyawa dari sipelaku tersebut dapat hilang atau mati. MAU secara bebas artinya dalam kasus pengeboman di Surabaya ini tindakan para pelaku telah dikehendakinya dan telah diingankan oleh para pelaku sehigga dapat menjadi suatu dorongan bagi para pelaku dalam melakukan tindakannya yang sangat nekad tersebut. Dari segi hati nurani sesat tindakan seorang pelaku bom bunuh diri di dasarkan pada suatu ajaran atau perintah yang telah dianut oleh pelaku bom bunuh diri. Para pelaku bom bunuh diri ini setelah melakukan tindakan membunuh dirinya sendiri mereka menyakinini bahwa kematiannya tersebut akan mendapatkan suatu kehormatan atau pahala.",

      "abstract": "Suppose a stranger throws himself in front of a car to save the life of a child about to be run over or a dying wealthy man decides to give all his wealth to charity at no gains to himself. What motivates that stranger to act, causing absolute harm to himself and death with no reward received in return? What motivates the dying man who has nothing to gain from charity decide to give away his fortunes to complete strangers? One answer is pure altruism, the selfless concern for others’ well-being at the cost of one’s own well-being, time, or energy. This would be a satisfactory answer that seems to have been accepted society, that selflessness can truly exist. However, there are serious concerns about the selfless aspect of altruism with some scholars, such as evolutionary psychologists and proponents of the social exchange theory, claiming that it is not merely unlikely for it to exist, but that it is outright impossible, while others counter these claims be it through innate, biologically, or religious conviction of divinely acquired selflessness or Batson’s infamous empathy-altruism hypothesis. Regardless of which route one takes, the means to the end do not require proper identification to notice that humans do participate in behavior that penalizes them and benefits others, but the question is can and do they do so independently of self-interest?",

Many moral philosophers, unfortunately, seem to agree with them, to the extent, at any rate, of taking it for granted that there is some one divison of actions into two classes, which division is of some especial or even unique significance. Actions, they have supposed, are either right or wrong. If they are right, then they must and ought to be done, and to do them is our duty. If they are wrong, then they must not and ought not to be done, and it is our duty not to do them. If we do what is right, and do this because it is right, and not just because it suits us, then we have performed a morally good action, and we deserve praise or commendation. If we have done something which is wrong, then we have performed a morally bad action, and deserveblame, and possibly punishment. Finally, a man manifests his moral goodness by performing, from a sense of duty, those actions which belong to the first class, and omitting those which belong to the second class; since there are no other ways in which actions may be classified morally, he has ample oppo tunity for exercising his talents, and the morally good man, or the conscientious man, or the dutiful man, becomes the archetype of what a man ought to be.",

In both cases, the presumption can be defeated, as we learn more and get into specifics. We still might insist that to be genuinely virtuous is to be able to pass the more familiar sorts of tests of virtue, and to be reliably virtuous also in the ordinary business of life, especially in things that really matter. Something like this is a necessary condition for virtue. Factors of motivation, especially those related to what a person's basic concerns are, can vary enormously. Imagine an extreme case. Someone might be inherently indifferent to what happens to other people, and have no sense of the inherent dignity or worthiness of moral principles, but also be totally convinced that God is watching his or her every move, and that the prospects of heaven or hell depend heavily on one's following accepted morality at every step.",

      "title": "Anxiety, Freedom and Democracy",
      "abstract": "Arousing anxiety is one of the most important instruments of tyranny. Arousing anxiety is a weapon used not only by dictatorial societies, but also by the dictators of the family, school, workplace or organization. The essence of anxiety is the inability to actively control situations perceived as threatening —the experience of this lack of control and the inability to avert the impending threat causes this situation. In the interest of preserving and strengthening their power, the person or group possessing crucial information is able to withdraw the possibility of control, or to portion it out as a reward; in this way anxiety is aroused in those affected. Arousing anxiety is not only an instrument, but can also be the essence of the exercise of power for its own sake. Tyrannical power wishes to ensure full freedom of decision for itself at all times and it therefore does not commit itself, not even in the form of an agreement serving its own interests. This is true for all relationships of dependency in which the more independent partner is able to withhold information, thereby keeping the other partner in a state of “loss of control”. If the plumber does not turn up at the time agreed and does not inform us of this beforehand, if the garage does not repair the car on the grounds of a shortage of spare parts despite the fact that they have parts, we are placed in a state of powerlessness. We encounter various forms of abuse of power and induced anxiety day after day, but do not pay sufficient attention to it, do not recognise it in its essence and do not understand how this slow-acting poison kills. However, we can also arrive at a psychological definition of freedom and democracy through an understanding of the essence of arousing anxiety and of anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Panic is a condition in which an individual can arrive suddenly when in its environment different stimuli appear, meaning excitatory factors which may cause a reaction to the body, more or less controlled. This can be amplified by another person or by a group that is subject to the same stimuli, usually transforming it in a violent terror. In this case, the judgment of an individual comes to be dominated only by the primary instinct of survival forgetting about others. In the category of stimuli that can cause panic are: fires, earthquakes, impossibility to leave a space, various transportation accidents, an outbreak infection etc. That means that the spaces in which crowded situations appear must be designed so that emergency evacuation, when panic stimuli arise, to occur normally with no injuries or casualties. Such situations can be prevented by sufficient exits properly signposted and calibrated with respect to their maximum capacity and through education. Education is extremely important and must be repeated regularly in order to replace fear with individual judgment. Unfortunately, this is superficially considered by the authorities leaving everything to those who conceive the buildings. Moreover, there are some special buildings that are not taken into account, such as churches, which have only one exit. Evacuation scenarios can be simulated only by specialised software in which certain parameters, such as stampede, the appearance of human or material obstacles, etc., are difficult to enter. This paper proposes some ways of adapting the existing software sin order to meet specific requirements, leading to delays in people evacuation in case of panic stimuli.",

Impacting social ministry to overcome every problem faced by human and at once save them from sin and eternal punishment, which was offered by God to human, through salvation in The Lord Jesus Christ. In the beginning God created human and gave peace to them, life comfort with natural surrounding. God gave human a cultural mandate, that is: to be fruitful, to work and look after the earth. Human was given authority to have benefit of all God’s worked at universe (Gen. 1:28); to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground (Gen. 1:26). However, in fact, human has strayed and far from God’s former purpose. Humans’ Imago Dei has been broken; that’s why most required the act of God for mission and social ministry. Mission and social ministry are interrelated act. Mission is as God’s great act to save human race, so called Missio Dei. God also act to look after human and universe surround from their damages. Many problems arise like: sin, behavior tend to crime, moral decadence, sickness, poverty, social inequality, racial discrimination, political deviant, and every life suffering, also natural disasters are human failures of managing the universe. Human as social being or “Homo Social”, means that human was created by God couldn’t live alone. Human life requires: other people, natural environment and facilities that exist in this world. God created Humans to live in togetherness and complementary: full of love, forgiveness, faith and hope. As social beings, humans also can do social activities like becoming God’s co-worker to look after the world from every damage and problems written above. Social ministry is a ministry to response every problem and its consequence to humans,  environment, and universe.

Consequently, it is simpler to think of deviance as occurring in one of two ways in a social system—the extent to which behaviors are missing that facilitate the achievement of the system goals and the degree to which behavior is present that disrupts or works against the system goals. The anomie-deviance hypothesis is about steady state behavior, the stable rates that occur after people have had a chance to learn what reinforcement contingencies are in effect in a social system. In the short run, people may be inaccurate about reinforcement contingencies. Hamblin, et al. shows that deviant behavior is routinely supported by pathogenic exchanges. A deviant person regularly outwits the other, who inadvertently rewards him or her for behavior to the other.",

      "title": "ARE SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS TERMINABLE?",
      "abstract": "2012 Sedentary behaviors are commonly believed to be interminable. That is, relapse looms over all those involved in physical activity. There is evidence to support this assertion. For example, initial physical activity periods are often followed by relapse episodes or complete withdrawal. Also, very few people are physically active on a regular basis and activity levels appear to decrease with age. Some people do, however, remain physically active for long periods of time - perhaps even indefinitely. What is unique about these people? To answer this question constructs from the Transtheoretical Model (TM) of behavior change were examined. The first construct examined was the \"maintenance\" stage of change. People in maintenance have sustained physical activity involvement for periods lasting at least 6 months. The second construct was the \"transformed\" stage of change. People in this stage have sustained physical activity involvement for 5 or more years and, importantly, are 100% confident this can be continued indefinitely. A third construct, not directly accounted for in TM, may also emerge (i.e., \"long-term maintenance\"). People placed here have sustained physical activity involvement for 5 or more years, but do not believe this can be continued indefinitely. Using these decision rules, 306 people (M age = 40 yr.; 59.9% female; 93.1% Caucasian) were classified as follows: 24.8% maintainers, 52.3% long-term maintainers, and 22.9% transformed. With stage serving as the independent variable, participants were compared on: age, attitude toward role modeling (ATRM), BMI, self-perceived physical activity, self-perceived fitness, and exercise METS. Overall group differences were observed (p<0.01). In follow-up tests, mean scores followed a gradient pattern of improvement from maintenance through transformed. ATRM and self-perceived fitness best described the differences observed between the three groups. In summary, preliminary support is offered to suggest a possible transformed stage of change. On the basis of our findings, it would appear that people reaching this stage have robust cognitive profiles in terms of an underlying construct we have labeled \"self-image.\"",

Third, when losing aim and unity we invent a beyond, a metaphysical world, and find it does not exist, that it was fabricated by the human mind, by our need for meaning, then we lose the sense of truth, we kill God, as Nietzsche's madman cried: 'God is dead and we have killed him ourselves!' (GS: III, 125). One reaches, then, the will to nothing, an aversion to life, a revolt against the fundamental preconditions of life because 'Men prefer to have the will to nothing rather than have no will' (Nietzsche GM: I, 28).",

      "title": "God on Wheels",
      "abstract": "At kiddush one day, I was welcoming a visitor to synagogue when she popped the question. \"What's wrong with you?\" she asked as her eyes flicked from my face to my wheels. I've been asked this question in an astounding array of inappropriate venues; I didn't flinch. \"I have a disability,\" I said, though it was plain she'd already noticed. A firm full stop followed that statement, though I knew full well I didn't answer her question. I'm more than willing to talk about disability, but I'm disinclined to do so while waiting in the buffet line for my salad.In truth, my answer was something of a lie. What's wrong with me has more to do with objectification, pity, and disdain than with honest muscle and bone. The primary problem lies in social attitudes, architectural barriers, and cultural conceptions of normalcy that value certain modes of being over others. In other words, the problem is ableism — a complex set of power relations and structural arrangements that privilege certain bodies or minds as normal while designating others as abnormal and that afford the \"able\" the right to exercise power and influence over those considered disabled.The disability justice movement has drawn many of us together for activism, artistry, and passionate community. In these circles, disability isn't a medical diagnosis, but a cultural movement. Approaching disability through the lens of culture allows us to appreciate disability as a dimension of human diversity. This perspective has often been overlooked in religious communities. But like the critical interpretive insights of feminist, queer, womanist, and liberation theologies, disability culture can bring vital, transformative insight to questions of spirit.I claim disability as a vibrant part of my own identity, as a meaningful way of naming and celebrating the intricate unfolding of my own skin and soul. A student once asked whether it was appropriate for someone with a disability to recite the blessing Asher Yatzar, the blessing that Jews recite to praise the One who creates the body with wisdom. My bones say yes. I bless God for crafting this holy house of skin and blood: these clear eyes and bony hips, this leg a bit shorter than the next, this hip unwilling to bear weight. When I walked as a child, my heel used to strike ground in its own distinctive rhythm. Though my walk was subject to scrutiny and no small disapproval, I remember listening to the off-beat of my quirky stride, loving the sound of my own step.Growing up disabled, growing up queer, the stakes were stark. It was either kindle tenacious love for myself or swallow the world's projections whole. In the luminous words of Ntozake Shange in For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf, \"I found god in myself / and I loved her / I loved her fiercely.\" Muscle, heart, body, and bone testify to the One who made me, to the Source of wind and rain and soil who cobbled my elements into form and breathed soul into my veins. Who had the brilliant audacity to call it good and know it whole.As a feminist, as a queer woman, and as a disabled bi-sexual Jew, I insist on honoring the integrity of a self that has often been disdained. These days, I also find myself increasingly moving through spaces that are opening toward welcome. As growing numbers of religious communities strive to include people with disabilities, they increasingly undo the structural and attitudinal barriers to our engagement. This is vital work, urgently needed. In recent years, such commitments to inclusion have led synagogues to invest in religious education for children with intellectual disabilities, to negotiate community standards around amplification on Shabbat, to provide large-print siddurim (prayer books), to rethink prohibitions that limit the participation of those who are Deaf, to provide barrier- free access to the bimah (the platform used for Torah reading), and to publically affirm welcome for people with disabilities. I value these efforts. I believe they are essential for the vitality and integrity of religious community. But I fear that by conceptualizing disability primarily as an access problem to be solved, we fail to invite in the vibrant, transgressive potential of disability culture: of a \"crip\" sensibility that celebrates disability as a way of life, a radically different way of moving through the world.On the morning of the holiday of Shavuot, Jewish communities around the world chant from the book of Ezekiel, reciting the Israelite prophet's striking image of God. The prophet speaks of a radiant fire borne on a vast chariot, lifted up by four angelic creatures with fused legs, lustrous wings, and great wheels. The wheels, he says, \"gleamed like beryl.\" They were \"wheels within wheels,\" which could move in any direction — \"for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels\" (Ezekiel 1:15- 21). In Jewish tradition, Ezekiel's wild, uncanny vision has been the site of much mystical speculation. In late antiquity, a group of Jewish mystics left impassioned writings about drawing closer and closer to the divine throne. For them, the wheels Ezekiel saw formed God's chariot, the divine seat that bore God's glory through the heavens.While those ancient mystics fascinate my scholarly sensibility, I never found Ezekiel's vision particularly revelatory for my own spirit. But one recent Shavuot, Ezekiel's vision split open my own imagination. Hearing those words chanted, I felt a jolt of recognition, an intimate familiarity. I thought: God has wheels!When I think of God on wheels, I think of the delight I take in my own chair. I sense the holy possibility that my own body knows, the way wheels set me free and open up my spirit. I like to think that God inhabits the particular fusions that mark a body in wheels: the way flesh flows into frame, into tire, into air. This is how the Holy moves through me, in the intricate interplay of muscle and spin, the exhilarating physicality of body and wheel, the rare promise of a wide-open space, the unabashed exhilaration of a dance floor, where wing can finally unfurl.On wheels, I feel the tenor of the path deep in my sinews and sit bones. I come to know the intimate geography of a place: not just broad brushstrokes of terrain, but the minute fluctuations of topography, the way the wheel flows. When I roll, I pay particular attention to the interstices and intersections: the place where concrete seams together uneasily, the buckle of tree roots pushing up against asphalt, the bristle of crumbling brick. I have come to believe this awareness reflects a quality of divine attention. Perhaps the divine presence moves through this world with a bone-deep knowledge of every crack and fissure. Perhaps God is particularly present at junctions and unexpected meetings, alert to points of encounter where two things come together.The suggestion that God may be glimpsed in part through a disabled life flies in the face of the way many of us imagine the divine. Classical theology has often emphasized God's omnipotence and radical independence. To many, a disabled life highlights the weakness, vulnerability, and dependence that characterize the frailty and fragility of human flesh. But vulnerability is a shared human experience, not something particular to disability. Disability culture is marked by a lively spirit of adaptability, creativity, and resilience — not to mention a vibrant sense of delight.Disability invites us to rethink the nature of divine power, to jettison the classical image of God as the one who can upend mountains on a whim. An activist friend with significant muscular atrophy describes the way disability has sharpened her skills in the art of delegating and directing a staff of personal attendants, friends, and occasional passersby to facilitate her way in the world. This too, it seems, is the nature of God's power. I feel the divine presence like a live, wild current running through this world, tuned to and intimately intertwined with flesh and blood and stone. But when God wants something done, brute force simply will not do the job. God cannot pick up a single stone without a human hand to lift it. When God desires direct action in the world of matter, She must inspire and cajole, adapt and orchestrate, trust and yearn. God too, I suspect, finds it occasionally frustrating.Imagining God in and through my wheels puts a different spin on a critical religious issue. If God wheels through the world, then I suspect She often has an access problem. In this world built for striders, armored against flow and spin, how can we let God in? How do we make space for the wild, freewheeling movement of the chariot? Read through the lens of disability, this question becomes central to the political and spiritual task of fashioning liberatory communities. Let us strive to open the inaccessible spaces of our hearts. Let us strive together to break down barriers within ourselves and our communities. Let us refashion the crusted architecture of our minds that keeps the Holy at bay.",

      "abstract": "Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. nonanthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces (1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, (2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and (3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",

Typically, the child charges that he has been born into an unwanted or miserable life. These suits offer the prospect of financial relief for some disabled or neglected children and have some theoretical advantages over alternative causes of action. This chapter begins by the assumption that it is possible that being created can benefit a person in part, or overall, should her life be sufficiently worth living, and that it is also possible that being created can harm a person. Joel Feinberg has argued for precluding liability on the following grounds. Assessing liability for the imposed burdens of this child's life would be like \"holding a rescuer liable for injuries he caused an endangered person.\" The rescuer may have to cause some injuries to save the endangered person.",

      "title": "Discrimination Forms in the Professional Area 1",
      "abstract": "Relevant theoretical background for approaching the discrimination phenomenonDiscrimination (Latin discriminatio - separation) a concept closely related to the one of difference. The original meaning of separation has the significance of a neutral act, even a passive one of establishing a difference - which closely linked to the identification process. Territoriality the one determining individuals to notice the presence of a different being in their proximity and, in the identification process, to adopt an attitude against this being, either aggressive or non-aggressive. Hence, when a group, irrespective of the species, uses elements/signals of identification between its members and ones of differentiation against one or more individuals for adopting a certain delimitation attitude, we deal with discriminatory behaviour, which does not presuppose moral connotation. Thus, identity represents a posture adopted for the duration of an interaction, a possibility of an individual, (or of a group of individuals) to organise relationships against one another (...) From this perspective, the individual not perceived as determined by his belonging because he the one which gives a significance to the latter! (Ogien, 1987, p. 135)In the fifties, under the influence of social movements, the negative connotation developed with respect to the term of discrimination. The initial, neutral meaning, synonymous with the distinction, took over a pejorative connotation. Now, it about differentiation actions either abusively or illegally, by separating a social group and treating another in a disfavouring manner, one way or the other. At the same time, the term of non-discrimination emerges, with the entire associated conceptualisation.There are differences in the social contexts in which individuals practicing discrimination function. In the case of Europe, we might talk about a shared common definition of discrimination, and of its institutionalisation/regulation by laws, actions of repression taken by authorities against discriminatory acts. However, there are outside the democratic states, governments openly legitimising, in the name of morality, religion, or ideology, forms that we call discrimination. Examples therefore are the laws limiting fundamental liberties of women, or that deny the rights of indigenous people; it a type of discrimination depriving de facto individuals from the viewpoint of human rights. As result, defining discrimination related closely to the values of the societies. Some individuals may be discriminated based on the complex of elements constituting their identity, such as the case of an indigenous woman - she can be discriminated as woman, but also as person belonging to the indigenous populations.According to the sociologist Mihailescu loan (1993), discrimination represents difference, restriction, exclusion, preference or differing treatment which disadvantages an individual/group, as compared to others in the same situations, or the use of unequal treatment against a person or against a group of persons in relationship with other categorical features: racial, ethnic or religious belonging, or class attachment. The term is used for describing the action of a dominant majority in relationship with a minority and involves a prejudice caused to an individual or to a (Mihailescu I., in Zamfir and Vlasceanu, 1993, p. 177).The discrimination represents, consequently, the differentiated treatment applied to an individual by its inclusion into a certain social group. Discrimination an individual action, but if the members of the same group are treated similarly, then it represents a social model of collective behaviour (Banton, 1998). In social sciences, the term refers to the differentiated treatment against the large majority, with negative effects on the individual exposed to it.The United Nations Organisation includes in discrimination any conduct based on the distinction operated in relationship with certain natural and social categories and which not related to the individual capacities and merits, or to the actual behaviour of an individual. …",

It appears then that, in common language, instigation carries the negative connotation of influencing somebody to do something bad or inadvisable. And indeed, similarly, the concept of instigation has been applied in the prosecution of international crimes in order to capture the criminal responsibility of those who, even though not carrying out any elements of the crime themselves, have psychologically prompted other people to perpetrate such crimes. In international criminal proceedings, the same idea has also been expressed with concepts like soliciting and inducing, or incitement.",

Of particular importance in large-scale human societies is third-party punishment in which individuals punish a transgressor or norm violator even when they themselves are not affected. Nonhuman primates and other animals aggress against conspecifics with some regularity, but it is unclear whether this is ever aimed at punishing others for noncooperation, and whether third-party punishment occurs at all. Here we report an experimental study in which one of humans' closest living relatives, chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ), could punish an individual who stole food. Dominants retaliated when their own food was stolen, but they did not punish when the food of third-parties was stolen, even when the victim was related to them. Third-party punishment as a means of enforcing cooperation, as humans do, might therefore be a derived trait in the human lineage.",

The Impossibility Result is the inevitable result of the proposed conceptual difference between ‘injustice’ and ‘exploitation’. Injustice occurs when one member of a society deviates from the norms and the legal rules concerning how one should treat other members of that society. Exploitation occurs when one member of a society takes advantage of entities such wild animals, cattle, a field of vegetables, or other people that lie outside the boundary of that society. In many cases of exploitation, the exploited may derive some benefit, as in the case when enslavement is better than death. In other cases of exploitation, the exploited may derive zero benefit, called here ‘harm’, as in the case when a deer is hunted.",

      "title": "Mark My Words",
      "abstract": "Whoever first said, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me” obviously had never heard of marked words. Marked words are those that take on a meaning beyond their definition when something that has no linguistic meaning in or of itself is added. Examples are the suffixes “ette” or “ess” to feminize a noun. Unfortunately, they often do more than that. Deborah Tannen, a linguistics professor, asks how confident you might feel if you were being treated by a “Doctoress” or the scalpel holder was a “Surgeonette.” In a similar manner, the same descriptive word may infer very different things depending upon the sex of the person being described. When applied to a male, “aggressive” infers that he is a real go-getter while an aggressive female (a.k.a. “the bitch”) frequently is viewed as an undesirable employee who will produce only trouble. The very descriptors we choose are also marked words in a sense, since some words like serene, pretty, giddy, perky (remember Ed Asner’s famous remark to Mary Tyler Moore, “I hate perky”) may or may not be intended as put-down terms, but they definitely remind one that the person is feminine. I wondered if this sort of descriptive sexism ever crept into letters of recommendation. I undertook a totally unscientific, nonrandom, retrospective, statistically insignificant study. I looked at the letters of recommendation we had received for 20 women and 20 men applying for a residency in our department of obstetrics and gynecology to determine how male and female faculty chose to describes applicants by looking at the adjectives used in the letters. Writers used 96 different adjectives. The one that appeared most often was “hardworking,” followed closely by “mature,” “bright,” and “enthusiastic.” All these words have much the same implication when applied to either sex and were used equally by faculty of either sex. However, other adjectives were much more interesting. The adjective “aggressive” appeared in only four letters. One woman described a man as aggressive whereas three men used the word, twice describing women, once describing a man. “Attractive,” “charming,” “well-dressed,” and “neat” were used exclusively by male writers to describe female applicants. No men were described using these adjectives, nor was there any reference made to a male’s physical appearance or dress by any writer. In this age of where physician-patient communication is of such concern, “articulate” was only used occasionally, and then only to describe female candidates. My favorite description is that of a female applicant who was described by a male writer as “well articulated.” Perhaps he meant that her jawbone worked well. “Thorough” was exclusively for women whereas “professional” was reserved to describe men. What can we learn from the small sample? Certainly we can draw no vast conclusions, but it does point out that occasionally, and probably unintentionally, our choice of words may hamper rather than help an applicant. Given a single opening and two equally qualified candidates, would you rather have a delightful, charming, attractive, well-groomed resident who might even be well articulated, or one who is professional, astute, organized, and energetic? Next time you sit down to write a letter of recommendation, mark my words, you’ll do your applicants a great favor if you reread it to make sure you haven’t marked yours.",

It is a family of views about well-being which descends from Aristotle, and Darwall has much of interest to say about the good life, and particularly about Aristotle's views on the subject. Many of the observations central to his position seem to me cogent, and are shared by other writers. These include three important propositions: that a good life, one which is good for those whose life it is, is not necessarily the same as a life which they think is good for them, nor does it necessarily consist in their desires being satisfied, nor in the satisfaction of any subset of their desires (e.g. their considered desires, or those not based on any false assumptions). that people aim or intend to do what is worth doing, to have relationships worth having, and engage in goals worth pursuing, and so on, and that all of these, and their combination, are distinct from having a good life (and this explains how people can knowingly sacrifice their own good), and that what makes the well-being of people worth pursuing, to the extent that it is, what provides reasons for those same people and for others to protect or promote it, is that people are valuable in themselves.",

      "abstract": "Some folk tales have the story that “if a woman sympathizes with an object, the woman becomes to have a secret love affair.” Folk tales of such a type have been handed down while showing nationwide distribution. In this study, the folk tale of such a type is named as the folk tale of ‘demoralization’ and a folk tale handed down in Incheon was mainly used to develop a discussion. It is said that a woman becomes to have a secret love affair if sympathizing with the sacredness of a rock for the type of a rock, an artificially-processed object for the type of a tombstone and with a topographical feature for the type of the physical aspect of a mountain, respectively. In these three types of folk tales, the object symbolizes the sexual organs of a man or a woman, which is sympathized with a woman and then makes a woman to have a secret love affair. It is said that if a specific behavior such as shaking, poking or looking at these objects is accompanied, it leads a woman to have a secret love affair. Sometimes village people hold sacred such an object and protect it not to be noticed by other ones or deform or destroy it not to be recognized with its original shape. In the type of a spring, the amour of a woman is regarded to be caused by ‘water.’ As the this type is focused on the reason why a great man has not been cultivated in Kyodong, the amour of a woman is created as a secondary matter. As a group handed down such a folk tale has created not a man but a natural or artificial object as the counterpart of a woman’s immoral conduct, it threw all of the blame on the woman. If the object which encourages the amour of a woman exists, they believe that amour may occur at any time. It means that it did not occurred in the past but may occur now. And it makes people have a negative view of the women living in the area so that these women have various restrictions in social life. It is considered that such a folk tale about ‘demoralization’ is reflected directly with the social aspect of patriarchy as it is.",

      "abstract": "The word dhamma/dharma, whose root “dhr” means “to bind,” “to keep,” or “to maintain,” refers to a rather broad range of entities and relations. In fact, it seems to have the broadest field of semantic reference of any word in Pali (dhamma) or Sanskrit (dharma). On the one hand, dhamma is used to refer to both objects and their parts or elements (i.e., physical objects in the world around us). It also may refer to relations among objects, or more generally to any object of reference in thought or speech – in the same way that “thing” is used in ordinary English. On the other hand, dhamma may be understood to include “social morality” or the “moral law” as that which holds or binds people together. In this sense, dhamma refers to the underlying pattern or order of the cosmos and also to the pattern and order realized in the social and ethical rules and laws of human beings. Understood in this way, dhamma includes the ideas of virtue, duty, or proper moral and ethical conduct. Finally, as a technical term, Dhamma also means the specific teachings of the Buddha. As such, Buddhism is concerned with experiencing, discovering, understanding, practicing, and realizing the Dhamma.",

      "title": "[Support psychotherapy in traumatic situations].",
      "abstract": "It seems that a certain consensus exists to speak about a traumatic situation as an experience which is made up of a threat on the physical or psychological integrity of a person and against which one responds with fear, desperation and intensive horror. Different psychological phenomena are involved with the manner through which a human being confronts his/her past. In particular, the response to traumatic situations, mourning, and blame share their characteristic of being an irreversible living reality related to facts, loss or past impacts and it is necessary to integrate these in one's life in order to advance; these comprise a triangle frequently coexisting and interconnected. Aid for these three situations has, therefore, as common elements, two premises: an active task is required by the person who suffers this situation; this person must, in some form, desire to move ahead. One can not toil in mourning, in a traumatic experience, or in a life of blame if these have a positive symbolic value for this person; for example, mourning as a manner not to treason the dead person by forgetting that person, the reliving a trauma as an attempt to provide some sense to the actions which occurred, or blame as a desire to not forget an error or as a final punishment of this active task; the final objective of this active task is not usually to forget but to integrate in order to live. If a person does not perceive this clearly, this person may not become actively involved in the task to overcome a traumatic situation and to move ahead, nor will that person accept that a person who tries to help questions this person's realities or experiences.",

A person violates another's rights when she acts in a manner that is defective and morally indefensible, given both the risks it generates for the other person and the setbacks it causes to that person's interests either intentionally or negligently. Harming that meets these conditions is morally indefensible, as it lacks an adequate justification or excuse. The consent of the person harmed provides some justification for harming, according to the classical Volenti maxim that “to one who has consented, no wrong is done.” Feinberg goes on to examine the concept of a victim, which he defines as one who suffers any kind of unconsented‐to harm to one's interests. Feinberg concludes by considering the causation of harming.",

      "title": "Ethics Askew: A Case Study Of Ethics In An Educational Environment",
      "abstract": "For a formal definition of ethics, Webster’s New World Dictionary (1995) defines the term as “the study of standards of conduct and moral judgment”. Ethics is important to individuals because we are concerned with what leaders do and who they are—their conduct and character. “Conduct” is a word that implies behavior. Behavior can change under differing circumstances. For instance, in a “low key”, unstressed situation, most individuals tend to be civil and polite; however, the introduction of stress factored into a scenario can totally change the dynamics of the situation, as well as the ability of those involved to “cope”. Stress can cause individuals to become hostile, rebellious, and oftentimes uncompromising. Stress introduced into a situation can also cause individuals to become unethical. For example, take natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 whereby individuals were under tremendous stress of discomfort from not having a clean environment in which to live, as well as conditions of hunger and thirst from lack of food and fresh water. Most of us have witnessed the television footage of the “looting” that occurred from these conditions. Or take the civil unrest that occurred in the streets of Los Angeles after the verdict of 1992 when police officers were acquitted of the beating of an African American named Rodney King. Again, anger and stress caused looting and violence to erupt in the streets. While these are “extreme” situations, the question arises as to how individuals cope with stress in an atmosphere where civility is taught and encouraged. For instance, consider a classroom situation where an assignment to produce an outcome is given with few rules, and the members of the group are from other classes, possibly even in other states. The means of communication for these individuals are e-mail, a relatively new virtual reality website, similar to face book, or telephone should one choose to use that method. This type of situation would most likely exist in a graduate program and in fact, did. This paper is a case study of just that type of situation.",

      "title": "The Safety and Health of Emergency Workers",
      "abstract": "Emergency personnel, like all workers, carry out their duties within an environment composed of a set of discrete elements. First, there is the emergency itself. Whether a forest fire in France, a tornado in the American Midwest, or a mining disaster in Russia, the emergency imposes certain exigencies upon the responders. Second, a social structure exists with specific social units, rules, and forms of association. An emergency response, therefore, takes place within a context of prescribed behaviors, expectations, and value judgments that are sometimes in conflict with each other. Third, there is a technology that must be understood in order to accomplish group goals. If the technology itself is implicated in the emergency, the entire emergency environment may be impacted. Clearly, a breakdown in any of these elements could result in worker injury and might heighten responder stress. This paper discusses how emergency workers not only get injured but may come to experience burn‐out, post‐traumatic stress syndrome, or impaired work and family relationships, even though their normal work setting (the emergency) is expected to be ‘abnormal’. The authors suggest areas in each of the three environmental elements that deserve further inquiry.",

Regarding the number of occurrences of teeth in the Bible there are 36 cases in the Old Testament and 11 in the New Testament. Out of this number 39 are about human teeth and 8 about those of the animals. The paper starts with the consideration of the talio-law (Lev 24.20: \"If he knocks out a tooth, one of his teeth shall be knocked out\"), which is regarded to be originated in the Babilonian King Hammurabi's compendium (B.C. 19th century), which was asserted by the king to have been delivered to him by Marduk. Comparing the habit of gnashing, grinding, or gritting of teeth, or showing the white of one's teeth, the author points out that whereas the first is a passive concomitant of pain (either mental--in which case it is called bruxomania, or otherwise: based on physical reasons) the second type is a phenomenon of an imminent action (i.e. threat or attack). Periodontics (or parodontology that is to say the branch that deals with diseases of the supporting and investing structures of the teeth including the gums, the cementum peridontal membranes and alveolar bone), regards the grinding of the teeth to be a parafunction ...",

Anyone who believes that Wittgenstein's remarks here embody important truths has quite a bit of explaining to do. What needs to be explained is why it is that enormous numbers of people, people who have never had the chance to be corrupted by reading Descartes or Dennett, are willing, with only the slightest prompting, to speak in ways which appear to conflict dramatically with Wittgenstein's thought. Many people appear to find no difficulty at all in the idea that we could ascribe thoughts, sensations, emotions and so on to things which in no way resemble or behave like a living human being—for example to disembodied ‘minds’ or ‘souls’ or disembodied brains floating in tanks. And with a little more pressing many will agree that it is never to the living human being that these states are, strictly speaking, correctly ascribed; but, rather, to one part of the living human being—the brain, for example. Now if this incredibly widespread tendency is the expression of confusion then we need an explanation of its existence. We need this partly because without it it will be difficult to undermine the tendency; and partly because we might expect that such a widespread tendency is a distortion of some truth.",

According to Selye’s GAS, there are generally three stages in the human body’s reaction to extreme stress. First, the alarm reaction, in which the body stirs up its defense mechanisms—the glands, hormones, and nervous system—into action; second, the adaptation stage, when the body fights back (e.g., the arteries can harden when the heart is under pressure); and third, the exhaustion stage, when the body’s defenses seem to be unable to cope, and the individual becomes seriously ill and may dieSelye concludes that the best way to survive and thrive is to adapt and respond in positive ways to the stress of life.",

Causes and occasions are of the most various types, difficult to compare between persons, often moulded by the currents of the day, inherited ways of thinking, experiences and environment. Querulants are personalities, who, after colliding with the legal system and having had their own claims dismissed, suffer from an often chief and irremediable feeling of being victim of an injustice. They cannot understand that, what is in due form valid can, when, scrutinized with the greatest sense of justice and practical common sense, impress upon someone as injustice. The submission to the unattainable, the parting from hopes, expectations and claims do not materialize. The step by step stiffening readiness for action can be confined to the lawsuit matter, it comes however about, that it extends to further spheres of life. Escalations occur in particular then, when the authorities course of action, courts of justice and opponents are felt as tyrants or mortal threat. A person deriving a meaning from his entire life or events, which he interprets for himself, makes his relations to the community and Law fragile [90]. Are presented within the framework of differential diagnostic distinctions, manifestations of querulous behaviour among abnormal personalities, neurotic disorders and schizophrenic psychoses under psychiatric aspects. Brought into sharper focus are the psychogenic psychoses, which became manifest in the USA, GUS and scandinavian countries in connection with serious querulous evolutions.

This alienation establishes compulsive behaviors that deprive the subject of free will. Management taken literally leads to the temptation of excess and the passionate amplification of problems. The “bad habits” of a manager reverberate. Psychoanalysis as a practice or knowledge can act here as an antidote by bringing a fair measure of passion. The activity of reflection builds symbolic landmarks between which the metaphorical narrative myth about making and leading others can be organized. The conduct of men is not only organizational and methodological: it is spiritual. Self-knowledge that avoids recourse to defensive or aggressive mechanisms allows us to develop emotional accommodations, connecting practice and ethics without confusing them in “justastructure” (Seve 1966). We must all suspect ourselves and each other of hidden temptations disguised with legitimate reasons. Ethics is the unconditional authorization to become “someone else” in a space where knowledge, skill, initiative, and respect for shared values mean that freedom and limits must constantly be defined. But let no one be fooled: the best is confiscated by the discrete, efficient, and united castes who firmly hold the titles and means. Management serves them. Unconditionally.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> The after-contraction is an old parlor trick of children which has been described many times as having interesting physiological and psychiatric implications. Although it is a difficult phenomenon to describe, it is easy enough to demonstrate. It is usually performed by abducting the stiffened arm against an immovable object, such as a table or wall. The appropriate muscles of the shoulders are contracted isometrically without movement; the subject is then requested to relax and to step away from the restraining object. In most cases the arm will then involuntarily “float up” into the air toward the horizontal position with a floating sensation. This involuntary movement, which is a continuation of the originally intended movement, usually persists for 10 to 15 seconds. It may be demonstrated in almost any muscle group of the body, including the muscles of the hand, leg, or eye. It is ap",

      "title": "An Attempt To Defend Theism",
      "abstract": "The fact of evil has worried theists for a long time. The earliest clear statement of this worry is perhaps to be found in the book of Habbakuk: ‘Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?’ (i, 13). More precisely formulated, it comes to this: if God is good and omnipotent, why evil ? From his goodness it would follow necessarily that he does not will evil and from his omnipotence that he could prevent it; why then should it occur? Theists have attempted to escape from this dilemma by means of an argument which turns on the claim that human beings are, to some degree at any rate, free to choose and act as they will. They are free to do good or evil; frequently they choose the latter and that is why evils, or at least many of them, occur. This human freedom, however, is a necessary condition of personality and, as such, a great good; so it is perfectly consistent with the goodness of God that he should will it. But what of his omnipotence? The point of the argument is that God has to allow those evils which result from men making evil choices, and this certainlylooks, at first blush, like a limitation of his power. But, we are assured,it is not really a limitation because all it amounts to is that God cannot do the logically impossible, viz. , make beings who, at one and the same time, are both free to do what they will and pre-determined to do good.To deny that God can do the logically impossible, of course, is not to den his omnipotence; it is merely to point out that there are some things which it would not make sense to say that he had done.",

In (1), for example, being drunk and kissing someone are typically interpreted as temporary properties or events which take place in a particular place at a particular time: John was drunk last night in his office, or he kissed Mary on Sunday 13th of May, 2001, at 2:13pm, for exactly 8,56 seconds. Contrastingly, in (2), if one is intelligent or in love, one tends to retain these properties for a relatively long period of time. Although one’s mental capacities may change due to accidents and illnesses and although one may well fall out of love, this does not change the fact that these properties are potentially stable and long-lasting:",

      "abstract": "The feeding of animals on bodies after death - so-called post-mortem animal predation - may complicate autopsy interpretations when there has been removal of significant amounts of skin and tissues. An extreme situation which sometimes arises is the complete evisceration and/or consumption of all major cavity organs. Search of autopsy files at Forensic Science South Australia was undertaken for examples of this phenomenon. Although such a finding at autopsy may suggest the actions of larger animals such as dogs or sharks, it may also occur when groups of smaller animals, such as cats, act in concert. Complete loss of organs may also occur if significant insect activity accompanies decomposition. Empty body cavities may therefore result from of a wide variety of animal activities involving a range of species in quite different environments. A significant problem once organs have been removed or consumed is in identifying or excluding natural diseases or injuries that may have played a role in the lethal episode.",

Particularly interesting is the manner in which the body protects itself against injurious foreign substances. The epithelial lined body cavities have more or less specialized methods of protection. The stomach, for instance, by vomiting emits food that is spoiled, and many drugs that are irritating or disagreeable to the taste, and sometimes even rejects substances that are thought to be nauseating or noxious even though they are not. The excessive salivation when nausea occurs probably tends to dilute the offensive material, or to protect the walls of the mucous membrane.

There are situations, when it is morally right, and indeed obligatory, to allow a dying person to die in peace and dignity. But there is a world of difference between allowing a peaceful death, and deliberately setting out to bring death of the person either by acts of commission (s.c. 'active euthanasia'), or by acts of omission (s.c. 'passive euthanasia'). The word \"killing\" seems proper for euthanasia, because \"to kill\" does mean \" to intentionally cause the death of someone.\" It can be morally acceptable to withhold or withdraw a treatment precisely because it is reasonably judged as inefficacious (futile), or excessively burdensome for the patient. One's reason for withholding such treatment must not be a judgement about the desirability of putting an end to the patient's life, but a judgement about the desirability of putting an end to the treatment, which is futile or burdensome.",

      "title": "Humans Can Visually Judge Grasp Quality and Refine Their Judgments Through Visual and Haptic Feedback",
      "abstract": "How humans visually select where to grasp objects is determined by the physical object properties (e.g., size, shape, weight), the degrees of freedom of the arm and hand, as well as the task to be performed. We recently demonstrated that human grasps are near-optimal with respect to a weighted combination of different cost functions that make grasps uncomfortable, unstable, or impossible, e.g., due to unnatural grasp apertures or large torques. Here, we ask whether humans can consciously access these rules. We test if humans can explicitly judge grasp quality derived from rules regarding grasp size, orientation, torque, and visibility. More specifically, we test if grasp quality can be inferred (i) by using visual cues and motor imagery alone, (ii) from watching grasps executed by others, and (iii) through performing grasps, i.e., receiving visual, proprioceptive and haptic feedback. Stimuli were novel objects made of 10 cubes of brass and wood (side length 2.5 cm) in various configurations. On each object, one near-optimal and one sub-optimal grasp were selected based on one cost function (e.g., torque), while the other constraints (grasp size, orientation, and visibility) were kept approximately constant or counterbalanced. Participants were visually cued to the location of the selected grasps on each object and verbally reported which of the two grasps was best. Across three experiments, participants were required to either (i) passively view the static objects and imagine executing the two competing grasps, (ii) passively view videos of other participants grasping the objects, or (iii) actively grasp the objects themselves. Our results show that, for a majority of tested objects, participants could already judge grasp optimality from simply viewing the objects and imagining to grasp them, but were significantly better in the video and grasping session. These findings suggest that humans can determine grasp quality even without performing the grasp—perhaps through motor imagery—and can further refine their understanding of how to correctly grasp an object through sensorimotor feedback but also by passively viewing others grasp objects.",

Esa identidad se puede facilmente manipular: cada cual puede ponerse un vestido, quitarlo, tenirlo, coserlo, descoserlo etc. Bajo la pluma de Cervantes, en particular, el vestido viene asi a ser un instrumento significativo de transformacion o recreacion de la realidad. En “Rinconete y Cortadillo”, el conjunto de las prendas que aparecen tienen una caracteristica significativa: son prendas maltratadas, descosidas, rotas o de mal aspecto. Y eso porque los que las llevan son seres marginados, sea de modo voluntario o no. Y lo descosido no se limita a la ropa: todo el universo en el que se mueven los personajes parece haber sido tambien deteriorado, como lo revela significativamente del idioma ahi empleado. En ese universo, Rincon y Cortado cortan, rompen, despedazan o saquean los vestidos, o sea lo que constituye la apariencia de cada cual, su armadura social, la identidad que propone a los demas. Saquean los trajes para ir a buscar las faldriqueras que se esconden bajo los vestidos/apariencias, parte mas intima de esa identidad. Tal vez hagan ellos lo que Cervantes hace con su pluma: ir a buscar lo que se esconde bajo las apariencias, escarbar bajo la superficie que nos ofrece la realidad. Ellos evolucionan en un universo descosido, roto, del cual han adoptado los codigos y que se afanan en romper mas aun. Pero ese mismo universo, al final, al cabo de algunos meses, segun dice el texto, lo abandonan.

Whenever the author tried to ascertain what a person thought or felt about a particular event, or another person, villagers would typically respond by declaring, \"I am not inside them\" (n'de sa bu ro), or \"I do not know what is inside\" (n'de ma konto lon), thereby reminding us that what matters is how a person behaves in relation to others, irrespective of what is in his heart or on his mind. As for intelligence, this was not defined by the esoteric knowledge you possessed any more than wealth was defined by the money you had in the bank or the amount of rice in your granary. Rather, it was expressed in the adroitness with which you engaged with others – the way you greeted or cooperated with them, the way you performed your duties and met your obligations. This ethos extended to emotionality. Unless one's personal feelings had some social value, they should not be publicly expressed.",

      "title": "The power of stigma.",
      "abstract": "Stigma is a very powerful mechanism. It is the expression of an old coping strategy sometimes very efficient for survival. It serves to identify, and to do it forever, a danger. In order to do so, a characteristic of the danger becomes a distinctive mark, or the bearer is marked, often forcefully.\r\n\r\nStigma is the consequence of prejudice and prejudice is detriment or damage, caused to a person by judgement or action in which his/her rights and dignity are disregarded. Prejudice leads to action, and this action is to stigmatise.\r\n\r\nStigma is a brand. To brand is to mark indelibly as a sign of quality. To brand is also to impress indelibly on one's memory, therefore the stigma is both in the stigmatised person and in the stigmatising one.\r\n\r\nStigma comes from the Greek word στγμα, 'mark', which is related to the word στζeιυ, i.e., to tattoo, to prick, to puncture. In Latin it became instigare, 'to urge'; therefore, stigma also leads to action, and this action is discrimination against the stigmatised person. To discriminate is to make adverse distinctions with regards to those stigmatised, and to make distinctions prejudicial to people different from oneself (in race, colour, or sanity). Here the vicious circle is closed, because discrimination leads to prejudice, prejudice to stigma and stigma to discrimination.\r\n\r\nAnimals too stigmatise. Especially those living in woods mark their territory with signals on trees. Birds too mark their territory with their singing, but the closest to human beings is the cat. Allow me an anecdote. Nisse da Silveira, a Brazilian psychiatrist, devoted her life to the study of the artistic production of mentally ill patients, mainly those with chronic schizophrenia. She worked in the Rio de Janeiro Mental Hospital, which at her time was crowded with cats. She was very fond of them and one day she compared them to me with her patients. Cats rub themselves against human beings, leaving in them the odor of glands they have along their neck. The odor depends on which part of the neck they use to rub, and there are odors for friends and others for enemies. Once a cat has identified a person as a friend or enemy, the odor embedded on him or her marks this person forever. The same happens with patients with schizophrenia. Nisse told that if someone is recognised as a threat and forms part of the delusions of a patient, he or she will remain so forever. The opposite is true also.\r\n\r\nThis anecdote reveals two important things. First, the mark is embedded on the subject, and from then on it stays there. The 'marker', the stigmatising person, loses the control of the situation, which from then on is imposed on him. Efforts to remove the mark will lead to make it more prominent and to acquire other negative elements.\r\n\r\nThe second point is that the response to stigma is stigma; stigma is given back as stigma. Cats, and patients with schizophrenia, stigmatise people and are, specially patients, stigmatised themselves. This fact is so prominent and relevant that once I thought of writing a paper entitled Schizophrenia or stigmophrenia. The behavior of stigmatising normal persons towards patients with schizophrenia is the same that patients have towards their delusions. In both cases it consists of something which is experienced as imposed, self-evident, full in certainty, irrefutable to a logical line of argument, as in the old definition of delusion.\r\n\r\nThis is not new. In the late 1960s, Siegle and Osmond (1) described the models of madness, that is, the basic approaches to conceptualise madness. They described seven of them: medical, psychoanalytic, moral, familiar, social, psychedelic and conspirational. Then, the anthropologist Hsu (2) commented that curiously enough, those same models shape the delusions of patients. The consequence is that, when confronted with madness, the one which may afflict oneself or the one perceived in others, the answers are the same.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish psychiatrist Sarro (3) devoted his life to study the contents of delusions. He came to the conclusion that delusions are built with the same elements as myths. In total there are 24 themes of delusions and of myths (mitologemas in Sarro's words), and all of them are an explanation to the basic facts of life: birth, death, transitions, gender, and so on. The confrontation with madness is terrible indeed. Madness is conceived as the loss of one's own mind, and this is the source of great anxiety. Fear of dying and the fear of losing the mind are the two basic forms of anxiety (4), because they are the expression of the fear of ceasing to exist, physically or mentally. Anxiety sets up coping mechanisms, not all of them adaptive. The psychologist Kunz (5), many years ago, tried to find a normal mental phenomenon which had the structure of delusions. He found one, the idea of death. Unable to experience death without dying and full of fear of the unavoidable fact, human beings tend to externalise it, to objectify it, to deny it, the same mechanisms which are present in delusions.\r\n\r\nPsychiatry has done a great effort to delineate normal from abnormal mental events, following the path of the rest of medical disciplines. At the end, psychiatry has been able to identify the symptoms of madness, something essential in order to reach a diagnosis and to take decisions on the best therapeutic options. But this should not lead to abandon another, essential, perspective, which is to delve into the meaning of psychiatric disturbances and to look for common structures with normal mental phenomena. This is a way to understand underlying adaptive mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing notion that delusions have a structure different from normal thinking was recently challenged. For instance, Hillman (6) and Blankenburg (7), among others, have reached the conclusion that this is not the case. If the difference does not lie in the structure of the delusions, if both patients with delusions and the rest of us use the same procedures to grasp reality, to build the world in which we live and to endow it with meanings, stigma becomes an essential aspect of mental diseases. Therefore, the fight against stigma becomes an essential part of the fight against mental diseases. It is not just the need to overcome barriers for care, it is essential to recover mental health. In other words, the barriers that sane, including psychiatrists, build to protect themselves against insanity are barriers that the insane has to overcome to recover his or her sanity.",

      "abstract": "Virtuous violence theory proposes that the perpetrator intends to harm or kill in order to constitute a social relationship to make it correspond with a prescriptive model of what the relationship ought to be – what it must be made to be. For our purposes, a social relationship consists of complementarity between the actions of the participants: each participant’s actions fit previous actions by the other and presuppose “fitting” actions by the other(s), such that the actions of each are incomplete without the congruent action by the other(s). That is, the acts of each are part of a whole that none of them can bring off alone. We encompass in the terms “act” and “actions” not simply the morphology of movements, but also, crucially, the participant’s intentions, moral judgments, and motives (often consciously experienced as emotions). Furthermore, each participant implicitly or explicitly aims to induce completion of her acts: she intends to motivationally evoke and morally invoke the congruent actions that will complete or dynamically sustain the jointly constructed pattern. That is, a participant expects the other(s) to do their part, in the predictive sense, in the hopeful sense, and in the evaluative sense of judging the others’ actions according to how well they complete the intended gestalt. A football game is only football if the opposing players hit each other as hard as they can; the offense can only play offense, blocking and knocking down defenders, against a tackling defense.",

How people arrange their bodies and how they orient them and place them in relation to each other or to features in the environment, provides important information about how they are engaged with one another and about the nature of their intentions and attitudes. Activities in which objects in the environment are being manipulated, modified or rearranged, are indispensable for grasping a person's aims and goals and interests.

Here we find those configurations of action in the face and body that appear as displays of feeling and emotion, as well as actions that often play a central role in the accomplishment of important moments in social interaction.

      "title": "Visual perception of surprising materials in dynamic scenes",
      "abstract": "Many objects that we encounter have material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft and jelly dessert is wobbly. Over a life time of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object9s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes pulled towards the native motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in reaction time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance. Understanding how high-level expectations are integrated with incoming sensory evidence is an essential step towards understanding how the human visual system accomplishes material perception.",

      "title": "Of Things Face-to-Face with Levinas Face-to-Face with Heidegger",
      "abstract": "Things are everywhere. They fill the world with their presence. Whereas it is possible to avoid the Other (person), to reject the encounter, to be solipsistic without condescension; to exempt oneself from an encounter-any encounter-with things is to die. Sensibility, having a body, is to be exposed to things. The body is the exposure. Yet, there are no things for Levinas. He encounters them within the economy of the Same, within a movement (of labor, of enjoyment) that takes its bearings from the Same and returns to the Same. Or he encounters them as gifts (TI 77), as the offer that the Same makes to the Other to welcome her/him, to cover her/his nakedness, and to enact the ethical relationship. It is the Other, however, who constitutes the principle of the donation, not the things themselves.2 In other words, things are for the Same, or for the Other, but not for themselves. That is, for Levinas there is no Otherness of things.3 Conversely, there are things in Heidegger. For him, things are the place where the gathering of the Fourfold-the mortals, the gods, the earth, the sky-comes to pass.4 But the intimacy of things and Fourfold is not fusion, it is dif-fering. Each thing remains other in hosting the Fourfold in its peculiar way: other than the Fourfold and other than any other thing; other than the mortals, who can dwell by things in their thinging only if they can take care of things as things, if they can let them be in their otherness. The purpose of this essay is to lay the theoretical foundations for an approach to things that does not ignore their Otherness. According to Heidegger, the enactment of this respectful relation encrypts the path human beings must follow to be faithful to their destination as mortals. Sharing Heidegger's conviction, this essay claims that in face of their relation with things, human beings determine the authenticity of their mortality, that is, of their being human. According to Levinas's suggestion, the place-which is not a place-where a relation with the Other can be achieved is ethics. Undoubtedly there is ethics in Levinas, even if his notion of ethics extends only to the other person (certainly the other man, hopefully, also the other woman and child).5 Conversely, there is no ethics in Heidegger, at least according to the most common reading. If the two thinkers are forced faceto-face in a confrontation that neither of them would advocate enthusiastically, the result is a chiasmatic structure,6 whose branches connect a double negation-non-ethics and nonthings-and a double affirmation-ethics and things. Since Socrates, philosophy has walked the path of negation. If there is ethics, it is not of things; and if there are things, they are not ethical. The path of affirmation is a narrow strip, which has seldom been explored.7 It leads to an ethics of things, where ethics cannot be traditional ethics in any of its formulations (utilitarian, deontological, virtue-oriented), and things cannot be traditional things (objects opposed to a subject). At the intersection between ethics and things, Levinas and Heidegger meet. The former offers the notion of a non-traditional ethics, the latter of non-traditional things. Some remarks are in order with respect to the modality of the meeting. Despite the common rootedness in Husserl's phenomenology, their encounter is not that of two Aristotelian friends; nor is the one the forerunner of the other; nor is the one in absolute opposition to the other. Levinas and Heidegger do not complement each other, either existentially or historically or philosophically (opposition being only the counterpart to complementation). They stand on their own as two separate, autonomous philosophical figures, one of whom, for chronological reasons, can exercise a sharp criticism of the other, which would be reciprocated, if chronology were to allow it. Their relation, escaping friendship, enmity, complementarity, is better characterized by the Derridian notion of supplement. …",

The English word “morality”—in the limited sense of pertaining to behavior as good (right, correct, worthy, virtuous) versus bad (wrong, incorrect, unworthy, vicious)—expresses a universal concept or distinction shared perhaps by all languages, whether modern or ancient. Long before the earliest written use of concepts like “morality” and “humanity” in religious and administrative contexts, oral cultures stretching far back into prehistory distinguished between good and bad action. For many dozens of millennia, groups of Homo sapiens understood themselves as connected to but also differing from other types of beings: other groups of people, ancestors, spirits and divinities, animals and plants, mountains and bodies of water, etc. Morality—doing things well or badly, correctly or incorrectly, generously or selfishly, appropriately or inappropriately—was perceived anthropomorphically, as extending to many types of entities (e.g., a tale about an animal or divinity acting badly).",

      "abstract": "<strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> In the context of natural hazard risk quantification and modeling of hazard interactions, some &nbsp;literature separates &ldquo;Level I&rdquo; (or occurrence) interactions from &ldquo;Level II&rdquo; (or consequence) interactions. The Level I interactions occur inherently due to the nature of the hazards, independently of the presence of physical assets. In such cases, one hazard event triggers or modifies the occurrence of another (e.g., heavy rain and flooding; liquefaction and landslides triggered by an earthquake), thus creating a dependency between the features characterizing such hazard events. They differ from Level II interactions, which instead occur through impacts/consequences on physical assets/components and systems (e.g., accumulation of physical damage or social impacts due to earthquake sequences, landslides due to the earthquake-induced collapse of a retaining structure). Multi-hazard Life Cycle Consequence (LCCon) analysis aims to quantify the consequences (e.g., repair costs, downtime, casualty rates) throughout a system&rsquo;s service life and should account for both Level I and II interactions. The available literature generally considers Level I interactions &ndash; the focus of this study &ndash; mainly defining relevant taxonomies, often qualitatively, without providing a computational framework to simulate a sequence of hazard events incorporating the identified interrelations among them. This paper addresses this gap, proposing modeling approaches associated with different types of Level I interactions. It describes a simulation-based method for generating multi-hazard event sets (i.e., a sequence of hazard events and associated features throughout the system&rsquo;s life cycle) based on the theory of competing Poisson processes. The proposed approach incorporates the different types of interactions in a sequential Monte Carlo sampling method. The method outputs multi-hazard event sets that can be integrated into LCCon frameworks to quantify interacting hazard consequences. An application incorporating several hazard interactions is presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed method.",

      "title": "The Well of Fortitude",
      "abstract": "Abstract : Well of Fortitude (WoF), introduced by Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman in his book On Killing: Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, is the spark of a greater concept that needs to be taken further. WoF serves as the metaphor for self-development and the development of subordinates. Grossman articulates, stamina on the battlefield [is] a finite resource... [under stress] each man draws steadily from his own private reservoir of inner strength and fortitude until finally the well runs dry. Missing in Grossman's concept is what makes up the private reservoir of inner strength and fortitude of an individual. Taking this metaphor further, consider the WoF to consist of an individual's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual deepness or capacity. Stress of any kind pulls from one or more of these capacities, and when one capacity is drained the others are affected. What is worse, when one capacity runs dry the individual will break, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. This concept applies not only to combat, but to all aspects of life: in school, in training, on a forced march, or in dealing with one's spouse and family. Just as a gem has many facets, a whole-person has multiple facets. Dr. Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness, developed the model of the four intelligences. These are physical intelligence, mental intelligence, emotional intelligence, and spiritual intelligence. four intelligences serve as dimensions of the WoF. Leaders should aim to incorporate the deepening of these intelligences within every training evolution.",

      "title": "HOW TO SEEM VIRTUOUS WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING SO",
      "abstract": "Let me begin by contrasting what I shall call the commonplace rhetorical usage of the virtue-words - 'commonplace', that is, in the contemporary public metropolitan cultures of the so-called advanced societies, such as our own - with the kind of meaning the virtue-words must be understood to have, if they are used to give expression to any tolerably systematic and coherent understanding of the virtues. Both those who judge some particular person to be courageous or generous or just or whatever (using those words in accordance with commonplace usage) and those who apparently judge similarly (using those very same words, but doing so in order to give expression to their own particular systematic and coherent understanding of the virtues) will of course do so on the basis of some set of actions by that person. And it may well be the case, indeed it often enough is the case, that it is on the basis of the very same set of actions, performed in some limited set of situations, that both parties judge that particular person courageous or generous or just. Because he or she on a limited, but sufficiently numerous, range of occasions has done particular brave or generous or just actions and has not performed any clearly cowardly or niggardly or unjust actions, a settled disposition so to act is ascribed. But what it is crucial to notice is that although both parties are ascribing a disposition, using the same words to do so, it is not the same disposition that is being ascribed. The same sentences are being employed, but the judgements to which they give expression are in fact different. Wherein does the difference lie?",

      "title": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGH AND LOW ADJUSTMENT LEVEL STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "Human situation is a constant one. New conditions and problems are constantly setting the individual right from his infancy to his deathbed, and he is invariably engaged in trying to find a satisfactory and pleasurable solution to them by employing his intelligence and other gifts of the mind and body. In other words, life is the name of unceasing process, the process of adjustment. “Adjustment is the process by which a living organism maintains a balance between its needs and the circumstances that influence the satisfaction of these needs” accordingly, the process of adjustment has two primary or main elements: one, the needs of the living organism; and two the conditions of circumstances influencing these needs. These needs can be biogenic, Originating in the society, personal or community, or arising from any other conceivable source. On the other hand, circumstances influencing these needs also can be either inside individual or outside him. Factors within the individuals that influence these needs are his physical and mental states, capacity, attitudes interests, etc. Three Elements in Adjustment An analysis of the process of adjustment of the processes of adjustment will reveal the presence of three main elements: - Motive: The very process of adjustment in the living being is set in motion by the presence within him of some motive or need or requirement. - Thwarting Condition: When the environment does not present any features that tend to become obstacles in the fulfillment of these needs, then the adjustment in natural, facile and effortless, and does not problem in result. However, if circumstances create obstacle in the path of such fulfillment, then the process of adjustment progresses further. -  Varied Responses :  Once the fulfillment of a need has obstructed, individual indulges in various actions, which are a reaction to the obstacle. Such a reaction can be normal just as much as it can be abnormal. -  Solution: Because of these reactions and responses, the individual achieves a degree of adjustment with the circumstances. The problem of adjustment in there by solved. - Motive and adjustment :  Generally speaking, the process of adjustment can be set in motion by any motive.  For example, our physical needs are constantly being manifesting in the form of adjective behavior patterns. However, from our point of view, these needs do not have much importance, for life, itself ceases in the organism, thus obviating all further adjustment activity. Need of study : - present time all people are salves of their problem in presently situations and his determinative life goals. Present time all people have set their life goals to earn a lot of money. In Past time all human being decided his life goal “mocha”. The persons do efforts to gain a lot of money in any situation or from any work .All situation have balanced human behaviors; this work’s main factor is adjustment level. Based on previous research finding conclusion the well adjustable persons have conducted their work very smoothly, and all decisions taken were correct.  From This concepts question arises. What does high adjustment level students achieved on high academic achievement?   Adjustment works normally in every circumstance of human life. Similarly, adjustments on learning achievement would work normally, considering how logical this fact is this study has done. Statement of the problem : - “A comparative study of academic achievement of high and low adjustment level students”",

The association also established the following aims: To upgrade publishing standards of health journals and books, paper-based or electronic; To develop an aggregated indexing system for health articles published in the Asia Pacific Region; and To enhance optimal access to health articles. The development of the Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRIM) and the Global Health Library (GHL) are much-needed efforts to ensure the dissemination of and universal access to reliable health information essential to health development. These efforts will level the playing field for authors, editors, peer reviewers, publishers and subscribers in developing countries, elevating loco-regional research and publishing to the global arena. Following our continued compliance with established standards, we anticipate inclusion of the Philipp J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg in the WPRIM. Through its President Gil M.

      "title": "Learning for safety in health care and air traffic control",
      "abstract": "Introduction\n\nRisk management in enterprises, organisations and companies has had a long and complicated history. \nDuring the eighties, and at least during the beginning of the nineties, the notion concerning risk management was that if an accident happened in an otherwise perfect system it was due to the human operator in some way being the cause of the error. The cause for the accidents was described in terms of “negligence”, “lack of competence” and such similar statements.\n\nGradually, during the late nineties, the risk management paradigm shifted. \nJames Reason, a psychologist, made a tremendous impact with his book Human error, published in 1990.\nHe introduced the term latent failures (or latent conditions). These, he said, are “resident pathogens”, built into the system. They are latent since the system can live with these pathogens for months and even years, and perform adequately, until something happens, which hampers the “immune system of the system”.\nReason states that the human operator goes to work everyday with the intention of doing a good job. The human operator has no wish “to screw up things”. When accidents happen, and operators make mistakes, it is therefore not a deliberate action. The causes should be sought in design flaws in the system. \n\nIn this thesis we are dealing with high-risk systems, though not high-risk technologies. We are studying acute somatic health care, air traffic control, pharmacy and cancer treatment. We will explore different ways for an organisation to receive feedback from safety related occurrences, in order to improve safety.\n\nThe aim with this thesis will be to explore methods for obtaining safety feedback in the above mentioned domains. \nFour different approaches will be attempted:\n\n•\tRetrospective learning from accidents (paper I)\n•\tProactive learning using an external agent (paper II)\n•\tOperator centred learning (paper III)\n•\tUser centred proactive learning (paper IV) \n\nMethods and material\n\nMethods\n\nIn paper I we used MTO (Man-Technique-Organisation) analysis as described by the nuclear power operators in Sweden, with a certain adaptation for health care. \n\nPaper II was inspired on the work with paper I. During the numerous interviews with doctors and nurses a quite common reaction was: “Why did we not think of these risks before? It is so obvious!”\nAnother concern was the limited value of retrospective investigations when it comes to improving safety. \nThis started us on designing a method for proactive risk analysis. Several methods were already described for this, but they were mainly tuned to technical systems with more or less tight coupling, assuming a high degree of linearity (as for instance the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis, FMEA). We felt these methods did not fit the way in which our studied organisations functioned. The result was the DEB (Disturbance- Effect-Barrier) analysis used in paper II. The identified system weaknesses by using this method was compared to system weaknesses extracted from the analysis (done by headquarter analysts) of 15 loss of separation incidents at the unit.\n\nWhen working with this it became obvious that one category of incidents, i.e. the loss of separation incidents (AIRPROX) , was only the tip of the iceberg. Each day there were a number of near misses that did not result in loss of separation, and therefore not used for safety feedback. Talking to the controllers also revealed a hidden knowledge on questionable procedures that might constitute risks. Thus the idea was fairly simple: Why not let the controllers do the job of analysing safety occurrences? This led to the design of a method for operator-centred learning, i.e. paper III. The method included a brief to the controllers for 1½ days on system thinking.\n\nThe starting point for paper IV was particularly tragic. I investigated a case where an eight-year-old girl with cancer was killed by mistake. She was administered the total dose of cytotoxic agents each day for three days, i.e. a 300% overdose. We used the DEB analysis again, for a proactive risk analysis of the process of treating patients with cytotoxic drugs, but this time using a formalised user group. \n\nMaterial\nThe material for paper I was a consecutive series of eight reports to the National Board of Health and Welfare, from acute somatic health care.\n\nThe material for paper II was a DEB analysis performed for the processes at the Malmoe air traffic control unit in Sweden.\n\nIn paper III a trial was performed for half a year with extended reporting of learning occurrences. In this way an additional 45 occurrences were reported which otherwise would not have been documented and analysed.\n\nIn paper IV the DEB analysis were performed at one ward unit at the department of oncology at the Lund University hospital, taking into consideration interface problems between the ward unit and the hospital pharmacy (which prepared the cytotoxic infusions).\n\nResults\nIn paper I we could demonstrate that the notion of latent conditions was fruitful for analysing and learning from medical accidents. We identified a number of system weaknesses in seven out of eight cases, providing a good potential for improving safety.\n\nIn paper II we identified a number of risks (latent conditions) in the air traffic control system. We compared the identified system weaknesses with 15 loss of separation cases, investigated by the regulator. We identified all system weaknesses from 14 out of 15 as loss of separation analyses. \nIn paper III we could demonstrate that the operators indeed were able to analyse “learning occurrences”, and to identify preventive actions, one of these being training on the aircraft flight management system for controllers. Also, they could show that quite a few number of “unexpected flight behaviours” actually were actually partly caused by air traffic control actions.\n\nIn paper IV we refined the DEB analysis by using a formalised reference group of staff from the very beginning.. The analysis disclosed a number of system weaknesses, which were presented for the staff. The disclosed risks were accepted as valid, and quite a few of our recommendations were implemented during the next couple of years\n\nDiscussion\nWe discuss our methods in relation to current research, particularly we discuss MTO analysis in relation to root cause analysis, and DEB analysis in relation to FMEA. We are critical to both. We find that both methods could benefit from using the notion of latent conditions, and even applying the concept and vocabulary from the ISO 9000 quality management standard when describing risks.\n\nWe discuss the learning potential of retrospective vs. proactive analysis and are in favour of proactive methods.\n\nWe introduce complexity theory and relate this to our results. Our conclusion is that the operator-centred approach (paper III) seems to be the most effective way of influencing a complex system in a desirable manner, concerning self-organising and emergent properties.",

      "abstract": "Abstract To study animal welfare empirically we need an objective basis for deciding when an animal is suffering. Suffering includes a wide range ofunpleasant emotional states such as fear, boredom, pain, and hunger. Suffering has evolved as a mechanism for avoiding sources ofdanger and threats to fitness. Captive animals often suffer in situations in which they are prevented from doing something that they are highly motivated to do. The “price” an animal is prepared to pay to attain or to escape a situation is an index ofhow the animal “feels” about that situation. Withholding conditions or commodities for which an animal shows “inelastic demand” (i.e., for which it continues to work despite increasing costs) is very likely to cause suffering. In designing environments for animals in zoos, farms, and laboratories, priority should be given to features for which animals show inelastic demand. The care ofanimals can thereby be based on an objective, animal-centered assessment of their needs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract “Wealth,” closely related to the concept of abstract value, refers to the many ways that people create, possess, accumulate, transfer, and store value. Ancient wealth could be stored as material objects: horses, land, and gold tripods. These objects represented recognition from others and promised the perception of worth from other people. Wealth continues to be stored and displayed in similar objects, such as houses, cars, cash, and horses. Contemporary wealth often refers to objects such as capital, stocks, bonds, and treasury bills; even when wealth is completely immaterial it continues to be a means of establishing recognition, rank, and status among people. Life itself, and the time it affords, can signify an ultimate expression of wealth. Time often figures as a possession abundantly held by the wealthy; who spend more of their time away from activities of work or labor, while those without wealth typically labor at more physically demanding and highly managed jobs. Wealth, Adam Smith suggested at one point, referencing Thomas Hobbes, is also power; meaning the power to command or purchase the labor of others (Smith 1970 [1776]: 31). Wealth promises, additionally, the social power to realize desires produced through social recognition.",

      "title": "Atrocity, Banality, Self-Deception",
      "abstract": "Keywords evil, self-deception, banality, atrocity, motivation When talking about evil we must make a fundamental choice about how we are to use the term. We may use it as half of the contrast \"good versus evil,\" in which case it covers everything that is not good. That includes moral incompetence, lack of imagination, willingness to follow orders, overreactions, and a host of other reasons why people who do not have personalities that we would call evil do things that are wrong, often very wrong. Call this the weak reading of evil: evil as wrongdoing. Or we may use it with the meaning suggested by \"evil person,\" \"really evil act,\" \"the evil lurking in all of us,\" and other such idioms. If we do this, we focus on a particular class of actions, and the motives and people that produce them, that arouse a particular moral revulsion in us. Call this the strong reading of evil: evil as atrocity (for more on this contrast see Morton [2004] and Card [2002]). Kubarych, following Peck, thinks of evil in the strong way. Most of the time at any rate: Some of the philosophers, such as Kant, that he draws on are thinking of evil in the weak way, and some of his quotations are from the German, where good/bad/evil distinctions are not drawn in the same way as in English. He explores a general explanation of evil that seems to be targeted at the psychology of extremely abhorrent actions. But, I argue, his account is in danger of collapse in either of two directions. Depending on how we interpret Kubarych's account, it could turn out that it describes all wrongdoing as evil, or, making some different choices, it could turn out that there are no really evil people. The strong reading of evil is definitely the most interesting and potentially fruitful. After all, we have no shortage of satisfying explanations of why people lie to get out of unwelcome appointments, steal to support their children or their drug habits, or defraud investors to become rich. But we do feel deeply puzzled by those who commit torture, serial murder, or genocide. We ask of these people not so much \"Why did he do it?\" as \"How could he do it?\" We feel the need of a philosophical or psychological theory that can give us even a slight handle of these people and their deeds. There are two risks associated with the project of explaining atrocity, though. The first is the risk of accepting unsatisfactory accounts, just because they purport to explain what we desperately want to understand. The second is the risk of supposing that there is a single explanation when the causes of the phenomenon are in fact too varied. On other topics these two risks have often combined to make people believe what seem to us now to be evident falsehoods. Humans have often for example wanted to know the causes of disease, and as a result have accepted blanket explanations, in terms of [End Page 257] evil spirits or lack of faith, that seem ludicrous to us now that we have a better grasp of the variety of factors that can cause our bodies to misfunction. So before asking naively \"Why and how can people do these awful things?\" we should ask \"Is there a deeper causal unity here, beyond the fact that we react to these acts with horror?\" My suspicion is that there is not much unity, that it is asking too much to want a common profile to the psychology of serial killers, or of proponents of genocide, let alone a profile that applies across these and other categories. What we can do, I believe, is describe our concept of evil in such a way that we can leave some parameters to be filled in by a large variety of objective psychological factors. Even this runs the risk that the really relevant factors cannot be forced into the role that the philosophical account requires. In...",

      "title": "Prosocial primates: selfish and unselfish motivations",
      "abstract": "Non-human primates are marked by well-developed prosocial and cooperative tendencies as reflected in the way they support each other in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression. The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is not to be confused with the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i) altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic impulse, which—as in humans—may be born from empathy with the recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of cooperation (i.e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies. This paper further reviews observational and experimental evidence for the reciprocity mechanisms that underlie cooperation among non-relatives, for inequity aversion as a constraint on cooperation and on the way defection is dealt with.",

      "abstract": "In German one says a child is “strange” with adults it does not know, or does not know well: the child may speak little or not at all, will probably stand sucking a finger. But when children are strange in this way they are still at home within themselves, not alienated from their own lives. An adult in a wholly strange environment also may still be at home within himself; indeed, he may depend more on himself, the less a strange environment welcomes him. Alienation from oneself is something quite different, and estrangement is different again (which is what we will have to show in a roundabout way). It is easy to hear where some sounds come from. The word entfremden (“to alienate”) is an old one, originally used in business. Abalienare in Latin means to rid oneself of a thing, to sell something.",

      "title": "International Law's Objects",
      "abstract": "International law’s rich existence in the world can be illuminated by its objects. International law is often developed, conveyed, and authorized through its objects and/or their representation. From the symbolic (the regalia of the head of state and the symbols of sovereignty), to the mundane (a can of dolphin-safe tuna certified as complying with international trade standards), international legal authority can be found in the objects around us. Similarly, the practice of international law often relies on material objects or their image, both as evidence (satellite images, bones of the victims of mass atrocities) and to found authority (for instance, maps and charts). This volume considers these questions: firstly what might the study of international law through objects reveal? What might objects, rather than texts, tell us about sources, recognition of states, construction of territory, law of the sea, or international human rights law? Secondly, what might this scholarly undertaking reveal about the objects - as aims or projects - of international law? How do objects reveal, or perhaps mask, these aims, and what does this tell us about the reasons some (physical or material) objects are foregrounded, and others hidden or ignored. Thirdly what objects, icons, and symbols preoccupy the profession and academy? The personal selection of these objects by leading and emerging scholars worldwide will illuminate the contemporary and historical fascinations of international lawyers. By considering international law in the context of its material culture the authors offer a new and exciting theoretical perspective on the subject.",

One dimension is concerned with attribution of moral blame. Thomas Nagel explains: \"If one negligently leaves the bath running with the baby in it, one will realize, as one bounds up the stairs towards the bathroom, that if the baby has drowned one has done something awful, whereas if it has not one has merely been careless.\" How badly one has behaved and hence how much one should be blamed turns on consequences beyond one's control - on luck. The other dimension concerns the existence and extent of one's responsibility for having done harm, one's obligation to someone harmed to make amends for or repair the harm done. Someone who has been careless and lucky enough not to injure anyone has no such obligation. Someone who has been equally careless and inflicted a devastating injury may well have a ruinous obligation.",

Two ways can result in the ending of a person's life by himself; either suicide or euthanasia. While the former is absolutely illegal in India, the latter is, in the light of Article 21(right to life) of the Indian Constitution, a debatable issue. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, euthanasia means the act or practice of killing or enabling, for purposes of compassion, the death of hopelessly sick or wounded persons in a reasonably painless manner.It can also be seen as 'killing mercy'. According to this procedure, the victim chooses death for himself, mostly because of the victim's medical problems, or some other person on his behalf, and then someone else puts him to death. This is done purely to end the victim's life mercifully, to free him from the incurable illness, the unbearable suffering, and the misery and pain of life.",

      "abstract": "JAVMA, Vol 240, No. 5, March 1, 2012 C and misunderstanding often occur when two people attempt to communicate using different languages. More commonly, confusion arises when two people attempt to communicate using the same language but attach different meanings to the same terms. A good example is the term humane, particularly as it relates to whether the care we provide as veterinarians is humane. The term humane encompasses the best qualities of humankind, including kindness, tenderness, empathy, and compassion. Although all of these behaviors exist to some extent in various animals, animals cannot act in a humane fashion (that is, animal behavior is not judged as humane or inhumane), whereas humans can act in a humane fashion toward other humans and animals. Behavior that is inhumane is lacking in compassion for the suffering of humans and animals; synonyms of inhumanity include unkindness and cruelty. Thus, a veterinarian or animal owner who deliberately chooses to disregard available means to reduce injury or illness in an animal under his or her care could be thought of as inhumane or, in some circumstances, cruel. The definition of cruelty encompasses actions that are inhumane and without pity. The definition of pity encompasses having compassion for the suffering, distress, or troubles of another. Whether an act is cruel depends not only on the act itself, but also on the intent of the act. In my opinion, cruelty involves acts and motivations limited to people. The term welfare signifies a state of being or doing well. The concept of animal welfare has traditionally been founded on the premise that humans have an obligation to act humanely toward animals. In my experience, animal welfare problems are more likely to encompass acts of omission rather than commission (ie, deliberate acts of cruelty). The term compassion is derived from Latin and literally means to suffer with. Thus, compassion encompasses feelings, but more is involved with compassion than simply emotions. According to several modern English dictionaries, two complementary human qualities must be combined to be compassionate. First, we must have empathetic awareness of the suffering, distress, or troubles of another living being. Second, we must have an empathetic desire to help correct the problem. Empathy is the projection of our own thoughts and feelings onto the thoughts and feelings of What does it mean to be humane?",

Most frequently, the term refers to Sexual abstinence or abstention from alcohol or food. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions or practical considerations. Abstinence has diverse forms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities through “sublimation”. Abstinence may also arise from an ascetic element, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline.

      "title": "The Lived-Experience of Aggression in Secondary Schools in South Africa",
      "abstract": "Introduction According to Planalp (1999: 1) the world is forcing its inhabitants to come to terms with emotion. One of these emotions is aggression. Aggression is an integral part of a human being in relationship with his/her self, other persons and the environment. The external manifestations of aggression, whether constructive or destructive is not the starting point of aggression. Aggression develops from childhood and continues into adulthood. In this regard Chamberlain (2000: 2-4) even states that aggression can develop from before birth. Aggression starts within the psychological world of the individual. The way in which the individual interprets his/her perceptions will elicit an emotional response that will effect the person's decision on what to do with his/her interpretation of the world. What matters is the way in which it is expressed--either constructive or destructive behavior. Aggression is expressed in a constructive manner if it is about the survival and personal and healthy growth of the individual, family, group and/or the community. Aggression is expressed in a destructive manner if it harms self and/or others and/or the environment (Tesser, 1995:383-418). According to Kruger, Rech and Van Staden (1993: 9) aggression can be viewed as any type of behavior that is directed to harm, hurt, inflict pain or destroy another person when this person is motivated to avoid such behavior. Aggression can also be self-directed--consciously or unconsciously (self-critical, self-harm, verbal threats and assault). From literature it is clear that aggression should be viewed within a multi-dimensional perspective. Psychosocial, situational-environmental, and biological factors are all viewed as possible contributors to the manifestation of aggression. This indicates that the phenomenon of aggression is embedded within a specific psycho-socio-ecological context. Authors such as Barker (1968:1-9) and Myburgh (1981:7-8) emphasize the importance of studying human behavior and development within the psycho-socio-ecological context. This refers to the physical, social, psychological and volitional (values) environment (Myburgh, 1981:7-8). Psycho-social factors that contribute towards aggressive behavior include inability to cope with frustration; uncomfortable livelihood; exposure to aggressive models such as violence in the media and parents with aggressive behavior; poor socio-economic circumstances especially in urbanized areas; poor family relationships; times of social stress (such as a high inflation rate and increasing divorce statistics), and rejection by peers (Pepler & Sedighdeilami, 1998: 1; Morrisen, Robertson & Harding, 1998: 217; Solomon & Serres, 1999:339-340; Mooij, 1998: 374; Debaryshe & Fryxell, 1998: 205-214; Collings, 1994: 35-37; Pulkkinen & Ramirez, 1991: 69; Krager, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 9-10). Situational-environmental factors that can contribute towards aggressive behavior include competitive sport; physical pain; anxiety; being in a crowd; and air and noise pollution (Smith & Furlong: 1998, 2021-202; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10). Biological factors contributing to aggression include constitutional factors (a person's temperament); genetics; hormonal oactors; neuro-anatomical factors such as neurotransmission and neuro-logical disturbances (Mooij, 1998: 374; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10-11). Currently the South African society is exposed to social stress such as high inflation rates, increasing divorce statistics, increasing suicide and increasing death rates related to AIDS. This can contribute to an increase in aggression in the society, and especially aggressive behavior by adolescents in secondary schools that are destructive in nature. Adolescents are exposed to such aggression but also expose other persons like their peers, parents, educators and school managers to aggression. …",

      "abstract": "Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. non-anthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces 1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, 2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and 3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",

Strictly speaking, trauma to the clenched fist is not an actual bite, but it is a more civilized manner of producing the lesion. Deliberately burying one's teeth into human flesh is reminiscent of primeval savage instincts, if not cannibalism, and impels us to camouflage \"human bite\" with the milder Latin \"morsus humanus.\" The remarkable feature of morsus humanus is the virulent, destructive trauma which so often follows an apparently trivial wound.

In most cases, people tend to describe themselves as “good,” “cultured,” and “decent,” while other nations are considered “bad,” “uncultured,” or “mean.” However, self‐loathing, self‐depreciation, or self‐criticism are not uncommon in different descriptions of national characters. Both positive and negative portrayals are fluid and relate to specific events or recent developments. Others have a longer history and reflect certain stereotypes or expectations about the typical behavior of a representative member of a national group. Consider a well‐known joke about some European nations: “What are Heaven and Hell? Heaven is when the restaurant chef is French, the cop is British, the auto mechanic is German, the planner is Swiss, and the lover is Italian. In Hell, everything is out of order: The chef is British, the policeman is German, the mechanic is French, the planner is Italian, and the lover is Swiss.” This old joke embodies simplistic views of national character.",

In two studies (N = 160; 240), American and Indian participants indicated their emotional reaction to (stories depicting) sacred or nonsacred violations, each either with or without pathogens. Both Americans and Indians felt \"grossed out\" (a term for core disgust) by events with pathogens (whether violations of the sacred or not). They felt disgusted and angered, but not grossed out, by violations of the sacred. For both Americans and Indians, grossed out was never the modal emotion when a sacred violation did not involve pathogens. Results were inconsistent with a focus on any single emotion: sacred violations were associated with several different negative emotions.

Now, let us consider how to create, or in better terms, how to ‘recreate’ such a precious asset. The thoughts of important personalities are vitally important for the entire world. In this research paper, the researchers are trying to explore such an opportunity through the possibilities offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cosmic Energy (CE).\r\nResearch Goal: To design means to recreate humans through AI and CE.\r\nMethod: The formulas developed to execute the mission, along with the related explanations have been given.

We constantly apply it in interactions between people, organizations, animals, and even artifacts. We use it instinctively and implicitly in closed and static systems, or consciously and explicitly in open or dynamic systems. An epitome for the former case is a small village, where everybody knows everybody, and the villagers instinctively use their knowledge or stereotypes to trust or distrust their neighbors. A big city exemplifies the latter case, where people use explicit rules of behavior in diverse trust relationships. We already use trust in computing systems extensively, although usually subconsciously. The challenge for exploiting trust in computing lies in extending the use of trust-based solutions, first to artificial entities such as software agents or subsystems, then to human users' subconscious choices.",

      "abstract": "An important difference between persons and other creatures is that only persons can be morally responsible for what they do. When we accept that someone is a morally responsible agent, this typically involves more than holding a particular belief about him; it entails a willingness to adopt certain attitudes toward that person and to behave toward him in certain kinds of ways. Imagine, for example, that you return home one evening and find your treasured Waterford vase shattered on the dining room floor. Discovering that the vase has been purposely shattered by a malicious houseguest will give rise to a set of reactions much different than those which would seem appropriate were you to discover that the vase had been accidentally toppled from the shelf by your clumsy cat. In the latter case, you might feel regret and perhaps even anger at your cat, but you would hardly feel the same sort of resentment and moral indignation that would seem warranted had your guest intentionally broken the vase in order to hurt you. Moreover, it would be appropriate to blame your guest and to hold him responsible for the misdeed in a way much different from the way in which you might discipline your cat and try to train him not to climb on the furniture in the future.",

      "title": "The moral justification for keeping animals in captivity",
      "abstract": "I attempt a reasoned, qualified defence of zoos, but in full recognition of moral challenge to them. This challenge is mainly examined in chapters 3 to 7. Animals are indeed free in wild, and must lose that freedom in some degree in zoos (3)*. However animal captivity need only share with human captivity its being brought about by an external agent, it can and should be captivity in a technical sense only, and at its best can clearly be morally acceptable (3). But there appear to be in all essential respects differences only of degree between animals and humans (4) and no reason therefore why their moral claims upon us should be any different in principle from humans' claims (5). As, in addition, there appears to be a dominating tendency in human nature which, though no doubt useful or even essential in itself, also on occasion allows us to be oblivious to our own cruelty to other humans or animals or, worse, actively to enjoy such cruelty, bad captivity is a real possibility which needs to be vigorously guarded against (6). A comparison of respective advantages for an animal of free and captive life shows that captivity can have advantages of longer, more comfortable life with medical attention, but likely drawback of an absence of normal problems of living, especially food-seeking, in which animals, adapted to their natural ways of life by selection through millions of years, are likely to find satisfaction (7). However state of domestication is not normally regarded as morally objectionable, and animals in zoos are in fact slightly domesticated (8). Interestingly, domesticated animals also retain far more of their natural behaviour than is normally appreciated (8) . Certain criteria, such as health, breeding, and occurrence of natural behaviour, enable us both to assess wellbeing or otherwise of captive animals kept in different ways, and to improve quality of animal-keeping, as well as providing us with a means of articulating specifically and scientifically which ways of keeping certain animals are morally wrong, and which animals, if any, should not be kept at all (9). Study of an animal's natural behaviour and way of life is here of fundamental importance, as it also is in assessing moral acceptability of ways of keeping domesticated animals (9). Certain animals in zoos and ways of keeping them are considered in light of criteria, and it is suggested that there are clear indications in some cases of animals' wellbeing in captivity (10). There are also undoubted failings in much zookeeping, and it is emphasised that keeping animals should be a continuing process of search for improvements. While traditional expertise is of great value, importance also of being open to and endeavouring to make fullest use of new ethological and other scientific knowledge cannot be over-emphasised (10). The major justification for keeping any animals captive must be a demonstration of their wellbeing on lines above (9 and 10), but there are powerful supplementary justifications which I examine in chapters 11 to 16. I see wildlife conservation as part of a moral attitude of responsibility (or stewardship) towards anything which may reasonably be regarded as of value (11). Valuing itself I see as a fundamental moral concept, and stewardship, which term I use without any implied religious connotations, as necessarily avoiding any narrowly selfish or purely financial motivation in, especially, management of natural world (11). Animals themselves have exceptional and remarkable claims for being conserved, aesthetic as well as scientific (12). Respect for their own lives as individuals (as seen in 4 and 5 above) should also be a motive for their conservation (12) . While conservation in must be our primary concern, zoos have a considerable supplementary conservation role to play (13). This role, if zoos can only grasp it responsibly as they should, will transform them from being independent wildlife consumers of past history into cooperating guardians of centrally managed captive populations of endangered and other species, whose genetic variation will be safeguarded with a view to future reintroductions if and when necessary (13). Zoos' scientific and educational roles (14 and 15 respectively) also have strong conservational connections. Zoos may also assist protection of natural areas by satisfying much of humans' urge for wildlife contact: zoos are visited by millions of people who could never, in comparable numbers, visit the wild without irreparably damaging it.

      "title": "AN INTERPRETATION OF THE ‘DISPLACEMENT’ PHENOMENON*",
      "abstract": "The observations that animals obstructed in the execution of a particular ongoing or customary activity (e.g. attacking, copulating) tend either to direct the same activity toward another object or to engage in a completely different activity (e.g. doodling, grooming, preening) have traditionally been described as ‘displacement phenomena’. Both psychologists and ethologists currently interpret these phenomena in terms of some kind of displacement mechanism , which is assumed to displace the ‘energy’ or ‘drive’ from one reaction system to another. This type of interpretation is vague and ad hoc , and at best provides only a redundant description of the observed phenomena. The alternative interpretation proposed here looks upon the problem of the occurrence of the so‐called displacement activities as a special case of the general question of the factors determining the occurrence of any activity that exists in an animal's repertoire. In particular, it is suggested that all instances of displacement phenomena can be adequately accounted for in terms of the operation of three factors: ( a ) an increase in the level of arousal of the animal brought about by the obstructing event, ( b ) the relative habit strengths of the various activities in the repertoire of the animal, and ( c ) the nature of the sensory cues provided by the altered stimulus situation. This formulation incorporates the important ethological and psychological findings, and provides an interpretation of displacement phenomena which is not ad hoc and which suggests new lines of experimental work.",

But this will not do if we are reluctant to suppose that, in addition to there are such things as times. (ii) We might consider saying that there are three different occasions such that the occurs on the earliest and on the latest and not on the one in the middle. But what are the things we would then be calling occasions? (iii) We might say that, if an recurs, then there are q, r, and s of this sort: r occurs after q, and s occurs after r, and is exemplified or instantiated in q and in s and not in r. In this case, we would appeal to two quite different sets of entities: abstract events, or event types, such as p, which may be instantiated or exemplified in concrete events such as q, r, and s. This surely would be to multiply entities at a very early point. (iv) I suggest that, instead of positing such entities as times, occasions, or concrete events, we describe recurrence by making use of the concept of the negation of an event. We could say tenselessly that an if and only if the occurs and then after that the negation of the occurs and then after that the occurs.

Man by reason of his history, his origin from Adam, cannot fulfil the purpose of his first creation; fallen from grace, with his natural strength impaired, his state is that of original sin. The world is the system man builds up in self seeking; the flesh is man’s desire, greedy for life, asserting itself against God. Each actual sin he commits is his personal endorsement of the state in which he is born. Though he is prone to sin, though he is often sinful, man is not evil by nature; he tries to escape, he longs for beauty, for justice, for truth, above all for love. He can pervert these things, for he is free; for the same reason he can choose them, and pursue them when they elude his grasp. He has imagined beings who will bring these things to him, he has followed prophets and elaborated techniques. He has known failure and he has seen himself as failing; sometimes he comes near to a knowledge of sin.",

      "title": "The rotten apple in the barrel has a bug in it: how the analogy of parasitic infection may shed light on the causes of & solutions to recent financial scandals",
      "abstract": "Time and time again, corporate scandals (lately in the banking sector) remind us of the frailty of human standards and values: ethical conduct is unreliable. The authors have personal experience, drawn from consultancy and research, of the troubling ease with which groups of employees can subvert and expose to existential risk otherwise sound organisations. Daily, occasional and actions under stress may each and all demonstrate forms of behaviour at substantial odds from what individuals would tolerate, enable or support. These individuals are not necessarily behaving irrationally, nor motivated solely by personal gain: and yet their actions are greedy. They put at risk the stability of the overall organisation for the promise of an easier (but unregulated, unsafe or unpalatable) workload, reward or task list.\r\nIn this sense, then, a biological analogy would be of a parasitical infection that drains energy from a host, reducing its ability to remain healthy or, as some real-world parasites do, changing the behaviour of the host such that it is persuaded that unconventional actions are natural, intuitive. The very conditions of work may have a profound influence here: “This dysfunctional perspective is reinforced by contemporary corporate monoculture where employees live in a bubble, log obscene hours, and vacation with their co-workers. As a consequence giant corporations are dogmatically insular with their own warped code of ethics and worldview” (Burnett 2011).\r\nThis paper will seek to shed light on the mechanisms by which teams in organisations come to undertake behaviours which out at risk the sustainability and security of the whole. Here, then, for example, the socially-responsible aspirations and benchmarks of financial institutions are compromised. Supposed to build long-term shareholder value by taking into strategic account the need for engagement and transparency about the company, how it creates value for its stakeholders, how it manages risk and contributes to society – all of these can be undermined by rogue traders (Cf. Nick Leeson, Enron, Parmalat ,NorthernRock, Madoff, LIBOR, the London Whale, RBS, Co-op, RBS GRG). As an American author helpfully puts it: “parasitic accountants […] have subverted America's entrepreneurial spirit and jeopardized the common good” (Burnett 2011).",

      "abstract": "I shall use the description 'social' primarily to refer to behaviour by the elderly person which involves him or her, directly or indirectly, with other people. The importance of such interaction to elderly people was spelt out by Freud just over sixty years ago (in 1926), when in Vienna he addressed a group of non-medical people who had come together to celebrate his seventieth birthday. He recalled a theme he first enunciated in his middle 60s, which he spelt out more explicitly in 1930 in his book Civilisation and its Discontents (Freud, 1973). He then wrote: We are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our own body, which is doomed to decay and dissolution and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety as warning signals; from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations with other human beings. The suffering which comes from this last source is perhaps more painful to us than any other.… Against the suffering which may come upon one from human relationships the readiest safeguard is voluntary isolation, keeping oneself aloof from other people.… There is, indeed, another and better path to happiness — that of becoming a member of the human community.

      "abstract": "To the outsider, a foreign legal system may at times appear irrational, with a belief in the efficacy, usually with supernatural assistance, of curses, oaths and ordeals, and that animals may properly be punished, even restrained from anti-human behaviour, after a criminal trial. But caution must be exercised. There may be little real belief that the deity will intervene—for instance, that the ordeal will reveal guilt or innocence. Rather, the society may be faced with an intolerable problem, with no reasonable solution, and the participants may resort to extraordinary legal measures as a “Last Best Chance”, or “The Second Best”. Something has to be done, even if nothing satisfactory can be done. This dodge reveals itself by its use being restricted to a few situations. Thus in ancient Hebrew law ritual legal cursing is not used as a punishment, and in fact is found only where a husband accuses his wife of adultery but has not the very strict evidence required by law. The medieval ordeal was normally used only for serious offences and where there was considerable evidence against the accused. The main purpose of “The Last Best Chance” is to produce a result but, paradoxically perhaps, it serves to preserve the integrity of the system.",

      "abstract": "IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION WE ARE CONCERNED WITH tolerance, not as a physical problem, but as a problem of human relations. In this context, ‘to tolerate’ generally means to endure, suffer or put up with a person, activity, idea or organization of which or whom one does not really approve. One can ‘put up with’ an item both when one can and cannot do anything about it. For example, one can ‘put up with’ the excesses of a ruler whose behaviour one has no power to amend. Equally, one can ‘put up with’ the excesses of a child even where one has no need to do so. In the second case, one has control; in the first, one does not. Both cases could be advanced as instances of ‘tolerance’. But cases of the first sort (powerlessness) I shall label as instances of ‘acquiescence’ or ‘sufferance’ or ‘endurance’, since it is obvious that acquiescence typically flows from powerlessness. I shall label cases of the second sort (powerfulness) as instances of tolerance. It is clear in any event that these two types of case are distinct, and, for the purposes of this discussion, at least, differential labelling is essential. In this context, an agent will be said to ‘tolerate’ an item where the item is disliked or disapproved and is yet voluntarily endured. On this definition it is plain that tolerance requires some form of self-restraint by the tolerator.",

      "abstract": "Animals are amongst the most vulnerable of all sentient beings. Animal neglect and abuse may involve a single animal and one person, or hundreds of animals and many people. Animals and people are victims of the same types of fatal injury and severe neglect; however, the anatomy and physiology of different animal species and even breeds of animals are a unique challenge for veterinary pathologists. Identifying and describing external lesions of blunt force trauma and projectile wounds requires that the entire skin be reflected from the animal because fur and feathers partially or totally mask the injuries. Because quadrupeds or birds may react differently to the same traumatic force applied to bipedal humans, extrapolating from medical forensic pathology must be done with caution. Animal abuse, however, does not occur in a vacuum. An established link exists between animal abuse, interpersonal violence, and other serious crimes. Using examples, this paper describes specific injuries in abused and neglected animals in the context of domestic violence, interpersonal violence, mental illness, and drug addiction. Medical examiners should be aware that animal abuse affects not only the animal, but individuals, families, and society as a whole.",

      "abstract": "It is by now familiar to distinguish moral theories according to whether their basic principle or principles are formulated in terms of goals, rights, or duties. Consequentialist theories are goal-based in this sense, though consequentialists have often argued that nonbasic moral rights or duties can be derived from a basic goal-promotion principle. Within this framework, Alan Donagan's account of common or Judeo-Christian morality is duty-based. He takes the fundamental principle of morality to be, “It is impermissible not to respect every human being, oneself or any other, as a rational creature.” First-order precepts are as well duties, specifically, those concerned with the taking of human life and, in particular, absolute duties: “No man may at will kill another,” “It is impermissible to kill an innocent human being,” or, finally, “It is absolutely impermissible to commit murder.” The duty regarding killing concerns both killing oneself as well as killing another, though Donagan specifies several qualifications to the prohibition of suicide. I will argue here that, in making the basic moral principle regarding taking human life both a duty and absolute, Donagan is led to an unacceptable moral position regarding the taking of human life. His position is subject to some criticisms commonly made by consequentialists and to others associated with rights-based views, each of which points to what I believe is a more acceptable position on this issue.",

      "abstract": "Chapter 8 studies how one experiences otherness (a displacement of social identity) in one's own country (inner exile), facing a fall in status and humiliation (eating what is not edible, suffering from infamy and lack of charity) and, at times, facing 'uncanny' situations. This chapter shows how the dynamic of deviation is soon transformed into a dynamic of humiliation and degradation, and how one tumbles down the social ladder. Making a detour via a debasing form of otherness while staying in one's homeland amounts to experiencing not what is elsewhere but what lies at the bottom, to hitting rock bottom at home. The horizontal dynamic of (external) exile gives way to the vertical dynamic of (internal) degradation, also raising the question of whether one can recover from it. Fall in status, humiliating punishment, refusal of hospitality, denial of charity and dietary degradation posing a threat to sanity are generally experienced when the exile finds himself in a hostile foreign territory. Yet the internal exile suffers from the same dynamic of debasement in his homeland, and there may be certain similarities with facing the sudden appearance of the 'uncanny'.",

Laws cannot replace morality without becoming oppressive. If most of us did not embrace morality, life for all of us would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,” as Hobbes famously put it.53 To live our lives, we need morality. To understand our lives, we need to understand morality. On a more personal level, we all need to make choices, many of which involve moral considerations. We face temptations to cheat on taxes or spouses, to break a promise that we regret making, to lie in order to gain an advantage in a competition, to strike out at someone who angers us, to ignore someone who needs us, and even to steal when we are needy ourselves.",

It is not at all unusual for us to see people doing something that they appear to be completely unaware of. By this I don't just mean that they might be doing things that are just outside the focus of their consciousness, like twitching or tapping their feet. We always exhibit behaviour that we are not conscious of in this sense. This sort of 'preconscious' behaviour is not controversial (Freud, 1957). But it may be that I think they are purposefully and subtly putting me in a difficult position, irritating me or making me feel guilty. If challenged, they would strenuously deny what I think they're doing, disavowing it as a purposeful action. Now it could be that it's just me who is being oversensitive. Perhaps I often think other people are trying to irritate me or make me feel guilty — it's a characteristic of my construing and not a feature of their personality.

      "abstract": "Ten domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) of different breeds and ages were exposed to 2 different social cues indicating the location of hidden food, each provided by both a human and a conspecific (for a total of 4 different social cues). For the local enhancement cue, the approached the location where food was hidden and then stayed beside it. For the gaze and point cue, the stood equidistant between 2 hiding locations and bodily oriented and gazed toward the 1 in which food was hidden (the human also pointed). Eight of the 10 subjects, including the one 6-month-old juvenile, were above chance with 2 or more cues. Results are discussed in terms of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic processes by means of which dogs come to use social cues to locate food. The use of social cues to locate food and other important entities in the environment is a skill with obvious adaptive benefits. For example, an informant may look toward an entity, and this look may be accompanied by both head and body orientation to the same location and sometimes by other behaviors such as vocalizations or travel toward the target location. The ability of observer individuals to exploit social cues of this type enables them to benefit from knowledge possessed only by specific groupmates. Despite the potential importance of this social ability for the foraging of many highly social species such as mammals, there has been very little systematic research in this area. Virtually all of the relevant research has been conducted with nonhuman primates and their skills of gaze following. There are two basic experimental paradigms, and these have produced different sets of results. The first paradigm is simple gaze following in which 1 individual orients its head and eyes in a certain direction (sometimes accompanied by gestures), and another individual either does or does not orient itself similarly. For example, Itakura (1996) had a human approach nonhuman primate individuals and either look or look and manually point to the right or left. Many of the 11 different nonhuman primate species tested visually tracked the pointing gesture, but only 1 (an orangutan) visually followed gaze direction by itself. Using a similar methodology, Povinelli and Eddy (1996a) also found positive results for 6 juvenile chimpanzees following the gaze of",

      "title": "Hostile, Sexual, and Other Social Behaviour Patterns of the Spice Finch (Lonchura Punctulata) in Captivity",
      "abstract": "Three main groups of social reactions, commonly observed in captive Spice Finches, are the main subjects of this paper. The first group comprises a number of patterns reflecting the Spice Finch's highly gregarious nature and often helping to maintain flock integration: Call Notes, Tail-flicking (a ritualized locomotory intention movement), clumping (roosting or sitting absolutely side by side), and social preening. The Spice Finch's general social behaviour suggests that the gregariousness of the species is due to some motivation partially independent of any other possibly activated tendencies. The same may be of the marked restlessness shown in the early mornings throughout the year. The second group contains many hostile activities : attack, escape, and patterns obviously produced by a simultaneous conflict or combination of attack and escape motivations. Among these last, several stretch postures are particularly interesting : the fact that each of them may frequently occur just before attack, just before escape and in numerous intermediate situations indicates that they are all ambivalent locomotory intention movements similar to one another in every respect except orientation. Another pattern resulting from simultaneously activated attack and escape tendencies, the Ruffle, is a ritualized display. This pattern bears some physical resemblance to friendly social preening invitation and it is tentatively suggested that it helps to avert attack by means of this resemblance. Despite the occasional frequency of Ruffling, and the rarer appearance of certain vocal patterns, Spice Finch hostile behaviour is much less ritualized than that of many other species. This paucity of ritualization, with the accompanying sombreness of plumage and weakness of voice, is probably correlated with the extreme gregariousness - which has probably reduced the need for behaviour patterns conspicuous over long distances. The third group, much the most heterogeneous, comprises sexual activities and other activities more or less closely associated with sexual performances. One such pattern, the masculine Jingle (reminiscent of, but functionally unlike, the true or advertising song of other passerines), is also common in non-sexual situations, and must, again, have some largely independent motivation. Typical and atypical behaviour before, during, and after copulation itself is described in some detail. The pre-copulatory sequence of patterns is almost always elaborate, including unritualized ambivalent postures and movements, ritualized displays, and (possibly) one conventional displacement activity. Another striking pre-copulatory performance, playing with nest-material, seems to result from a type of spark-over or re-routing of motivation very different from the spark-over responsible for conventional displacement activities. This pre-copulatory nest-building is not produced by a surplus of motivation (as would be the case in conventional conflict or thwarting), but apparently, instead, by an insufficiency of sexual motivation, too weak to be expressed in overt sexual acts. The theoretical advantages of such an arrangement are very great. The actual copulation is quick and simple, but there are violent post-copulatory performances. The whole series of patterns before, during, and after copulation can be understood as the result, in both sexes, of simultaneously activated attack, escape, and sexual tendencies of varying strengths, with, in the male, an added simultaneous Jingling tendency.",

      "title": "On Death and Human Existence",
      "abstract": "The topic of death, now fashionable and much discussed, raises questions in almost every field of thought. Death has always been thought hateful, or almost always; hateful, and enigmatic. In the Christian and Jewish traditions death has always been terrible, something that reveals the distance between God and man and man’s dereliction; and it is therefore thought to be something that in some obscure sense ought not to happen. The primitive account of the passion in Mark and Matthew—characteristically and no doubt deliberately omitted by Luke—records the great cry of agony taken from Psalm 22: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” In the same psalm we find: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, it is melted within my breast . . . and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; thou dost lay me in the dust of death.” Here is no attempt to prettify death or to make the process of dying acceptable. Death is intolerable. Of course, there are other biblical ways of looking at death. In (and out of) the Bible we are given the picture of the just man full of years and honour who dies surrounded by his children and his children’s children. This is a fortunate death, and if to this we add the element contributed by Christianity, namely, the reception of the eucharist (viaticum, journey money, analogous to the placing of a coin in the dead man’s mouth to pay Charon’s ferry charges), and the anointing (formerly) of those parts of the body that have so often taken us away from God, and the sacramental remission of sin through confession and absolution, we understand how this can properly be called “a happy death.”",

In medicine, trauma means a physical injury caused by impact, force, or object penetrating the skin. In psychology, psychological trauma refers to an emotional or psychological injury, usually resulting from an extremely stressful or life‐threatening situation. It is common to differentiate between man‐made trauma or disasters and natural disasters. Man‐made is further differentiated between trauma resulting from accidents or unintended damage, loss and breakdown of systems, and trauma resulting from the ultimate betrayal as in sexual abuse and violence against children, and the intentional infliction of severe pain and systematic destruction of human mind and dignity as in torture. As will become clear, intentions, meanings, and understanding are important elements in the context of psychological trauma.

It would appear, then, that the dog's sentiency—its capability to feel pain—establishes some form of human obligation such that, for example, one cannot with moral impunity bash open the skulls of domestic animals for personal enjoyment. Indeed, such sentiency grounds various philosophical theories of animal rights. For example, Regan (1986) argues that ‘[p]ain is pain wheresoever it occurs. If your neighbor's causing you pain is wrong because of the pain that is caused, we cannot rationally ignore or dismiss the moral relevance of the pain your dog feels’ (p. 33).",

In naturally living species, conflicts arise over the control of resources – principally food, shelter and mates; in most instances a social interaction decides the outcome of a contest, with ritualised displays taking the place of direct physical confrontation. Most contests will be decided quickly, with the ‘loser’ displaying a submissive posture or gesture, and quickly retreating with little harm done. The term ‘agonistic’ is normally used to describe all the features of such an encounter, which may or may not include actual physical aggression.",

      "title": "Twelve Thousand Criminals",
      "abstract": "A study by our psychiatric department of the criminals admitted to the Virginia State Penitentiary has revealed findings that should be of value in a more logical handling of this major community problem. It is fair to say that the criminal as a whole is an inadequate personality. He is inadequate in some phases of his personality development. He cannot or will not meet the problems that present themselves as his adequate neighbor does. In his attempt to maintain security and to carry on his self-preservation, he has not been able to play the game according to the rules and customs that have as their purpose a social orderliness which in turn will give to the individual and to the mass the greatest happiness. The psychiatric department is concerned about the forces motivating abnormal reactions, or crime, in these cases. We have constantly attempted to keep before us the problem of the individual as an organism. Thus, in our present civilization this organism is constantly in a state of reaction to its environment. The way in which one reacts to environment is, as I have observed, more dependent upon the organization of the individual than the stimulus to which one reacts. The monotonous repetition of the stress and strain of unusual circumstances-broken homes, foreign born, feeblemindedness, worry, and financial difficulties-is recorded and tabulated with the greatest exactitude as causative factors of crime. We cannot overlook the large number of individuals who have gone through all of the above so-called causes of crime who have never committed crime. Furthermore, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the individual who has committed crime continues frequently to commit crime. Thus I cannot help but conclude that criminal reaction is not wholly explained by the nature of the stimulus, but is dependent primarily upon the individualhis original endowments plus the changes which have been caused by past experiences and disease. Crime is motivated by processes of mentation and the forces operating to produce these reactions are to be attacked if we are to prevent crime.",

      "title": "Lost in Love",
      "abstract": "Humans have evolved three different brain systems for mating and reproduction. While the first is for sex drive, the second is for romantic love and implies tenderness, commitment, passion, desire, giddiness, euphoria, jealousy, and possessiveness towards the partner. The third is attachment, i.e., the sense of security you can feel with a long-term partner. Love is a greater impulse than the sex drive and it is rooted in the most ancient brain areas, alongside the urges of hunger and thirst. As such, love participates in the shaping of human nature and individual identity. In this chapter, I will try to describe this perspective of love, focusing on what happens in the brain and rejecting the romantic picture. When falling in love, you are not only overwhelmed by romantic feelings; you also feel deeply attached to the object of your affection. Moreover, when the reward brain circuit is active, the subject feels a strong motivation to risk everything to win life's biggest prize: the partner. Finally, it will be argued that love is a kind of addiction able to force people in pathological pathways when other typical circumstances occur.",

      "title": "Experiencing a shame response as a precursor to violence.",
      "abstract": "The shame response is a primitive physiological response to a rejection of oneself by another. The discomfort of this response may vary from intense physical pain to one that is barely noticeable, if at all. When this pain is sufficient, it causes anger that may be directed outward against another or inward against oneself. The intensity of the shame response, hence the intensity of the pain and anger, is related to the significance of the other, the significance of witnesses to the rejection, one's vulnerability, whether or not the rejection is of oneself or an aspect of oneself, and if the rejection comes as a surprise. When most intense (i.e., most painful), the shame response may include a tightness of the throat, nausea, stomach pain, and a sense that the contents of one's chest and abdomen are collapsing, exploding, or imploding. In reviewing what preceded an act of violence, it is necessary to determine whether the assailant had experienced a shame response and how intense it was. Understanding that a shame response can lead to anger and violence allows for the prevention of violence. This requires that individuals do not experience rejections that are so painful as to lead to violence.",

      "abstract": "The concept of the nature of Islamic education in the perspective of the Koran and Hadith from the literature review that was carried out, there were several findings in the research including; First, etymologically, Fitrah means al-khilqah (instinct, nature) and al-thabī'ah (nature, character, character) which Allah swt created in humans. Fitrah is also taken from the word al-fathr which means shaq (split). From this meaning, other meanings are born, including creator or event. Second, all human nature in the form of the potential for piety, apart from trying to grow and develop, must and need to be educated and directed. Because the influence of parents (representing the environment in the form of association, reading, education, and so on) can affect humans to be bad, evil and so on. Third, if the child has a basic nature that is seen as an evil trait, educational efforts are to educate, direct and focus on eliminating and replacing or at least reducing the elements of the crime. Fourth, humans are blessed with two extraordinary potentials, namely reason ('aql) and free will (nafs). It turns out that these two potentials can be the cause of an advantage that is difficult to imagine, but at the same time can be a very fatal weakness as well.",

      "abstract": "Expelling materials forcefully from any of the body orifices during coughing or Valsalva manoeuvre (straining) on defaecation generates a sudden rise in pressure in the head, chest and abdomen simultaneously with compression of structures contained therein, resulting in a widespread crushing effect. Clinical observations that provide instances of major focal injuries due to this mechanical factor, evoke an argument that other, minor, concealed, recurrent injuries exist. The cumulative effects of these recurrent mechanical injuries and the body responses to them cannot be totally chaotic and are bound to result in focal and/or systemic effects resembling those due to common non-communicable diseases. On the other hand, major environmental risk factors of common non-communicable diseases are found to be responsible directly or indirectly for forceful expulsion of materials from body orifices. Thus, because of the observed non-random pattern of relationships which are unlikely to be due to chance it is tempting to speculate that mechanical injury may be an important common pathway linking diverse environmental risk factors with common non-communicable diseases.",

I argue that to ‘throw away’ humanity is not to lose or extinguish it, but rather to refuse or otherwise fail to claim the respect that it authorizes one to claim. If I refuse or fail to make this claim, there is a sense in which I become a thing, and I leave others no choice but to treat me as such. This is compatible with their respect for humanity in my person.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the nature of pathologization in general and the pathologization of love in therapeutic care in particular. “Pathologized or pathologization[u1] ,” means an event, person, action, thought, feeling, or circumstance that is de-valuated as “less than,” as compromised or broken, and unwittingly (ironically, in the name of love) demeaned, belittled, ignored, jettisoned or ostracized for its not-enough-ness, its incorrectness, or its inadequacy in light of rank-ordered scales of measured worth. The pathologist presumes an essentialist hegemony [ctsq2] should be healthy love, consequentiality, views any expression less than this prescription as a privation or pathologization of healthy love, and is thus immature, ill, or unethical. Common ways therapists pathologize love in therapeutic space include the use of a modified against nature argument; which today is reframed as an against the status quo argument. The use of inflection and body language that communicates disapproval are, enacting[u3] ideologies of deficit-correction that inherently stigmatize, interpreting expressions of love “as other than it is,” or, “as nothing but something else,” such as adoration interpreted as really dependency or teenaged pining as merely raging hormones. Essentialist rank-ordered scaling inherent in these forms of pathologization is deconstructed, then explored in terms of the impact of this deconstruction in therapeutic care. The essay is concluded[u4] with suggestions of how to care for expressions of love in non-pathologizing ways within therapeutic space.",

      "title": "A Note on Willing the First Time",
      "abstract": "A NOTE ON WILLING THE FIRST TIME IT is commonplace today to argue against the existence of the will and volitional acts. The example often cited as grounds for a crucial argument against its existence involves the case in which a person \"wills\" to move a part of his body for the first time. According to this example, one \" wills \" that a part of his body move, and this occasion is the first time that one has tried to move this particular part of the body-eyebrow, toe, finger, etc. The argument is that previous experience of the movement of a particular part is necessary before one can will it to move for the first time; otherwise one would be completely surprised at the result. The argument has been used by many philosophers. Prichard / for example, finds this argument so persuasive against his belief that the will exists that he says: \" To this objection I have to confess that I cannot see an answer.\" Melden uses the argument as a basis to reject acts of volition: . . . to say that one wills the movement of certain muscles is not to answer the question, \"How does one move those muscles?\"; it is in fact to reject it. If this is the outcome, why not refuse to plunge into the morass and reject the initial question, \"How does one raise one's arm?\", by saying, \"One just does.\" If, on the other hand, \" willing a muscle movement\" does not mean \" moving a muscle,\" what on earth can it possibly mean? 2 Finally, the argument is found in the writings of William James, and it was his presentation which was relied upon by Prichard and Melden: 3 The movements we have studied hitherto have been automatic and reflex, and (on the first occasion of their performance, at any 1 Prichard, Moral Obligation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1949), p. 197. 2 Melden, \"Willing,\" The Philosophical Review, LXIX (October, 1960). • W.

The movements to the study of which we now address ourselves being desired and intended beforehand , are, of course, done with full prevision of what they are to be. It follows from this that voluntary movements must be secondary, not primary functions of our organism. This is the first point to understand in the psychology of volition. Reflex is instinctive, and emotional movements are all primary performances. The nerve centers are so organized that a certain stimuli pull the trigger of certain explosive parts; and a creature going through one of these explosions for the first time undergoes an entirely novel experience. . . . Of course, if such a reaction has many times occurred, we learn what to expect of ourselves, and can then foresee our conduct, even though it remains as involuntary and uncontrollable as it was before. But if, in voluntary action properly so-called, the act must be foreseen, it follows that no creature not endowed with divinatory power can perform an act voluntarily for the first time. When a particular movement, having once occurred in a random, reflex, or involuntary way, has left an image of itself in the memory, then the movement can be desired again, proposed as an end, and deliberately willed. But it is impossible to see how it could be willed before. James here maintains that because voluntary actions are done with prevision of what they are to be, we must have learned through previous experience what follows from a particular volition. Hence no person, he argues, can perform a voluntary act for the first time, as there is no way of knowing what would happen. The best way to examine this argument is to begin by noting the two classes of changes allegedly caused by volition: physical (muscle movements) and mental (thoughts) .4 These two classes are reflected by the two claims that I can will to raise my arm and I can will to change my thoughts. Now the traditional argument represented by James, Pichard, Melden, etc., • I am here neither claiming that there is such an entity...",

      "abstract": "Abstract Others in this symposium have amply demonstrated that the practice of torture through the years—apart from the physical and psychic pain visited on the victims—has been fraught with risks to those who inflict it as well. The torturer through history can be characterized as naive (in his hope that confession or disclosure will be accurate) or as cynical (in his indifference to the inaccuracy that usually follows from the practice), or as self-absorbed (in his need for the torture victim to utter formulas that support the torturer’s worldview) or as sadomasochistic (in his literal brutality, often tempered by the phrase “this hurts me more than it hurts you”). None of these descriptions reflects well on the torturer or the society condoning the practice. Against these risks, periodically, apologists for the practice invoke special emergency conditions (whether spiritual or geopolitical), as though the world had never before seen such conditions.",

      "title": "On the Unifier—Multiplier Controversy",
      "abstract": "Many recent discussions of the identity and individuation of actions focus on attempts to find satisfactory answers to questions like, “When, if ever, is a shooting (stabbing, poisoning, etc.) a killing?” Those who attempt to answer such questions divide themselves, on the whole, into two opposing groups. I. Thalberg has conveniently labelled the members of one group ‘unifiers’, and the members of the other group ‘multipliers’. The unifier account is commonly attributed to philosophers such as G. E. M. Anscombe and Donald Davidson. Proponents of this account characteristically believe that many non-basic actions (where ‘basic’ is defined in terms of bodily movements) such as shootings, killings, etc., are identical with those basic actions by means of which the non-basic ones are performed. This position is indicated in the following remarks: … in moving her hand, the queen was doing something that caused the death of the king. These are two descriptions of the same event — the queen moved her hand in that way; she did something that caused the death of the king. (Or to put it, as I would rather, in terms of a definite description: The moving of her hand by the queen on that occasion was identical with her doing something that caused the death of the king.) Doing something that causes a death is identical with causing a death. But there is no distinction to be made between causing the death of a person and killing him.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During the last century it has often been argued that mind emerges from matter. Values, on the other hand, were rather thought to be (merely) supervenient. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that values are at least conceptually (or epistemically) emergent on neutral facts. This process of emergence, of course, is a temporal process. It may have taken a long time for certain values to arise, and they presuppose conscious memory and expectation. Moreover, even when constituted, values involve time. They do so mainly in two ways. Firstly, by having a temporal aspect, as in certain moral virtues and obligations. Secondly, by having time itself as their object. Examples can be seen in religion (sacred/secular time), economy (“time is money”, time can be cheap or expensive, wasted or gained), sport (priority), science (idem) and art (rhythm and related properties).",

      "title": "Sticks and Stones: The Role of Law in the Dynamics of Hate",
      "abstract": "Sticks and Stones: The Role of Law in the Dynamics of Hate David Kader Sticks and stones will break my bones But words will never harm me. So goes the famous English language children's rhyme of uncertain origins; though apparently first appears in print in the second half of the nineteenth century, with variations (for example, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”). In either formulation, the teaching is clear, namely that children are to develop the proverbial “thick skin” to insults, taunts, and, if you will, to “turn the other cheek.” The rhyme is not descriptive, but prescriptive. It is aspirational. This attitude, in my view, is not the cause of but the expression of something unique to the American story in both our culture and our law: That expression is to be tolerated no matter how vile, and that certainly there ought to be no physical retaliation by the individual. That posture of toleration is to be seen not just in the subject of the words, but in the community at large through civic action—in laws, for example. We know, however, that words do harm and can hurt—and that is not only (though especially so) to those subject to hateful words, but also to those that hurl such language at another. Both victim and victimizer recognize that words do harm, do hurt. Moreover, we also know that words can lead to action, in the speaker, in others. Hateful speech can produce hateful conduct. In short, the dynamics of hate is intimately involved with ideas and the expression of those ideas. In my contribution, then, I wish to sketch how the law relates to such dynamics, primarily in the United States, but with passing reference to comparative national and international developments elsewhere in the world. Laws on hate speech First a word about “sticks and stones” that may or do break bones. Such violence is, of course, subject to the criminal law and civil liability. Absent excuse or justification, causing physical harm to another is a crime and a tort. Of interest here is whether such conduct, if motivated by hate, ought to receive additional sanction, beyond the underlying wrongful behavior. The label commonly affixed to such behavior is hate crime—bias‐motivated criminal behavior. The bias can be related to any number of identities: from nationality and ethnicity to religion or sexual orientation. Where legislation exists that defines hate crimes, typically by imposing greater penalties for bias‐motivated conduct, they are to be understood as distinct from laws that might prohibit hate speech. What joins the debate between hate crimes and hate speech is they were both largely born out of World War II and the Holocaust. Numerous nations throughout Europe have hate crimes legislation, something that has come very slowly and piecemeal to the United States (given our federal system where criminal legislation is largely a matter of state law). Some such crimes, though, date from just after the Civil War, with the major federal legislation in this area adopted as part of the famous Civil Rights Act of 1968. Most states in the union now have some form of hate crime legislation. While there remains some debate over the appropriateness and even efficacy of hate crime legislation, the major debate—we might even call it a controversy—is related to hate speech prohibition or regulation. If it is true that hateful speech can hurt and harm an individual, despite the admonition in the children's rhyme that it will not or ought not, and that such expression can be the foundational element in the dynamic of hate that leads to acts of violence, ought it be the subject of the law as well? Even a cursory review of the legal landscape on this question in the United States and around the world reveals a remarkably distinct pattern. The United States has resisted prohibiting or seriously regulating hate speech, while other nations—mostly in Europe, but also elsewhere—to various degrees have legislation regarding hate speech. The same is true as to international law. The subject is vast and beyond the scope of these brief remarks—but I...",

      "title": "Being-on-the-Bench: An Existential Analysis of the Substitute in Sport",
      "abstract": "Abstract Being a substitute in sport appears to contradict the rationale behind being involved in that sport, especially in those sports where substitutes frequently remain unused or are brought on to the field of play for the final moments of that game. For the coach or manager, substitutes function as a way to improve the team achieving a particular end, namely to win the game; whether to replace an injured or tired player, to change a team's structure or tactics, to complete a specialised manoeuvre (such as goal kicking in American football or a short corner in hockey), or to run down the clock. Whether a substitute is afforded an opportunity of playing the game appears to be directed by others; arguably if one had a choice in the matter one would chose to be on the field of play rather than off it. Nevertheless, the Existentialist position is that our situation is always inexorably one that is freely chosen. To argue that one has not freely chosen one's position is to be 'inauthentic'. Furthermore, to conceptualise one's manifestation and to be treated by others as a thing 'in-itself'–such as a substitute – is to fall into 'bad faith'. Culbertson (2005 Culbertson, L. 2005. The paradox of bad faith and elite competitive sport. Journal of Philosophy of Sport, 32: 65–86. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) has already argued that elite competitive sport is an arena that promotes rather than avoids bad faith due to its constituent factors. Culbertson's frame of reference primarily applied to sporting events that involve individuals competing in co-active, parallel competition – such as athletics, swimming or weightlifting – where bad faith is generated via a tacit acceptance of ever-improving and quantifiable performance. The purpose of this paper is a continuation of such an enquiry but with a redirection of focus away from parallel competition by individuals towards team competitions which are, by nature, less concerned with an unremitting contest against time, distance or some other measurable concept. This paper sets out to examine the nature of the substitute in sport, who appears to be equally liable to find herself being 'inauthentic' and/or in 'bad faith'. It attempts to consider the nature of these concepts and offer direction as to how substitutes can attempt to realise the Existential ideal. Resumen Ser un suplente en el deporte parece contradecir el fundamento mismo de estar involucrado con tal deporte, especialmente en aquellos deportes donde los suplentes se quedan en el banquillo a menudo o son sacados al campo de juego durante los momentos finales del partido. Para el entrenador o mánager, los suplentes funcionan como un medio para mejorar el rendimiento del equipo a la hora de conseguir un objetivo determinado, esto es ganar el partido; bien sea sustituyendo a un jugador lesionado o cansado, para cambiar la estructura o la táctica, para completar una maniobra especializada (por ejemplo marcar un gol punteando en fútbol americano o un saque de esquina corto en hockey), o para dejar pasar el tiempo en los momentos finales. Parece ser que si se le da a un suplente la oportunidad de jugar en un partido, esto depende de otros. Podría decirse que si uno tuviera elección en el asunto, preferiría estar en el campo de juego en vez de afuera. Sin embargo, la posición existencialista es que nuestra situación siempre es inexorablemente una que ha sido elegida libremente. Sostener que uno no ha escogido libremente su situación es ser \"inauténtico\". Además, el conceptualizar la manifestación de uno mismo y el ser tratado por los demás como una \"cosa-en-sí-misma\"—tal como es un suplente—es el pecar de \"mala fe\". Culbertson (1) ya ha sostenido que el deporte competitivo de élite es una área que promueve más que evita la mala fe debido a sus elementos constituyentes propios. El esquema de referencia de Culbertson se refería mayormente a eventos deportivos que involucran individuos que compiten en competiciones paralelas y coactivas, tales como el atletismo, la natación, o la halterofilia, donde la mala fe se genera por medio de una aprobación tácita del siempre mejorable y cuantificable rendimiento deportivo. El propósito de este artículo es continuar tal cuestión, mas dirigiendo el enfoque en vez de hacia la competición paralela de individuos, hacia la competición por equipos, al estar éstos, por naturaleza, menos preocupados por la incesante competición contra el reloj, la distancia, o algún otro concepto medible. Este artículo quiere examinar la naturaleza de la suplente en el deporte, quien parece ser puede encontrarse tan fácilemente siendo \"inauténtica\" como culpable de \"mala fe\". Intenta considerar la naturaleza de estos conceptos y ofrecer una dirección de cómo los suplentes pueden intentar realizar el ideal existencial. Zusammenfassung Ein Auswechselspieler zu sein scheint der Idee des Sports zu widersprechen, insbesondere in Sportarten, in denen Auswechselspieler gar nicht oder erst zum Ende hin ins Spiel kommen. Aus Sicht des Trainers oder des Managers erfüllen Auswechselspieler den Zweck, die Mannschaft zu verbessern, um bestimmte Ziele zu erreichen, das heißt, ein Spiel zu gewinnen; sei es einen verletzten oder müden Spieler zu ersetzen, sei es um die Aufstellung zu verändern oder aus taktischen Gründen, um einen speziellen Spielzug auszuführen (wie beispielsweise der Torschuss im American Football oder die kurze Ecke im Hockey), oder um auf Zeit zu spielen. Ob dem Auswechselspieler die Gelegenheit gegeben wird zu spielen, scheint von anderen entschieden zu werden; hätte ein Spieler die Wahl, würde er sich wohl dafür entscheiden zu spielen, anstatt auf der Bank zu sitzen. Wie dem auch sei, aus existenzialistischer Sicht beruht unsere Situation immer auf einer freien und unumgänglichen Entscheidung. Zu behaupten, jemand habe seine eigene Situation nicht frei gewählt, ist gleichbedeutend mit der Aussage, jemand sei ,nicht authentisch'. Des Weiteren ist es ein Rückfall in die Unwahrhaftigkeit, den eigenen Willen sprachlich zu fassen, sich jedoch von anderen als Ding ,an sich' – als Auswechselspieler – behandeln zu lassen. Culbertson (1) hat bereits argumentiert, dass Wettkampfsport auf Hochleistungsniveau aufgrund seiner ihn konstituierenden Faktoren ein Feld ist, das derartige Unwahrhaftigkeiten eher befördert denn vermeidet. Culbertsons primärer Bezugspunkt sind Sportereignisse mit Individuen in co-agierenden, parallelen Wettkämpfen – wie zum Beispiel Leichtathletik, Schwimmen oder Gewichtheben – wo die Unwahrhaftigkeit durch die stillschweigende Akzeptanz des konstanten Verbesserungsimperativs und der Quantifizierbarkeit der Leistungen entsteht. Ziel dieses Aufsatzes ist eine Fortführung der Fragerichtung, allerdings mit einer Neuausrichtung des Fokus weg von Parallel-Wettkämpfen von Individuen hin zu Mannschafts-Wettkämpfen. Letztere sind von Natur aus weniger interessiert an einem unablässigen Wettlauf gegen die Zeit, Distanzen oder anderen messbaren Konzepten. Dieser Artikel beabsichtigt, die Natur des Auswechselspielers im Sport zu beleuchten, der scheinbar gleichermaßen für sein uneigentliches und/oder unwahrhaftiges Sein verantwortlich gemacht wird. Dieser Text versucht, den Kern dieser Konzepte zu erschließen und zeigt gleichzeitig einen Weg auf, wie Auswechselspieler das existenzialistische Ideal verwirklichen können. Keywords: existentialismauthenticitybad faithsubstitutesport Acknowledgements The author would like to thank the two anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions and comments on an earlier draft of this paper. Notes 1. Heidegger (1977) uses the term 'Bestand' to describe the human tendency to view the world as something to be divided into representations of objects to be used and consumed for human purpose. It is this 'technological attitude' that conceals from humans their own being and prevents them from being authentic. 2. The term 'team' sport corresponds to sports that involve more than two players. Doubles events in racquet sports, for example, do not allow for the substitution of an individual in a pair either before or during a competition. 3. Indeed, there were complaints by the Australians during the 2005 Ashes Test that England's use of their substitute ran against the 'spirit' of the game. See Martin Gough, 'Substitute row mars Ashes series', BBC Sport website, 28 Aug. 2005, available online at http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4192306.stm, accessed 26 Dec. 2006. 4. Being authentic is holding the attitude that I engage in my projects as my own. One is inauthentic if one acts in such a way from a sense of duty (because it is what 'good' people or 'upstanding' citizens do), whereas, acknowledging that one freely chooses to act in a particular way (not because it is what one is expected to do) is to be authentic. Authenticity involves a transparency, in an acceptance that we, as humans, are beings who are wholly responsible for ourselves. In this, it could be argued that authenticity is a moral category, in promoting integrity and a recognition of the human condition. 5. As indicated earlier, this is the only thing one can say about a human essence or nature. 6. In this then, falling into bad faith and being authentic are not necessarily dependently related concepts. We may be in good faith while being authentic and we may be in good faith while being inauthentic, and contrary, we may be in bad faith while being inauthentic or in bad faith while being authentic. One does not necessarily presuppose the other. However, in certain situations there may be a relationship between the two, in that being inauthentic implicitly encourages falling into bad faith brought about by a pre-reflective attempt to be an 'in-itself'. 7. As given by Sartre in Existentialism and Humanism (1973). 8. As given by Sartre in Being and Nothingness (1958). 9. This idea is explored most fully in Sartre's play No Exit or Huis Clos (1944) and is exemplified in his famous phrase 'ell is other people'. 10. Heidegger expressed this 'Être-pour-autrui' or being-for-others. 11. There are occasions when these emotions are different – when being named in the squad is a source of pride and confidence (for example, if it is the first time one wears one's national shirt). Yet this merely emphasises Sartre's claim that one is in bad faith in sincerely playing the role of a substitute as an object in-itself. 12. In this mantra, Sartre emphasises that in being free, we carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. It is only as a result of our existence that there is a world for us to be confronted with and through this confrontation we are left with a freedom whereby we create ourselves; it therefore makes no sense to complain that the world is the way it is. 13. This could be her most skilful, mentally tenacious or physically dominant players; depending on what the coach believed to be important attributes or characteristics that would lead to the desired state of affairs in the game (i.e. winning). 14. Indeed, Sartre argued that it is with one's death that one's facticity – or one's purpose – becomes ultimately determined by others and not by oneself. 15. As noted by Camus in The Myth of Sisyphus. 16. This suggests a similarity to Wittgenstein's notion of 'attitude' in ethics. In a sense, the facts are irrelevant; one could always argue that our behaviour is highly influenced, determined even, by our genes or other physical or social causes but the point is that we hold the 'attitude' that we are free. This gives us credibility in being human: it is to take responsibility for one's being. To be authentic involves a sense of autonomy: to be resolute in committing to a course of action, rather than to merely occupy a role or place.",

      "abstract": "The capability of the human organism to work or exercise comprises of several components of physical performance capacity: endurance, power, force production, velocity, flexibility and co-ordination. Working in cold environments where it is possible that the temperature of the body, either superficial or core, decrease, the above mentioned components may be altered. In general, cooling decreases the ability of these components to function. The amount of decrease is dependent for example on: exercise type, exercise duration and degree of cooling. The exercises that seem to be most susceptible to cooling are those which are very short lasting and dynamic, utilising fast movement velocities and/or elastic properties of the working muscles. The decrease in core temperature, however is not a prerequisite for the decrease in performance. Already a very superficial cooling is sufficient to substantially decrease performance. Several mechanisms may be responsible for the decreased capacity of performance and they can severely suffocate the capacity to work in cold environments. Due to this an increase in individual strain and also the risk to have an accident are increased. Therefore, while working in cold environments cooling, especially of the working muscles, has to be avoided as efficiently as possible.",

Whether this emission is involuntary (known in rabbinic literature as qeri, i.e. accidental), or voluntary (in sexual intercourse), it causes the man a one-day uncleanness. He must immerse himself in the ritual pool, and await evening for full purification. In this case, Scripture does not prescribe a washing of clothes, and the rabbis take this to be the norm in cases of one-day uncleanness, the more serious genital dischargers being an exception. Further, any person or vessel that touches the man who has had an emission of semen remains pure. Food, whether solid or liquid, holy or profane, does become unclean if touched by him. While he is awaiting final purification (between his immersion and the evening) he can pollute only holy food, and causes no impurity to ordinary food by his touch. In this condition (known as tebul yom), he must avoid touching holy food, but may touch or eat ordinary food even if he is a member of a purity society (haber), sworn to eat even ordinary food ‘in purity’ (see Appendix A).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Our earthly benefactors (parents and the state) have the right to impose suffering on their beneficiaries, subject to two restrictions- the suffering does not outweigh actual benefits received and reasonably expected, and the suffering is the only way in which the benefactor can make possible some comparable good. One great good which humans have is libertarian free will to benefit or harm others, and thereby form our own character. In allowing humans to cause or suffer horrendous evils, God gives us the great good of having the opportunity to make ourselves saints or become totally evil. If we do not have this opportunity in our earthly life, it is compatible with Orthodox views of the afterlife, and with the Roman Catholic view, given an amended doctrine of Purgatory, that we shall have this opportunity after our death.",

      "abstract": "A person who experiences life as depleted of meaning will most often have little energy, show little motivation for acting, lack libido and love, and have little interest in the outer world. Of interest to researchers is that this person can have what seems to be a perfectly normal health, both mentally and physically. The loss of meaning of life is a hidden killer; it is like a worm eating the apple from within. A total loss of meaning always signifies a major life crisis or even a life coming soon to its end, but most often meaning of life is only partially lost. This partial loss is really much more tricky than a total loss because people set up mental defenses that hinder them from noticing the loss. After a while, the lack of meaning of life will be materialized in poor quality of life, mental and somatic symptoms, including depression or pain, and reduced ability to function sexually, socially, and in work. When carefully examined in the holistic clinic, most patients evidence a problem with their meaning of life; so, in this area much work can be done, greatly benefiting the patients.",

      "abstract": "On the assumption that the ability to overcome the effects of interference between the physical properties of an object is a basic component in the acquisition of conservation, we hypothesized that children would tend to negate conservation not only when the form of an object is altered but also when, without deforming the object, one of its properties (e.g., color or temperature) is altered; when variations (e.g., movement or orientation) are introduced into the concrete situation in which weight is exerted; or when other spatial properties (e.g., volume or surface) are made to interact with weight. The results indicate that children up to 8 years of age may have difficulty accepting the conservation of weight even when a transformation does not deform the object and that children up to 13 years may accept the conservation of weight but may find it difficult to explain why an object appears heavier in those instances where weight has to be coordinated with another spatial property. The theoretical implications of these results are discussed.",

      "title": "Getting a grip on different materials",
      "abstract": "A precision grip of index finger and thumb is often used to interact with objects in our environment. To successfully accomplish this everyday task we adapt our grip depending on various extrinsic and intrinsic properties of the object to be grasped. For example, the grasping movement needs to be adjusted if we want to grasp a wooden spoon or a wet bar of soap to provide a stable grip without the object rotating or falling. This adjustment not only depends on object features like shape or size, but presumably also on the visually perceived material the object is made of. We let our participants grasp cylinders of the same size (height: 10 cm, diameter: 2.5 cm) but different materials, i.e. foam, wood and brass as well as an additional brass cylinder covered with vaseline to make it slippery. These stimuli laid on their long side at six different angles with respect to the participants (0°, i.e. horizontally, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150° rotated counterclockwise). The task was to grasp, lift and carry the target objects to a goal position and place them there. We found that timing of the movement towards and while holding the cylinders was influenced by its material properties. Reaction time, movement duration to the object, handling and transport duration were on average longer for the slippery cylinder covered with vaseline. Object orientation appeared to primarily affect spatial characteristics of the movement like position and orientation of the grasp axis. However, these spatial effects were modulated by the material of the target object. Taken together our results imply that the timing and positioning of the precision grip depends on the object's visually perceived material properties. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2014",

      "title": "Social Psychology and the Law",
      "abstract": "Virtually every aspect of legal rules and procedures relies on assumptions about human psychology — about how individuals think, feel, and make decisions. Economics focuses on how people behave and interact as economic agents; psychology also focuses on human behavior and interaction, with specific attention to the influence of social and mental processes. Sometimes the law implicitly or explicitly incorporates findings from psychological science. For example, the law of negligence accounts for some of the limitations of human judgment in hindsight (Rachlinski, 1998). Because the hindsight bias is part of folk wisdom, legal rules have responded accordingly, such as in patent law where non- obviousness is determined by reference to secondary considerations like commercial success to “guard against slipping into the use of hindsight” (Rachlinski, 1998). But sometimes folk wisdom misunderstands human behavior and decision- making processes. Thus, for example, most people deem it unthinkable that an innocent person would confess to a crime she did not commit, in the absence of physical torture. And when folk wisdom misses the mark, it is more likely that judges, legislators, and other legal actors will fail to account for what psychological science might tell us about the human behavior in question. As one pioneer of the field of law and psychology observed over a century ago, “[Jurists] go on thinking that their legal instinct and their common sense supplies them with all that is needed” (Münsterberg, 1908). This chapter examines some of the implicit psychological assumptions about human behavior embedded in legal rules and practices. We narrow our focus specifically to social psychology, which we define as the scientific study of the ways in which individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the real, implied, or imagined presence of others (Allport, 1924).",

An abnormal environment is one to which we are not optimally adapted but can accommodate through the development of coping strategies. These abnormal environments can be 'exceptional', e.g., polar base, space station, submarine, prison, intensive care unit, isolation ward etc.; 'extreme', marked by more intense environmental stimuli and a real or perceived lack of control over the situation, e.g., surviving at sea in a life-raft, harsh prison camp etc.; or 'tortuous', when specific environmental stimuli are used deliberately against a person in an attempt to undermine his will or resistance. The main factors in an abnormal environment are: psychological (isolation, sensory deprivation, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, temporal disorientation); psychophysiological (thermal, stress positions), and psychosocial (cultural humiliation, sexual degradation). Each single factor may not be considered tortuous, however, if deliberately structured into a systemic cluster may constitute torture under legal definition. The individual experience of extremis can be pathogenic or salutogenic and attempts are being made to capitalise on these positive experiences whilst ameliorating the more negative aspects of living in an abnormal environment.",

      "title": "Humans can visually judge grasp quality and refine their judgments through visual and haptic feedback",
      "abstract": "Abstract How humans visually select where to grasp objects is determined by the physical object properties (e.g., size, shape, weight), the degrees of freedom of the arm and hand, as well as the task to be performed. We recently demonstrated that human grasps are near-optimal with respect to a weighted combination of different cost functions that make grasps uncomfortable, unstable or impossible e.g., due to unnatural grasp apertures or large torques. Here, we ask whether humans can consciously access these rules. We test if humans can explicitly judge grasp quality derived from rules regarding grasp size, orientation, torque, and visibility. More specifically, we test if grasp quality can be inferred (i) by using motor imagery alone, (ii) from watching grasps executed by others, and (iii) through performing grasps, i.e. receiving visual, proprioceptive and haptic feedback. Stimuli were novel objects made of 10 cubes of brass and wood (side length 2.5 cm) in various configurations. On each object, one near-optimal and one sub-optimal grasp were selected based on one cost function (e.g. torque), while the other constraints (grasp size, orientation, and visibility) were kept approximately constant or counterbalanced. Participants were visually cued to the location of the selected grasps on each object and verbally reported which of the two grasps was best. Across three experiments, participants could either (i) passively view the static objects, (ii) passively view videos of other participants grasping the objects, or (iii) actively grasp the objects themselves. Our results show that participants could already judge grasp optimality from simply viewing the objects, but were significantly better in the video and grasping session. These findings suggest that humans can determine grasp quality even without performing the grasp—perhaps through motor imagery—and can further refine their understanding of how to correctly grasp an object through sensorimotor feedback but also by passively viewing others grasp objects.",

Maslow. Every one of humans after being protected by the law, he should be capable of enhancing such five principles .When one’s religionwas protected from intimidation and violence, protected to do all the given orders and to leave all the given prohibitions in his religion as what Syatibi asserted, thus, at the same time the human should need his five basic needs called physiological needs to be fulfilled, such as need of air or oxygen to breath, need for foods and water, sexual desire, and having break, etc. Again, all these basic needsmust be fulfilled. Otherwise if they do not happen, one’s belief should get a trouble, and his convenience would be threatened for his own obedience of his belief or of his religion. That is because he would convert to get busier in order to fulfill his own basic needs. When one could feel safe on the first level, he would rise to the upper level where his self and his soul are protected under safe and convenience as it was intended by Syatibi. Maslow also means that a person on this gratification level needs to be safe (safety need). A person is given a ptotection of the law to care himself and his soul from murder, intimidation as well as violence. Hence, that is what intended by Maslow: a human must have a safe sense including safe in his neighborhood, his family and hisself.",

      "title": "Relational goods and overcoming barriers to collective action",
      "abstract": "Relational goods contribute to understanding why people engage in collective action, notably including political participation, even though, as Olson showed, it would often be more rational for them to free-ride on the activity of others. Relational goods are neither public goods nor private goods but a third type of good. They must be jointly consumed with another person or persons (unlike private goods), but the identity of the other persons matters crucially (unlike the case for public goods). Relational goods can only exist by mutual agreement as part of a relationship with non-arbitrary others, in the context of an interaction. Friendship is a prototypical example. Relational goods can exist along a range of personal contact from direct, where individuals interact face to face, to indirect, where the interaction may be at a distance with a certain type of person. In the indirect case the relational good may frequently take the form of reinforcing a desired social identity. The distinction between “consumption” and “instrumental” goods applies, parallel with other usage. The consumption relational goods are produced independent of any consequences of the action or relationship, while the instrumental ones refl ect consequences, such as from an action that enhances the value of an identity. People who value relational goods may act collectively even if other net benefi ts of action are negative. Larger groups become more, not less, prone to collective activity. Relational goods provide a missing element to understand how the process of mobilization works at the individual level; leaders can infl uence people’s perceptions of what others are doing, of the value of a shared identity, and of the likelihood of success. Some limited empirical evidence is consistent with relational goods playing a role in enhancing collective action.",

The value of wudhu in health is to clean away areas of the body that are frequently exposed to things or things that are contaminated with droppings, viruses, or bacteria.

      "title": "The ethics of suicide",
      "abstract": "There are well established criteria for what constitutes a homicide and under what conditions it is permissible. Since suicide is etymologically and semantically similar to homicide, I argue that deploying the structure of a homicide taxonomy to classify and characterise suicides arrives at a more robust understanding of suicide than alternatives, one that is intuitively plausible, and has the pragmatic quality that it is compatible with clinical assessments of suicide and suicidal behaviour. I show that while suicide may not be the moral equivalent of killing another person, types of suicide can be differentiated according to the same criteria as homicides: intention, mental capacity, diminished responsibility, and foreseeability. Suicides can then be subclassified similarly to homicides according to type: self-murder, justifiable self-manslaughter, voluntary self-manslaughter, involuntary self-manslaughter, and accidental suicide. Some suicides have elements of both homicide and suicide, such as when someone contributes to or encourages a person’s suicide, or when someone kills others when she kills herself, such as a suicide bomber. My view entails that deaths caused by a sublimated death-wish may be a type of suicide, and someone’s behaviour may be suicidal by a matter of degree. \r\n\r\nTo determine whether an act of suicide is wrong, we must consider the sorts of reasons that people have to kill themselves. I argue that even if we consider that human beings have intrinsic value, it does not follow that all suicides are wrong. On Kant’s view, the maxims that underlie actions, rather than the actions themselves, are fundamental to moral assessment. I show that Kant’s overall moral framework supports subcategorising suicides similarly to homicides. I apply Kant’s distinction between duties to selves and duties to others to show that agents’ obligations pertaining to suicide are only weakly symmetrical to their obligations pertaining to homicide. Kant indicates that duties to oneself and duties to others are not exactly equivalent. We have a duty to respect others’ autonomy, and this means that we do not act upon them as we might do to ourselves, and duties to oneself are not enforceable where duties to others may be. Kant’s position supports the idea that even if a given suicide is wrong, others may not be permitted to forcibly prevent it, and that is not the case with some weakly symmetrical homicides. \r\n\r\nEven if we accept that suicide sometimes honours one’s intrinsic value, this may not give adequate weight to the impact that suicide has on others. I argue that role-related special obligations, such as those that parents have towards their children, have contractual elements that preclude permissible suicide. If someone has a role-related obligation to provide continuing care and support, then normally there are strong moral reasons against that person committing suicide. This understands roles as having normative parameters that consist of contractual, voluntarily acquired special obligations. I deploy the conceptual framework of contracts to provide guidance on cases of suicide with respect to role responsibilities. I propose that as we have established criteria for morally acceptable reasons for cancelling, voiding, or amending a contract, we can apply these to the roles to establish grounds for releasing a parent from his role-related and contractual obligations. A parent who is terminally ill, for example, or has other legally and morally compelling reasons for failing to fulfil her role-related contractual obligations, may permissibly kill herself, though she may nonetheless have obligations to her child to find another suitable parent. I argue that the factors that determine culpability for homicides are also relevant for establishing culpability in contractual role-related obligations.\r\n\r\nI argue that the conceptual framework of contracts also provides a moral basis for honouring advance decisions to refuse life-saving medical treatment, where a decision pertaining to one’s eventual death as a self-killing takes place over a significant time. This is so, even though metaphysically the moral distinction between killing oneself and killing another person, including a future self, may sometimes break down. I argue that in suicide the agent who kills must be the same agent who dies, or it is not a self-killing at all, but rather a homicide. Nevertheless, we have social and pragmatic reasons for ascribing persisting ‘personal identity,’ and for regarding a psychologically discontinuous self as the same ‘person’ who issued the advance decision, despite metaphysical complications. \r\n\r\nThe symmetry between homicides and suicides shows that there can be very good reasons for suicide, such as to defend others, or because we value what makes ourselves distinctive and our lives meaningful. Even when suicide is not permissible, it is often not blameworthy, given the extenuating circumstances underlying an agent’s suicide. While classifying suicides may not give comfort to loved ones any more than classifying a homicide as vehicular manslaughter would, it does show that there are many types of suicide, and not all suicides are selfish, senseless, or shameful.",

      "title": "Some Aspects of the Orcadian Time Structure in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Rhythmicity is a fundamental property of living matter: biological rhythms in man as well as in other organisms can be demonstrated at all levels of organization (population, group, individual, organ, tissue, cell and subcellular structure). From a macroscopic point of view a rhythm implies regular periodicity of data displayed as a function of time. With the help of computers and special programs, it is possible to obtain a microscopic characterization and quantification of rhythm. A biorhythm can be characterized by the statistical estimation of several parameters: the period, the acrophase, the amplitude, the mesor. Each of these parameters is expressed as a mean with its confidence limits for a degree of security of 95%. With reference to the period, rhythms can be analyzed as a spectrum with several spectral domains: circadian rhythms (with period of about 24 h) are the most carefully studied, but other rhythms exist such as ultradian rhythms (period < 20 h) or infradian rhythms (period > 28 h, e.g. circamensual, circannual...). The acrophase is the peak time of the sine function used to approximate the rhythm. The amplitude is equal to half of the total rhythmic variability. The mesor is the mean adjusted rhythm; it corresponds to the 24-hour mean when sampling is performed at equal intervals. Circadian rhythms in blood variables are now fairly well documented in young healthy adults. Reports dealing with circadian rhythms in elderly subjects are few for obvious reasons, including the difficulty of gathering a group of elderly subjects comparable in age and social synchronization and moreover, free of major liver, heart, kidney, bone or any other degenerative disease and, consequently, not requiring medication. Therefore, we have undertaken a comparative study of the circadian rhythms in a group of 7 young healthy medical students (mean age 24 years) and in 18 elderly persons, free of the aforementioned diseases (mean age 80 years; 6 elderly men, 6 elderly women, 6 elderly women and men suffering from senile dementia). All subjects, either young or aged, were synchronized with respect to meal timing, diurnal activity and nocturnal rest. Blood samples were drawn at fixed times, every 4 h, during a single continuous span of 24 h beginning at 07.45 h (circadian rhythm) and the sampling was renewed four times a year to gather data on the circannual variations. Several biochemical variables were assayed, including electrolytes, enzymes, hormones. From these studies, it appears that the parameters characteristic of the biological rhythm may be modified with aging. However, the modifications are different from one function or variable to another. Differences in acrophases, mesors and amplitudes could be demonstrated. For instance, the acrophase may be shifted in the elderly for magnesium, calcium, proteins or some steroids, or on the contrary, it may be remarkably steady, e.g. for adrenal steroids, melatonin. The administration as a function of time of drugs or agents used as a diagnostic tool allowed to ascertain the importance of the time structure in this field. Both validity and interpretation of such administration depend upon the timing of the agent administration in the 24-hour scale. Therefore, the temporal organization of the subjects undergoing such treatments should be taken into account. One may presume that in a near future this type of investigation on various biological variables may lead to an improvement of the desired drug effects. Thus, the important changes observed in total serum proteins in the young and the aged, as well as the differences in the localization of their peak troughs, depending on the group, must be taken into consideration with regard to the roles played by serum proteins, in particular in the binding of several molecules, including hormones and drugs.",

An early, contribution to stress research was made by Cannon (1932), who described the fight-or-flight response. Cannon described that when any threat is perceived by an organism (animal or human), the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine glands prepare the body to fight the threat or free from it. He also considered it potentially harmful in the long run, if an organism is not able to fight or free and experience prolonged stress and continuing physical arousal (Sapolsky, 1994).",

      "title": "Noms De Guerre: The Power of Naming in War and Conflict in Middle-Earth",
      "abstract": "I.R.R. Tolkien skillfully Deploys deep understanding of the mythic and psychological power of names and naming throughout his legendarium. Among other aspects of naming, his stories highlight many ways in which names, naming, re-naming, and un-naming can be used as strategies in war and conflict. Names are, in one sense, the outward indication of power negotiation. The namer, the one who bestows new name or uses an already-given name, reveals, through the choice of name they use, their relationship to that which they name. It may be more or less equal relationship; may be one of exerting power over someone or something by imposing name on or by using name that will influence those who hear it; or may be one of subordination, using name to flatter or placate someone or something more powerful. A name may be used in magical sense, as form of logizomai--that is, naming something as that which you desire to be or become--or to give something greater power by distinguishing from others of its kind. A person may rename him- or herself--out of desire for anonymity, to indicate an alliance with someone or something else, or out of pride or hubris. (1) Here I wish to examine several examples of how names and naming are used in these ways in war and conflict in Tolkien's legendarium: weapons that are named, noms de guerre that are chosen by or given to individuals, new names adopted for variety of reasons, and names that are taken away. The use of naming as magical power in war ultimately leads us to Sauron's great and magical act of naming. NAMED WEAPONS Why might be named? Not all cultures have tradition of naming weapons. The Iliad describes the appearance, weight, symbolism, and lineage of Achilles's shield and spear at obsessive length without naming them; neither is Odysseus's bow, the one that proves his identity, named in The Odyssey (Grindley 151-53). But in the Northern and medieval literature with which Tolkien was personally and professionally engaged, named swords abound: Sigurd's Gram, (2) Beowulf's Naegling and Hrunting, Arthur's Excalibur, Roland's Durendal, Charlemagne's Joieuse, and so on. (3) With name, gains its own identity, even personality of sorts (Poudrier 35); name also marks as an heirloom tying generations together and legitimizing the heir who holds it. A named may be further distinguished by runes and inscriptions of power enhancing the abilities of the warrior who bears it (Burdge and Burke 703), ensuring victory or protection and further ennobling its bearer (Bribois 94), or bringing luck in battle (Davidson 67); the name itself may endow [the bearer] with [...] special powers (Bliss 77). In story, the hero's particular provides a concentrated symbolic functionality (Grindley 151), even more so if named, and the hero and his are inextricably linked (Flieger 147). Literary sword names often emphasiz[e] their power to do harm [and] to test the opponent [...]. [T]hey show imaginative personification of the weapon (Davidson 102). (4) Of the named weapons in Tolkien's writings, the vast majority are swords; the sword, as Ewart Oakeshott argues, possesses a potent mystique which sets above any other man-made object (qtd. in Whetter and McDonald 5). (5) There are only few singular examples of other types of named weapons. Aeglos (6) was the spear of Gil-galad, broken when he fell in combat against Sauron. Belthronding, borne by Beleg, is the only named bow, and Dailir its particular special arrow. (Bard did use his Black Arrow in combat against Smaug, and the Red Arrow was token of the agreement of Rohan to aid Gondor in war if needed, but those are not names on the same level; they fall somewhere between names and simple descriptors.) Dramborleg was the great axe favored by Tuor in battle; Durin's Axe is special heirloom weapon, but as with the Black and Red Arrows, the name is not true name like Dramborleg. …",

The problem of evil, of apparent divine neglect, is far more serious than many Christians acknowledge. The chapter considers some of the classic responses and rejects them as inadequate. If God were to set aside the laws of nature even once to reduce suffering, then God would incur a responsibility to intervene in most or all cases of suffering. Does that imply that God is simply cut off from exercising any influence on the world? No; an important new position on the nature of mind, “strong emergence,” allows for divine influence on human (and perhaps other) agents without the breaking of natural laws.",

      "title": "USING GENERAL SEMANTICS TO MANAGE 'EMOTIONS'",
      "abstract": "AS KORZYBSKI SUGGESTED do when analyzing a term, my first step in addressing the title topic was to consult a dictionary for definitions of emotion. (1) From Webster's 9th Collegiate (1987): Emotion: 1 a: obs: DISTURBANCE b: EXCITEMENT a: Affective aspect of consciousness; b: a state of c: psychic and physical reaction (as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as strong and physiologically involving changes that prepare the body for immediate vigorous action. Okay, how is affective defined? Affect: the conscious subjective aspect of an considered apart from bodily changes. And feeling as most directly related to emotion? 2 a: an emotional state or reaction b pl: susceptibility to impression Under syn find: FEELING denotes any partly mental, partly physical response marked by pleasure, pain, attraction, or repulsion.... My conclusions: old terminology, such as the term emotion itself and its concomitant definitions, exposes an elementalistic muddle. (2) Also, as evidenced in the going around in circles aspect of the above definitions, seem to be have reached the unspeakable level of undefined terms. Somehow know what we're intending to say, but can't quite say it. In Science and Sanity, I found relatively few indexed uses of emotion. On page 23, pointing out how to apply non-elementalism (3) when considering psycho-logical reactions, Korzybski advised that we must ... deliberately ascribe 'emotional' factors to any 'intellectual' manifestation, and 'intellectual' factors to any 'emotional' occurrence. On page 26, recognizing levels of abstracting, he noted Empirically, there is a difference between an 'emotion' which becomes 'rationalized' and 'emotions' invoked or produced by 'ideas.' On page 481: Through wrong evaluation ['is' of identity] are using the lower [thalamic] center too much and cannot 'think' properly. are 'over-emotional'; get easily confused, worried, terrorized, or discouraged; or else become absolutists, dogmatists. Again on page 481, noting the unspeakable aspect I mentioned above: We teach silence on the objective level in general, which is a most impressive 'emotional' education So, in considering Using General Semantics to Manage 'Emotions,' had best not get too concerned with any definition of emotion, lest our discussion become confusing and dogmatic. Rather, let's flag emotion as problematic by using the extensional safety device of single quotes: 'emotion.' Also the extensional hyphen, as in thoughts-feelings and intellect-emotion. Further, can replace these terms with the non-elementalistic term evaluation, which includes sensations-feelings-thoughts-behavior-environment, etc.; in other words, an organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment evaluational reaction (e.r.). (4) So, for me, our topic here is better phrased as Using General Semantics to Manage Evaluations. And what does managing evaluations refer to? I favor the phrase, effective self-management, the details of which are unique for each individual. For our purposes here, I suggest such goals as maintaining a relatively even keel when facing life's vicissitudes; maintaining meaningful relationships; contributing in positive ways to the larger community; having one or more deep interests to which time and effort is directed (could be work and/or hobbies, family, pets, etc.)--the details to be determined person-by-person. How to use general semantics to manage evaluations? Apply general semantics principles and techniques moment-to-moment! Study; consult the structural differential you have hanging on a wall (ahem); practice, practice, practice; etc., and again. Below you will find some examples of how you can do such applying and practicing; ways that I have found helpful both for my psychotherapy clients and myself. Recognize that any evaluation involves multiple causes associated with multiple effects, associated with multiple causes, etc. …",

      "title": "Induction and early learning",
      "abstract": "Some authorities believe that a child ordinarily attains one-half of his ultimate mental stature by the age of three years (1, p. 467; 8). Whether or not we agree with this estimate, probably none of us will deny that during the early years an individual acquires many habits and learns much about the world in which he must eventually live as a mature and relatively independent adult. Initial habits often appear in the form of conditioned responses: Albert soon becomes afraid of a rabbit (the conditioned stimulus) if each time it appears the experimenter makes a loud noise, an unconditioned stimulus which elicits the unconditioned response, fear (9). A host of aversions, affinities, and other attitudes have similar unremembered foundations which finally necessitate elaborate justification and hence often give rise to rationalizations whereby the belief holder offers ingenious good reasons to camouflage the real reasons of which he may be unaware.1 Even the best-intentioned and wisest parents cannot wholly eliminate undesirable conditioning. If Baby bites down on the spoon and hurts his gums the first time Mother feeds him Pablum, extinction of cereal-refusal may become a major project in that family for several days. Indeed, most adults attempt to conceal some quirks-such as fear of the dark, cockroaches, or mice-which embarrass and mystify them. How few of our food dislikes have strong physiological bases! Fortunately, man is not entirely a slave to conditioned reactions. The mechanistic picture once exhibited in all its robot-like rigidity by eminent psychologists2 has passed into the limbo of decadent art so far as most scientists are concerned. Socrates' exhortation to men to examine the bases for their beliefs is now seriously reiterated in circles where only recently the despondency of virtual predestin-",

      "title": "Regulación de la natalidad y violencia",
      "abstract": "Ours is a period marked by violence, and, most important, it is no stranger either to reproduction. In order to clarify concepts, by violence we mean, formally speaking, any interference or action by an external agent on a situation, structure, phenomenon or process with the object of nullifying it or of changing either its meaning (by deviation) or its intensity (by slowing it down or by accelerating it).\r\nIn this sense violence is not intrinsically illicit. One must distinguish between violence and violation . After a short study of the concepts of law, order and justice in the fundamental works of the principal Natural Law investigators of the present day, the author arrives at the conclusion that the genuine meaning of the term violation is any attempt against a principle of order, either directly of by undermining any of the other elements of order, be they real or related. \r\nThe human vocation of dominion over Nature, insofar as Man is a superior being, should not be thought of in absolute terms: it consists in being responsible for the conservation, reproduction, development and perfection of all creatures that tend towards their completeness according to individual ends which integrate themselves progressively towards one general goal. For this mission, which in general terms is called culture , man has a certain autonomy , but not full independence ; and the degree of autonomy is much more reduced with respect to his own species than in the case of inferior creatures. Man's capacity and his science can suffer deviations.\r\nInsofar as biology is concerned, these presentday deviations are serious and well known. The attempt against the physical and natural order, especially in the animal sphere, is widespread and threatens to obtain firm footing.\r\nIn this sense, we see that violence is being used, not in its lawful (and at times necessary) meaning of correction , of restoration of order, but as its violation .\r\nThe author has confined his examination of the problem to the question of human population: he discusses three fundamental aspects: prostitution of the biological culture, separation of erotic appetite and reproduction, conflict between individual rights and social interests .\r\nThe «scientific» attempts against the reproductive processes, including those previous to gametogenesis as well as the actual fertilization, are classified together under the heading of contraception . Both aspects are studied extensively and the author concludes that they are unlawful according to the Natural Law. The arguments of the proponents of contraception are studied and compared with those of their opponents, and special importance is given to biological and philosophical considerations; the conclusion is that no jurist with proper regard for legal considerations can accept theories that contradict authority and that can well be classified as setting precedents, especially when the matter is undergoing research.\r\nThe author examines the various present-day aspects of the «sexual revolution» as a key to explaining the many postulates and tendencies as well as the possible collision between individual rights and group interests.\r\nThe question of continence and Chastity are next examined. The discussion of human reproduction oscillates today between the two poles of «biological» and «scientific» arguments, with considerations regarding the meaning and limitations of these expressions and their consequences and applications. This is followed by a short analysis of the pragmatic attitude adopted by various politicians in their approach to these questions. After some short reflections on the limitations of human freedom implied by the present attitude towards the sexual revolution, the author makes a final conclusion in which he refers to self-control.",

Such manipulations—termed body disturbance (BD)—are generally designed to attract attention, underscore message content, and inject humor. Based on our lifetime of exposure to the human body’s appearance, properties, and capabilities, our schema is well established, and the disfiguring or distorting of the human body can elicit strong emotional and physiological reactions. This two-part study shows that BD functions similarly to other types of schema violations in terms of its attractive force, rendering such ads as more intriguing, entertaining, and humorous, thus leading to greater eye fixation and elaboration. Yet unlike most schema violations in advertising, BD ads evoke more aversive reactions compared to non-BD ads, resulting in lower ad and brand liking and offering no advantage in terms of greater recall of ad copy, brand logo, brand name, or product type. Further results and implications for advertisers are discussed.",

Although the existence of human cannibalism has been vigorously debated in recent times, it seems clear that well-described cases have occurred. The motivation for consuming human tissues may be (1) nutritional, (2) ritual and (3) pathological. A case of alleged cannibalism involving one of the victims of the so-called Snowtown serial killings in South Australia, Australia, is reported with an analysis of the history and features of cannibalism. Forensic problems may occur in accurately identifying remains that have been cannibalized; however, if ritualistic, serial and/or sadistic homicides are encountered, cannibalism should be considered, particularly if body parts are missing.",

The roots of these self destructive choices seem to be found in the lack of clear definition of the initial process of separation and individualisation from the first part of the second year to the end of the third due to relational disturbance in the mother-child relationship in the symbiotic phase (beginning of the third month-end of the first year). One of the constants in the behavior of an addict that can be found in most self-destructive behaviors is the concept of one's body as an enemy. In order to maintain a connection to his archaic parental objects that allow him to protect an ideal self image, the addict denies the reality of his body. The extreme consequence of this can be found in the paradoxical and delirious decision to « die so as not to die ». There is a moment in the life of the addict in which a change from addiction as a search for pleasure turns into addiction as a game with death. The addict becomes convinced that it is worth while to risk death so as to live. In other words his behavior becomes very similar to the ordalic, where, challenging death, he repeatedly attacks his own security",

      "abstract": "The English term ‘exile’ and the romance languages’ ‘exil’, ‘esilio’, etc., all derive from the Latin word exilium. This Latin term, however, does not share the assumption of these modern terms that the individual who moves out of a community (the exul) does so involuntarily, and that in more cases than not this departure is required or sanctioned by the community’s authorities or legal system. Ancient Greek terminology also observes different boundaries. The verb φεύγω, ‘I go into exile’, also has the meaning ‘I flee’ and ‘I run away from’, and in both senses the group or individual who φεύγει may do so voluntarily or unwillingly, and the thing or person which prompts evasive or fugitive action need have no legal or authoritative backing. Hence, the ancient Greek discourse on exile cannot be considered in isolation from the similar discourses on other forms of displacement such as fleeing, migrating and engaging (less than willingly) in travel.1",

      "abstract": "There is a prevailing tendency to read the first five chapters of Nicomachean Ethics Book 3, and 3.i in particular, as though they were narrowly, and the latter exclusively, concerned with moral and legal responsibility. At least one unfortunate consequence of this is that the ouk hekousion/akousion distinction tends to be ignored or dismissed as unsatisfactory; another is that inadequate accounts are given of acting under necessity (ananke). In this paper I aim to redress the balance by emphasising what I maintain is another concern of Aristotle's 3.i namely what is involved in acting and feeling in character.' As the opening sentence of 3.i reminds us, our topic is excellence of character or virtue that is that we are students of and virtue is concerned with actions and feelings.2 Book 2 has made some general remarks about the ways in which this is so. We become virtuous by doing virtuous actions (2.i) or rather, by doing actions that are in accordance with virtue or which are called just or temperate (2.iv) and vicious by doing vicious ones. The actions that produce virtue and vice also constitute the sphere of their activity, i.e. virtuous people do virtuous actions and vicious people vicious ones (2.ii). The feelings of pleasure and pain that accompany people's actions should be taken as a sign of their dispositions and, quite generally, virtue is concerned with the feelings, viz. with pleasures and pains (2.iii). Virtue operates in the field of actions and feelings, and to each virtue there correspond two vices, from which we may derive the general idea that, given one person with a virtue and two other people",

It is a matter of experience that the sense of understanding other people's actions draws continually on familiar and subjective elements by which we attribute to others states of mind, desire, motive and purpose that we can recognise in ourselves, or feel we could. They help to make these other people's actions intelligible. We impute understanding of the purpose or feelings of the actors to them. It is often implicit and intrinsic in the verbs or words we use to describe human behaviour (e.g. ‘announce’, ‘give’, ‘feed’, ‘welcome’, ‘answer’, ‘punish’). This is generally so in the description of human behaviour, whatever the writer and his purpose – novelist, historian, anthropologist, journalist, psychologist or philosopher. Description and interpretation of human behaviour are often bound together. Wholly objective descriptions of human behaviour (and ‘pure’ descriptions of social actions a fortiori) are very hard to provide. We do not register human behaviour in a simple objective fashion but we continually seek to recognise and translate it as we perceive it into terms of understanding if we can. We do this without thinking in everyday life; many words we use to think or speak about human behaviour imply such understanding willy-nilly. But it is also a matter of everyday experience that we sometimes find other people's actions hard to understand. The effort of attempting to and failing makes by contrast the interpretative element, which is usually present but implicit, more explicit.",

      "abstract": "For humans, annoying noise is any sound that ‘‘disturbs, displeases, troubles, or irritates.’’ In humans, the experience of annoyance is a metric, obtained by self-reporting. In animals, however, biologists can only measure behavioral reactions or physiological events. Based on such measures, three classes of negative reactions to noise have been identified. The first is aversion caused by relatively automatic physical reactions, such as the startle. Unequivocal measures of aversion include learned avoidance, behavioral suppression, and irritability. The second can best be described as motivation to eliminate interference with function. Noise masking is an example of interference with function, and the response can be quantified by work animals are willing to do to overcome the masking noise. Finally, animals can become more defensive in the presence of noise. This change in psychological state is measured by increased levels of vigilance or arousal, increased activity, species-typical defensive behaviors, or attacks on the noise source. Although humans typically empathize most with the first reaction, aversion, interference with function or perpetual defensiveness have similar, if not greater, impact in the long-term. Predictions of impact on both humans and animals will improve with accurate measurements of these biologically meaningful responses to annoying noise.",

Most probably, “Right to Dignified Life” could be considered the most salient objective of Human Rights Principle. It is also a justified fact that the tragic misery of contemporary man has to do with obliteration of the same fundamental principle underpinning Human Rights. More importantly, it is not merely sufficient for a man to survive. Man requires self-dignity, voice and remedies for achieving happiness and welfare, otherwise he/she is nothing but a mere physical existence. The contemporary man that has undergone such huge amount of human tragedies and sufferings increasingly loses its control over its own body, work and movement, and many accede to the fact that the most obvious reason is human trafficking.",

In addition to providing punishment for real or imagined wrongdoing, remorse may function to preserve a relationship with the harmed Other, who is kept alive and intact as an internalized judge. As painful as the feelings of remorse are, they may be sought or clung to as a defense against having to give up the Other, who, via incorporative processes, may be unconsciously experienced as part of the self. Painful memories and affects may serve to ward off the feelings of abject emptiness that would otherwise be experienced, especially with persons whose sense of self is highly dependent on a stable relationship with an Other.

      "abstract": "When an algorithm harms someone—say by discriminating against her, exposing her personal data, or buying her stock using inside information—who should pay? If that harm is criminal, who deserves punishment? In ordinary cases, when A harms B, the first step in the liability analysis turns on what sort of thing A is. If A is a natural phenomenon, like a typhoon or mudslide, B pays, and no one is punished. If A is a person, then A might be liable for damages and sanction. The trouble with algorithms is that neither paradigm fits. Algorithms are trainable artifacts with “off” switches, not natural phenomena. They are not people either, as a matter of law or metaphysics.\r\n\r\nAn appealing way out of this dilemma would start by complicating the standard A-harms-B scenario. It would recognize that a third party, C, is usually lurking nearby when an algorithm causes harm, and that third party is a person (legal or natural). By holding third parties vicariously accountable for what their algorithms do, the law could promote efficient incentives for people who develop or deploy algorithms and secure just outcomes for victims.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is to find a model of vicarious liability that is up to the task. This chapter provides a set of criteria that any model of vicarious liability for algorithmic harms should satisfy: \r\n\r\n1. Identify which third party or parties will be liable\r\n2. Be robust enough to avoid gamesmanship\r\n3. Give efficient incentives to all parties involved\r\n4. Produce fair outcomes\r\n5. Have low barriers to implementation\r\n6. Promote programming values, like interpretability\r\n\r\nThough relatively few in number, the criteria are demanding. Most available models of vicarious liability fail them. Nonetheless, the chapter ends on an optimistic note. The shortcomings of the models considered below hold important lessons for uncovering a more promising alternative.",

Appeal, in turn, depends on tastes, which in contrast to goals and standards, tend to be unanalyzable, Hence, the Attraction emotions are the least cognitively complex of all emotions. Tastes are treated broadly and include attitudes and preferences, and the notion of an object is also broad, including anything that is evaluated qua object, meaning that even events or agents’ actions can be viewed as objects. Although issues pertaining to aesthetic judgment are raised, they are not the focus of Attraction emotions. The Attraction emotion identified depends on whether an object is evaluated as being appealing or unappealing and whether it is viewed as itself being capable of emotion. Crossing these dimensions leads to four emotion types: “Affection” and “Enmity” emotions, which pertain to emotion-capable (generally animate) objects, and “Appreciation” and “Distaste” emotions, which pertain to emotion-incapable (generally inanimate) objects.",

      "title": "Avoiding Attack",
      "abstract": "Abstract The book discusses the diversity of mechanisms by which prey can avoid or survive attacks by predators, both from ecological and evolutionary perspectives. There is a particular focus on sensory mechanisms by which prey can avoid being detected, avoid being identified, signal (perhaps sometimes dishonestly) to predators that they are defended or unpalatable. The book is divided into three sections. The first considers detection avoidance through, for example, background matching, disruptive patterning, countershading and counterillumination, or transparency and reflective silvering. The second section considers avoiding or surviving an attack if detection and identification by the predator has already taken place (i.e., secondary defences). The key mechanism of this section is aposematism: signals that warn the predator that a particular prey type is defended. One particularly interesting aspect of this is the sharing of the same signal by more than one defended species (the phenomenon of Mullerian mimicry). The final section considers deception of predators. This may involve an undefended prey mimicking a defended species (Batesian mimicry), or signals that deflect predator’s attention or signals that startle predators. The book provides the first comprehensive survey of adaptive coloration in a predator-prey context in thirty years.",

      "title": "Bagging in Textiles",
      "abstract": "Abstract Bagging is a three-dimensional residual deformation, seen in used garments, which causes a deterioration in the appearance of the garment. The places it is seen during wear are elbows, knees, pockets, hips, and heels. The common factor in all of these parts of garments is the force exerted on that area of the fabric from the moving parts of the body. When the fabric covering that part of the body feels this force for a long time and feels it repeatedly, the fabric deforms and starts to take the form the force is trying to give to it. The force coming from the human body is in the transverse direction to the fabric's plane and the deformation which occurs is spatial. This prolonged and repeated deformation causes the fabric to change its shape, and it usually takes a dome shape, like a part of a sphere, so it is a three dimensional complex deformation that is very different from the other kinds of deformation seen in textile materials.",

      "abstract": "Regret, like guilt and fear, seems in a fundamental respect different from such emotions as amusement and disgust. Whereas amusement presents itself as a response to some sui generis form of value, the funny, regret seems to concern something with which we're already deeply concerned, quite independently of our tendencies to regret. What we regret, paradigmatically, are our bad choices or actions: Our mistakes, in a word. That is not to say that we can only regret mistakes, or only acts we take to be mistaken; but this is clearly the standard case. In the sense of regret on which we will focus here, it involves reproaching oneself for a decision, and it functions to motivate the agent to try to undo the action if possible and to act differently next time. Though it makes sense to lament an unlucky outcome or a poor set of options, if one decided well then regret would be inapt (though not impossible) to feel. Regret seems to be about something even a rational but disaffected alien, who was immune to regret, would care about: roughly, making bad decisions. By contrast, such an alien would have no interest, except perhaps anthropological interest, in the funny or the disgusting. Call this concern for mistakes the intentional aspect of regret.",

Is a king simply the man with the most power in society? ('A dog's obeyed in office' [IV vi 160–1].) Or is he a special kind of man whose authority derives from some innate distinction?

      "abstract": "Disease is as old as mankind itself. Man has always tried to understand natural phenomena and attempted to give his own explanation to it. According to Ayurveda, disease is a state of the body and mind that gives pain and discomfort to us. The cause of disturbance of the normal balance between the mind and body can be external, Agantuka, or internal, Nija. It means that the internal environment of the body is at constant interaction with the outside world. Disorder occurs when these two are out of balance. Hence to change the internal environment, to bring it at balance with the external world, it is important to understand the process of disease occurrence within the mind and body state. Ayurveda provides extensive insight into the concept and process of disease. According to Ayurveda, the root cause of any disease is always the imbalance of tridoshas, or body humours which further manifests as imbalance in other body components inevitably leading to diseases. Three main causes are misuse of intellect (pragyapradha), misuse of senses (Asatmendriyartha samyoga), seasonal variations (parinama or kala). Key words: Ayurveda, Roga, tridosha, trividha roga ayatana, pragyapradh, asatmendriyartha samyog, parinama.",

      "abstract": "Evacuation remains one of the main public protection strategies in response to a man-made or natural incident when people are at risk. In most cases when an evacuation is required, it indicates the presence of danger and urgency. By instinct, people affected act to escape from the danger; thus, two typical phenomena often occur during an evacuation: competitive behavior and herding behavior (Festinger, 1954). If people perceive a threat and are trapped at an incident site, they try to get out as soon as possible. Usually, they look for exit signs or evacuation routes that can lead them to a safer place and proceed to the nearest one. For people near the exit or route entrance, moving toward the exit or entering the evacuation route may be the only likely escape choice. Thus, two forms of competitive behavior may exist simultaneously: the effort to pass through the exit (or enter the route) as quickly as possible, and the effort among those at risk to run toward the exits. Such behavior may cause congestion at the exits or entrance points, even to the point that people may crush one another. The India stampede event on January 26, 2005, is just such a tragedy. According to media reports (BBC, 2005; CNN, 2005), a screaming crowd fled down narrow walkways chaotically when fires broke out, causing many people to be crushed and resulting in 250 deaths.",

Biblical and rabbinic texts reveal that the essential consideration in assessing a person’s humility is not that person’s relative assertiveness or timidity but rather with how much he or she subjugates personal self-interest to higher purposes. As articulated within the Jewish tradition of self-development called Mussar, humility inheres in directing one’s will toward sensitive service of the needs and wants of others within one’s social sphere as well as in line with one’s allegiance to the divine. Virtuous humility expresses itself in everyday contexts in the measure of the “space” (be that in the physical, emotional, verbal, financial, or another realm) that a person occupies. The ideal is to take up just as much space as is necessary to fulfill one’s mission of service in his or her life, neither more nor less. Moses fits (as well as defines) this paradigm.",

In Sanskrit, the number three signifies both “plural” and “complete.” An example of this triad is that of the three human goals or purusharthas (also known as the triple path or trivarga) invoked by the Kamasutra: dharma, artha, and kama. In the last book of The Laws of Manu, Manu correlates these three human goals with the three qualities of matter, which are linked to three kinds of bodily action (good, bad, and neutral), three bases of action (the mind-and-heart, speech, and the body), the three times (past, present, and future), and the three species of rebirth (gods, humans, and animals). Many of the Vedic triads became quartets due to the Vedantic shift away from sacrifice and worldliness. The Indo-Europeans divided the world into three social classes: kings (who were also priests), warriors, and producers of fertility. This triad soon became a quartet within the text of the Rig Veda. Some new quartets in the Puranas never seem to have been triads.",

      "abstract": "In Life's Dominion Dworkin aims at defusing the controversy about abortion and euthanasia by redefining its terms. Basically it is not a dispute about the right to life, but about its value. Liberals should grant that human life has not only a personal, but also an intrinsic value; conservatives should accept the principle of toleration which requires to let people decide for themselves about matters of intrinsic value. Dworkin fails, however, to distinguish between two kinds of personal value: (1) the value of something to a person, when he actually or dispositionally desires it, or finds it pleasant; and (2) the value of something to a person, when it's objectively contributes to his well-being, as defined by reference to his personal point of view, whether or not he ever perceives it as so contributing. He also fails to distinguish between two meanings of the concept of 'intrinsic value': (3) ultimate, i.e. non-instrumental personal value of kind (2); (4) the impersonal value of something which is not good-for-anybody, but simply good, i.e. not a constituent of someone's well-being. Dworkin argues that the human fetus from conception onwards has a value, that it is not a personal value of kind (1), and therefore must be an intrinsic value. But the value of the life of the fetus is not a personal value of kind (2) either and therefore not an intrinsic value of kind (3): it is normally a constituent of the well-being of the pregnant woman, but that doesn't constitute its value, and it is not good 'for' the fetus itself in the relevant sense, because it doesn't have a personal point of view. If, however, the fetus' life is allowed to have an intrinsic value of kind (4), the conservative cannot be refuted by appeal to the principle of toleration, for this only concerns intrinsic value of kind (3). The liberal, indeed, should recognize that the fetus' life has a value, but it is neither a personal value (1) or (2), nor an impersonal value (4), but rather a relational value which gradually develops from some point substantially later than conception.",

      "title": "STRESS-REACTIVITY AND STRESS-RESISTANCE AND MENTAL HEALTH OF PERSONALITY",
      "abstract": "Human health, as a biopsychosocial phenomenon, substantially depends on the responsiveness of an organism under certain conditions of activity and existence. Regarding a human being, the following types of responsiveness have been determined: biological or species-level responsiveness; group or constitutional responsiveness; individual physiological responsiveness; individual pathological responsiveness; specific responsiveness; non-specific responsiveness. Stress as the general adaptation syndrome and non-specific responsiveness of an organism significantly affects the physical and mental health of a personality by dint of the fight-or-flight or escape mechanisms. Concurrently, the scope of reaction related to the fight or escape is used to characterize stress responsiveness, which is genetically determined and is strictly individual. Thus, the behavioral mechanism of fight or escape preeminently refers to a constituent of unconditioned-reflex and instinctive activities of the human organism. Furthermore, phylogenetic constituents of the fight or escape mechanism are essentially supplemented by ontogenetic experience, becoming firmly established at the level of conditioned-reflex and instrumental activities. As a result, the main adaptation mechanism of stress responsiveness or mechanism of fight or escape can be viewed as a unique functional combination of inherited and acquired responses (unconditioned-reflex and conditioned-reflex reactions), which will considerably determine somatic and psychic norms as well as pathology of an organism. In its turn, stress responsiveness is tightly connected with the stress resistance of an organism. Indeed, stress resistance is an individual capability of an organism to maintain normal working efficiency under the influence of a certain stressor. Stress resistance can be enhanced with the help of learning; the essence of this learning lies in the conscious control of the activities of particular organs and systems and the behavioral activity of an organism as a whole. In psychology, stress resistance serves as the basis for successful social cooperation of a personality, which is predominantly characterized by emotional stability, as well as a low level of anxiety. Hence, stress resistance as a constituent of mental health in systemic relations with stress responsiveness contributes to the stability of homeostasis indicators with the involvement of morphological and functional reserves of an organism. In general, it is expedient to emphasize the following forms of stress responsiveness – low stress responsiveness (hypo stress responsiveness), adequate stress responsiveness (normal stress responsiveness), and increased stress responsiveness (hyper stress responsiveness). At the same time, there is a probable negative influence of both decreased and increased stress responsiveness on the constituents of mental health of a personality. In a holistic way, stress responsiveness and stress resistance of an organism significantly depend on the particularities of the central nervous system and autonomic nervous system, as well as the specifics of temperament in the corresponding systemic relations. In this respect, the two most important aspects of temperament, such as activity and emotionality (including anxiety) are distinguished. The diagnostics of stress resistance in the functional connection with stress responsiveness, along with morphological and functional reserves of an organism can include the following levels: 1) morphological level; 2) physiological level; 3) hematological level; 4) biochemical level; 5) immunological level; 6) level of the emotional sphere; 7) level of the cognitive sphere; 8) behavioral level. Psychophysiological particularities of active leisure and cognitive-behavioral therapy are aimed at the strengthening of stress resistance of an organism, as well as preservation of mental health of a personality under the corresponding conditions of activity and existence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It seems that God does, for the following reasons: The Apostle says in Rom. 1:28: “God delivered them up to a depraved way of thinking, so that they do unrighteous things.” And a gloss of Augustine on this text says: “God is evidently active in the hearts of human beings by inclining their wills to whatever he willed, whether to good or to evil.” But the inclination of the will to evil is sin. Therefore, God causes sin. People have said that the will’s inclination to evil is attributed to God insofar as such inclination is a punishment, and that is why Augustine in the cited text speaks of the judgment of God. But the same thing cannot in the same respect be a punishment and a moral wrong, since punishment is by its nature contrary to the will, and moral wrong is by its nature voluntary, as I have said before. And the will’s inclination belongs to the nature of voluntariness. Therefore, if God inclines the will to evil, it seems that he himself also causes moral wrong as such.",

The provoking behavior was generally portrayed by the perpetrator as meaningful and comprehensible, whereas the victim tended to depict it as arbitrary, gratuitous, or incomprehensible. Victim accounts portrayed the incident in a long-term context that carried lasting implications, especially of continuing harm, loss, and grievance. Perpetrator accounts tended to cast the incident as a closed, isolated incident that did not have lasting implications. Several findings fit a hypothesis that interpersonal conflicts may arise when a victim initially stifles anger and then finally responds to an accumulated series of provocations, whereas the perpetrator perceives only the single incident and regards the angry response as an unjustified overreaction.

      "abstract": "To possess the virtue of honesty or kindness, it is not enough to act sometimes in honest or kind ways. Virtues, like character traits in general, are standing properties of agents that explain their actions. Over the past decade or so, philosophers have debated whether the findings of experimental social psychology undermine the traditional confidence that people do indeed possess such dispositions. This debate has supposed that dispositions are states that generate a particular kind of output from a particular kind of input. The fragility of a vase, on this view, is the disposition to shatter when struck with a certain amount of force. Likewise, the virtue of compassion is, or includes, a disposition to respond to other people's suffering, or the prospect of it, with actions, or at least thoughts and feelings, that tend towards alleviating or averting that suffering. The disagreement has concerned whether people really can develop dispositions to respond appropriately to such a stimulus irrespective of the fine details of the context in which that stimulus occurs (see Miller, this volume, Chapter 37). However, there are many virtues and other character traits that are not properly understood in terms of stimulus and response. The virtues of constancy, fidelity and integrity form one cluster of such traits. These traits may be displayed in behaviour in difficult circumstances, but what seems essential to them is not the way in which one responds to any particular kind of situation.",

Such social evaluation is not limited to humans. We previously showed that dogs avoided a person who behaved negatively to their owner (Chijiiwa et al., 2015). Here, we explored whether domestic cats, another common companion animal, similarly evaluate humans based on third-party interactions. We used the same procedure that we used with dogs: cats watched as their owner first tried unsuccessfully to open a transparent container to take out an object, and then requested help from a person sitting nearby. In the Helper condition, this second person (helper) helped the owner to open the container, whereas in the Non-Helper condition the actor refused to help, turning away instead. A third, passive (neutral) person sat on the other side of the owner in both conditions. After the interaction, the actor and the neutral person each offered a piece of food to the cat, and we recorded which person the cat took food from. Cats completed four trials and showed neither a preference for the helper nor avoidance of the non-helper. We consider that cats might not possess the same social evaluation abilities as dogs, at least in this situation, because unlike the latter, they have not been selected to cooperate with humans. However, further work on cats’ social evaluation capacities needs to consider ecological validity, notably with regard to the species’ sociality.",

      "title": "Reparations after species extinctions: An account of reparative interspecies justice",
      "abstract": "The \"standard\" story of reparative justice goes something like this: an individual or a group of individuals (an agent, a community, etc.) has been the subject of injustices. These can be understood as human rights abuses, persecution, misrecognition, discrimination, distributive injustices embodied in the theft of cultural goods or natural resources, and so on. These injustices can then in turn be addressed by mechanisms that may include reparatory, restitutive, or restorative justice. Particularly historic injustices targeting communities are commonly described as appropriate objects of state reparations, such as widely discussed in the context of colonialism and slavery. Against the background of currently high levels of human-induced biodiversity loss, the question that now poses itself is whether a similar (albeit in many respects quite different) story can be told about anthropogenic species extinctions. In light of human-caused extinctions, can (some) humans or human institutions like the state be approached with reparative claims to respond to those losses? One place to start this inquiry would be to take inspiration from the environmental ethics literature, which already offers different accounts of moral repair (Almassi, 2017) or restitution (Basl, 2010) and links these to practices of ecological restoration as moral restitution and/or reparation.1 Such arguments could plausibly be extended to the subject matter of species extinctions. Yet, in this paper, we aim to show that species extinctions can also be integrated within a non-anthropocentric account of reparative justice that is significantly similar to how reparation is understood within the political theory literature and, thus, linking concerns of environmental ethics to political philosophy. That is, in how far are species extinctions a matter of reparative interspecies justice that is owed to individual nonhuman beings? And consequently, which entities are owed reparation and what would this reparative duty entail? That is a novel area of inquiry. Yet, we do not have to fully start from scratch, because several political, environmental, and animal philosophers have already articulated different non-anthropocentric theories of (distributive, capabilities, recognition, etc.) interspecies justice on which such an account of reparative justice can be built (e.g., for book-length renditions, see Baxter, 2005; Cochrane, 2018; Donaldson & Kymlicka, 2011; Garner, 2013; Low & Gleeson, 1998; Nussbaum, 2023; Schlosberg, 2007; Wienhues, 2020. More on this literature and our understanding of interspecies justice in Section 2.1). Against this background, reparative justice within the context of interspecies justice has not received much philosophical attention to date (apart from Welchman, 2021),2 and a full account of reparative interspecies justice has yet been proposed. In what follows, we propose an initial (and, thus, incomplete) account of reparative interspecies justice specifically for the case of human-caused species extinctions. For that purpose, we narrow our scope in two ways. First, we investigate species extinctions as a concern of reparative interspecies justice. Since the early 1990s, anthropogenic climate change has permeated the practice of much of environmental, legal, social, and political philosophy. This dedication, however, contrasts with the attention given in the discipline to another equally serious and morally problematic consequence of human actions, namely, anthropogenic species extinctions; a predicament that, like climate change, is closely connected to social, economic, and political struggles, and an existential threat to continued life on the planet.3 Second, reparative duties can be plausibly built on a range of different theories of justice. In this paper, we only outline, as an example, how a responsibility to repair results from collective distributive interspecies injustices implicated in species extinctions, such as the loss of habitat, and related transitive wrongs. It is nonhuman individual beings which are subjected to these injustices. Thus, by taking a non-anthropocentric perspective on distributive justice as a starting point, which conceptualizes extinctions as the outcome of injustices as opposed to constituting injustices themselves, we address the question of whether we can make sense of a duty to repair following species extinctions. That is distinct from (but potentially compatible with) two further justice-based lines of argumentation with respect to extinctions. That is, first, additional non-anthropocentric arguments that claim that extinctions themselves are injustices (e.g., by attribution justice claims to collectives like species or ecosystems). A second additional line of argumentation is more apparent anthropocentric justice-based arguments on this issue that consider species extinctions as a problem of our duties toward future human generations (e.g., Feinberg, 1974). Defending an extinction-specific reparative duty owed to nonhuman beings entails, first, elaborating on the relationship between extinctions and interspecies injustice that provides, in turn, the groundwork for enquiring whether, second, demands of reparative interspecies justice follow, once a species has gone extinct. Because theories defending the first step have already been elaborated (e.g., Wienhues, 2020), the second step is the focus of this paper. This topic is theoretically interesting insofar as anthropogenic species extinctions can lead to counterintuitive consequences—a form of moral hazard. After all, if we do not owe anything to nonhuman beings in terms of justice once they do not exist anymore, then failing to prevent extinctions would be \"rewarded\" by reduced duties of interspecies justice in the long run—if no reparative duties would follow. Moreover, this topic is also of practical relevance because our suggested account provides some general guidelines about how a state and its institutions should act in response to past injustices that led to species extinctions. This paper is organized as follows. The second section offers a brief introduction to anthropogenic species extinctions, underlining specific characteristics of this phenomenon that are especially relevant to our argument. Moreover, we also explain our starting premises with respect to interspecies justice. Thereafter, in the third section, we develop our argument about the reparatory demands that result from extinction-related injustices. Based on the premise that the state and international institutions more broadly should be the vehicle of enacting that responsibility to repair (as opposed to restoration or restitution), we will argue in the fourth section that responsibilities to repair to the nonhuman dead can be met with symbolic forms of reparation. These reparations both honor the life of the victims of past injustices that contributed to their species' extinction and benefit other still-living nonhuman beings through a commitment to interspecies justice. That makes our view on reparations both retrospective and prospective and, thus, reparations can take different forms. That includes, for example, the preservation or restoration of habitat to materially repair the interspecies justice relationship in itself. As we will argue, this form of repair is the core of reparative action, which is supplemented with symbolic acts and educational programs, such as monuments and natural history museums to honor the nonhuman dead. As part of ongoing evolutionary processes, species extinctions are an inherent part of life on Earth. However, not all extinctions are morally equal and some clarifications are in order to explain more precisely what phenomenon our argument addresses. To underline our interest in the link between species extinctions and interspecies injustices, we advance four qualifications concerning the type of extinctions that are relevant to our present purposes. First, we are not interested in \"background extinctions\"—an ordinary form of extinction event—but in anthropogenic species extinctions. This anthropogenic origin conceptually differentiates the current mass extinction event from previous mass extinctions (Aitken, 1998). Relevant activities driving extinctions include practices of deforestation, indiscriminate use of pesticides, and widespread pollution, amongst other drivers. These human activities, taken collectively, have transformed nearly all of the Earth's surface and thereby have reduced and are in the process of reducing \"natural\" biodiversity even further (see IPBES, 2019). Thus, our focus is on the current mass extinction process, driven by human impacts on the environment, that some scientists have argued marks the end of the Holocene and that is predicted to be the sixth extinction event on such a large scale (Ceballos et al., 2015; Wake & Vredenburg, 2008).4 Applying this massness requirement to human-caused extinctions (in combination with the structural requirement mentioned below), in turn, lowers the epistemic burden for proving the anthropogenic causation of each individual species extinction.5 Second, we are interested in final extinctions of wild species. Final extinctions can be differentiated from other extinction processes that do not lead to the end of the respective phyletic branch.6 For example, our concern here lies with species like the Dryopteris ascensionis and not the Coregonus fera. This is the case because no individual member of the D. ascensionis—a plant from Ascension Island in the Atlantic—exists anymore (its extinction is final), while the Coregonus—a fish once common in Lake Geneva—exists in a hybridized form as the Coregonus palaea. Having said that, while the creation of a new daughter species is not covered by our argument, localized and near (final) extinctions are included. Yet, in terms of possible reparatory actions, such cases go beyond the different forms of reparation discussed in Section 4. Additionally, we focus on the extinction of species such as the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) and not on the extinctions of domesticated varieties such as the tautersheep. While the former is an extinct \"wild\" marsupial from Australia, New Guinea, and the islands of Tasmania, the latter is an extinct breed of domesticated sheep from Norway (part of Ovis aries). One aspect that differentiates these two cases is the conceptual difference between the loss of species and the loss of specific breeds. However, our main reasoning behind this distinction is that the relevant community of interspecies justice in our following argumentation is limited to \"wild\" nonhuman beings. That does not mean that domesticated nonhuman beings are not within the scope of justice (they might be), but their relationship with humans will ground different principles of justice than what justice might demand towards more or less \"wild\" nonhuman beings.7 While there is certainly concern not only about \"wild\" species but also old grain and vegetable varieties being lost, the debate about the current mass extinction event primarily concentrates on \"wild\" species or the loss of \"natural\" biodiversity. That is what people worried about the current mass extinction event as a moral problem usually imply and that is what we will focus on as well, setting all moral matters related to domestication aside. Third, the term \"human activities\" is meant to refer to the general anthropogenic source of those planetary transformations and should not obscure the fact that, first, not all humans are implicated to the same degree (or at all) in the activities that contribute to species extinctions and, second, that these activities should not be primarily understood as individual choices but rather as practices that are part of broader collective economic and social processes and developments, such as industrialization. In other words, anthropogenic species extinctions, which are part of the current mass extinction event, are caused by larger economic processes and structures in which individuals are collectively implicated and which contribute to the drivers of extinction such as land-use change leading to the destruction of habitat (e.g., by the conversion to agricultural fields and a changing climate). In combination with the magnitude of the phenomenon (involving domino effects), this structural origin of anthropogenic species extinctions indicates that those practices may not only impact upon members of one species but rather on members of multiple species simultaneously.8 As a final and fourth clarification, we should note that this focus on extinctions driven by collective human endeavors does not exhaust all relevant aspects of the wrong implicated in anthropocentric species extinctions. Accordingly, this paper rather provides a further explanatory story of why extinctions are morally problematic in addition to other individualist or species-based arguments that explain the moral wrongness or badness involved in anthropogenic species extinction.9 For one, even within the individualist interspecies justice framework in which our argument is operating, there is space to consider whether other kinds of wrongs and injustices are implicated in species extinctions that go beyond drivers of extinction perpetuated by human collective practices and complementary reparative claims. Second, while our aim is to provide an individualist argument for the injustices implicated in extinctions, this is compatible with (yet does not necessitate) a range of claims that see other moral wrongs or losses situated on the species level. For example, nothing in our argument precludes maintaining that the loss of a species involves the loss of intrinsic, instrumental and/or relational value.10 However, because the non-instrumental value of species is contested (see Sandler, 2012), an additional individualistic argument for the wrong implicated in species extinctions is particularly valuable for the environmental literature. In addition to outlining our understanding of extinctions, we need to add three additional clarifications about interspecies justice and its relationship to extinctions that function as premises for our argument about reparations in the following sections. First, the term \"interspecies justice\" (or alternatively \"ecological justice\"; on \"multispecies justice\" see endnote 12) is not employed consistently in the environmental political theory literature, or the environmental studies literature at large. By interspecies justice we denominate a non-anthropocentric body of work about justice which is complementary, but not identical, to intra-human accounts of environmental justice (salient examples being Baxter, 2005; Cochrane, 2018; Low & Gleeson, 1998; Wienhues, 2020). This also includes works that use other terminology, such as \"animal justice\" (see Donaldson & Kymlicka, 2011; Garner, 2013; Nussbaum, 2023). What all these works share is that they attribute rights or entitlements of justice to (some) nonhuman beings as individuals, analogous to intra-human accounts of justice in political thought. Thus, in line with the tradition of liberal theorizing and as our first premise, we endorse a loosely individualistic account of interspecies justice as a form of normative evaluation of relationships between individuals that occur between humans qua moral agents and other morally considerable individuals, that is, individuals who have a good of their own or well-being.11 Of course, these different accounts differ in many respects, such as concerning their position on moral considerability; with some theories being sentientist while others taking a biocentric perspective.12 Our argumentation in the following sections remains agnostic about this question about moral standing, being compatible with both types of individualistic positions on moral considerability. As authors of this article, we take diverging views on this matter. In previous publications, we have respectively argued for sentientist (Donoso, 2019, 2021, 2023) and biocentric (Wienhues, 2020) approaches to justice. Yet, our argument about reparations is compatible with both our positions. In other words, the proposed account should be understood as a \"reparative add-on\" that can plausibly build onto different starting theories of interspecies justice. Based on this set up, there are at least two ways in which species extinctions are implicated in interspecies injustices. First, and as our second premise, species extinctions can be an outcome of distributive injustice (see Wienhues, 2020). For example, if nonhuman beings (on either sentientist or biocentric accounts) are entitled to use an adequate amount of environmental goods and spaces (e.g., access to adequate habitat) to satisfy their morally relevant needs and interests under an account of distributive interspecies justice, then serious infringements on these needs and interests can (and often do) cumulatively lead to the extinction of their respective species. So, species extinctions without constituting injustices in themselves function as indicators for past distributive injustices, such as when driven by loss of access to habitat. Land-use change, in turn, is credited as the main driver of species extinctions. There are many examples for this phenomenon. For instance, it has been hypothesized that the extinction of the Taudactylus diurnus—the Australian Mount Glorious Torrent Frog—was driven by deforestation in its habitat (Ruiz, 2020). Second, those past injustices can also impact on other classes of individuals whose existence is entangled with the lives of those who were subjected to injustice in the first place. That is our third premise. These are transitive wrongs that may have a domino effect (see Strona & Bradshaw, 2018), so that actions leading to the disappearance of a species X may wrong not only members of X but also members of another coexistent species Y. Furthermore, distributive injustices that lead to species extinctions may extend over time, so we can identify interconnected injustices and their outcomes at different times. For example, the wrongful impact of actions leading to the extinction of X at t1 may be long-lasting, so that at t2 members of Y continue to be affected by the previous extinction of X. Then, over time, the consequences of the past injustices that originally wronged members of X are also felt by members for Y and may also have a negative impact on species Z and so on. In brief, anthropogenic species extinctions can indicate the existence of past distributive injustices—some of which may have lasting effects on other species—against individual members of different species. It should be clear that this conceptualization of extinctions has considerable normative consequences. Since injustices are the kinds of wrongs that come with a stringent obligation to respond to them, and while individual moral agents can rarely satisfy these obligations on their own due to the structural and collective nature of the original injustice, the following two central questions follow: who (if anyone) should act in response to species extinctions and what form should the response to the injustices entailed in species extinctions take? Concerning the former question, we take it as given that extinctions can be made relevant for state reparations, analogous to reparatory claims in the intra-human context. As the state is generally better positioned than other institutions or individuals to respond to structural and collective-action problems, this gives support to the idea that the state should be the main addressee of these reparatory claims. Indeed, as elaborated above, the types of species extinctions that we are interested in here are the result of such structural practices and collective-action problems. This state-focused premise requires, of course, more elaboration and defense.13 Setting this area of inquiry aside, we rather address the second of these two questions in the next section. If anthropogenic extinctions occur and these are outcomes of injustices, then it is important to reflect on what would constitute an appropriate moral response to these past injustices. As said, injustices are the kind of moral wrongs that are usually understood as resulting in an obligation to be addressed. So, what would be an appropriate response if not only the wronged individuals are gone but also their entire species has gone extinct? In the following we are aiming to illustrate the plausibility of framing this response in terms of a responsibility to repair. That is, we take reparations to be the right (but not necessarily sole) response to past injustices that resulted in species extinctions. To further specify, distributive injustices (such as the loss of habitat) and the respective transitive wrongs can be implicated in three different kinds of extinctions—final, local and near extinctions—which in turn allow for different kinds of reparative actions (Figure 1). Because local and near extinctions often ultimately amount to final extinctions, and because final extinctions are also the most difficult case for making sense of possible reparative duties, we primarily focus on this latter possibility.14 Emphasizing reparations (as reparative justice)15 in the context of final extinctions rather than other classes of responses to injustice—such as restoration or restitution (as in restorative justice)—has substantive benefits. Significantly, it allows for a wider class of actions to respond to past injustices than, for example, acts of restoration or restitution that more closely rely on the possibility of reinstating past conditions which might not be obtainable any more—particularly in the case of the extinction of one or several species.16 In contrast, although reparative actions also allow for the retrospective material restitution of the past, they do not necessarily entail, nor can they be reduced to, this class of responses. Rather, they constitute acts with a broader set of purposes including also (i) the reparation of a lost balance, (ii) the recognition of transgressed values, or (iii) the commitment not to repeat past injustices, which all include prospective elements.17 Each of these purposes is relevant for the specific wrong that concerns us here. To further specify the benefits of focusing on reparative justice, let us underline, as a way of contrast, some important differences between reparations, on the one hand, and restorative and restitutive justice for species extinctions, on the other. As a means of illustration, consider the specific case of de-extinction. Despite that this might sound like science fiction, serious efforts are underway to \"bring back\" several species, such as Mammuthus primigenius (the Woolly Mammoth) and Ectopistes migratorius (the Passenger Pigeon).18 Notwithstanding their name, the technological interventions grouped as de-extinction such as cloning are \"a set of techniques utilizing the remnants of extinct populations\" (Lean, 2020, 574 without original italics) and do not necessarily rely on actually resurrecting an extinct species (which concerns questions about its \"identity\").19 Thus, while this practice may seem to some a self-evident way to address past anthropogenic extinctions, it is by no means an obvious response to past interspecies injustices. Let us only mention three relevant considerations in this regard as a means of contrasting reparative and restorative justice. First, if de-extinction is supposed to function as a means of restorative justice (in the form of a duty to resurrect species), de-extinction needs to be understood literally as the restoration of species by \"reinstating\" extinct species (or a similar \"copy\") back into an ecosystem. While the possibility and conceptual necessity of this is a matter of debate (see Delord, 2014; Diehm, 2017; Lean, 2020), for our specific theoretical angle it is also relevant that those who were subjected to distributive injustices leading to species extinctions were individuals, not the species to which they belonged. This means that creating new members of an extinct species (or better, creating a similar new species) does not track the wrong committed against individuals in the past. These individuals cannot be brought back, which provides one reason for why de-extinction technologies are not an appropriate response as restoration for the injustices that contributed to species extinctions, because those new individuals are not adequately linked to the original injustices suffered by those in the past. Thus, if de-extinction is not an appropriate means of restorative justice in this context, then it is not obvious what other possibilities would be open to address interspecies injustice after extinctions as a matter of restoration. Second, in contrast to restorative justice, de-extinction might fare better as a form of reparative justice which does not rely as much on the material restitution of the past.20 Yet, an essentially experimental approach like de-extinction seems ill-fitted for reparation understood as (i) recuperating a lost balance in terms of the relationship between human and nonhuman beings by the means of employing ever more increasing control over nonhuman nature. That concern—in addition to the appropriate attitudes, such as humility towards nonhuman nature, that accompany our view on interspecies justice—provides another reason for being skeptical of de-extinction as a solution to interspecies injustices. Third, reparation as (ii) the recognition of transgressed values or as (iii) a commitment not to repeat past injustice also seem inappropriately addressed by providing a \"techno-fix\" solution that could in practice rationalize putting less effort into preventing interspecies injustices in the future. That constitutes a moral hazard, because it opens the potential to employ less care and attention towards our relationship with nonhuman beings, trivializing humans' commitment to adequate interspecies relationships.21 Consequently, de-extinction as an environmental management practice neither lends itself easily as a means of reparation nor restoration.22 Yet, our main aim for this example was to illustrate the differences between restoration and reparation in the context of species extinctions. The upshot being that the de-extinction case shows how a reparation perspective might be more flexible than a restoration lens with regards to the death of the relevant wronged entitlement holders within a justice framework and, thus, allows us more argumentative space in the context of final extinctions. However, once the concept of reparation is recognized as a salient notion for interspecies justice in the context of anthropogenic extinctions, we still need to, first, circumscribe the addressee of the duty to repair and, second, find an answer for how to fill the content of this duty. Beginning with the first issue, how can the state—or anyone for that matter—make right a past injustice when not only the direct victims of that injustice are dead, but their entire species has been wiped out? In other words, toward whom or what is the duty to repair directed? In contrast to typical cases of reparations in the human context where it has been argued that current generations can be owed reparations for injustices suffered by their ancestors under certain conditions (e.g., Butt, 2013; Herstein, 2008; Sher, 2005), a central issue is that arguments based on group claims (e.g., by the species) are not available in the case of final extinctions. Due to the extinction of the species in question, the extinct species cannot be the source of any group claims, even if one would want to extend the individualist perspective in this regard by arguing for species-based group claims.23 So, if duties directed to species do not argumentatively lead anywhere, maybe it is possible to owe something to the nonhuman dead. For the human case, some theorists have taken this argumentative angle seriously and concluded—not without some controversy24—that we do have obligations to the deceased as a result of obligations towards them that existed when the now deceased were alive.25 Michael Ridge, for example, has argued that even though the \"very idea of duties to the dead may seem bizarre to some, […] common sense recognizes such duties\" (Ridge, 2003, 42). He illustrates this by pointing to cases such as deathbed promises or tort law, where wrongful death statutes allow compensations for damages resulting from death itself (post-mortem damages) which, in turn, are measured by the loss to the dead's estate rather than to the dead's beneficiaries. More recently, Zofia Stemplowska has claimed that we do have duties to the dead and that these duties can impose the obligation to mitigate past injustices. She argued that \"justice should be concerned with the distribution of opportunities people have for the fulfilment of their preferences, including their preferences over outcomes that stretch beyond their well-being and biological lives\" (Stemplowska, 2020, 33). Because \"advancing or curtailing opportunities of preference fulfilment when a person is alive can mitigate (or exacerbate) injustice, it can also […] do so posthumously\" (Stemplowska, 2020, 36). If a case can be advanced in support of obligations to the human dead (we think that this is at least a plausible intuition), it is then conceivable to entertain the idea that a similar—while not identical—case might be offered in the nonhuman case. That is, in favor of an obligation to mitigate past injustices that the nonhuman dead were subjected to when alive. Since the central reasons for granting obligations owed to the dead do not depend on whether the deceased is a member of Homo Sapiens, there seems to be an initial basis for this claim. If genuine obligations are owed to nonhuman beings (as i",

I explore several problems involved in this approach (including the sometimes jarring inappropriateness of \"benefit\" terminology). I then offer an alternative account where the primary moral obligation toward companion animals is to develop, nurture, respect, and protect the loving relationship between them and their human companions, since thriving in such a relationship, I claim, has become part of their evolved telos (to use Bernard Rollin's term) or evolved nature. This priority naturally leads to ensuring welfare, but the highly pro-active approach involved takes the obligation beyond standard welfare provision and \"TLC\" (\"tender loving care\"). Some implications of this position are explored.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A computational model for artificial animals (animats) interacting with real or artificial ecosystems is presented. All animats use the same mechanisms for learning and decisionmaking. Each animat has its own set of needs and its own memory structure that undergoes continuous development and constitutes the basis for decision-making. The decision-making mechanism aims at keeping the needs of the animat as satisfied as possible for as long as possible. Reward and punishment are defined in terms of changes to the level of need satisfaction. The learning mechanisms are driven by prediction error relating to reward and punishment and are of two kinds: multi-objective local Q-learning and structural learning that alter the architecture of the memory structures by adding and removing nodes. The animat model has the following key properties: (1) autonomy: it operates in a fully automatic fashion, without any need for interaction with human engineers. In particular, it does not depend on human engineers to provide goals, tasks, or seed knowledge. Still, it can operate either with or without human interaction; (2) generality: it uses the same learning and decision-making mechanisms in all environments, e.g. desert environments and forest environments and for all animats, e.g. frog animats and bee animats; and (3) adequacy: it is able to learn basic forms of animal skills such as eating, drinking, locomotion, and navigation. Eight experiments are presented. The results obtained indicate that (i) dynamic memory structures are strictly more powerful than static; (ii) it is possible to use a fixed generic design to model basic cognitive processes of a wide range of animals and environments; and (iii) the animat framework enables a uniform and gradual approach to AGI, by successively taking on more challenging problems in the form of broader and more complex classes of environments",

      "abstract": "There are two overarching themes in this book. The first concerns order and how it was created in ships of the Royal Navy at the end of the long eighteenth century. The second theme explores how people shape their lives by engaging in a range of behaviour, at times outside the lines drawn by authority. This will be a different view of the Royal Navy than those offered by other historians who most often start with and return to the leader, the captain or admiral, the great or lesser man, as the driver of all shipboard activity, the determiner of mission or battle outcome. The shipboard world is cleaved into three parts in this study. The first concerns the range of ways in which order was established on a ship. Order refers to the state in which people adhere to the structure and rules created by authority which enables authority to accomplish the goals it sets. Order was established in a variety of ways and from different points within the organizational structure of the Royal Navy. It is established in a top-down process. Ordering systems often view acts which contradict established customs, regulations or laws as reflective of personal idiosyncrasy, an inborn or social class proclivity to err or stray from the good. The second element investigated is the ways in which people serving within the navy undermined that order. The resulting ‘disorder’ was most often viewed and responded to by the navy through the legal lens of the Articles of War, with the aforementioned frame of mind. But to the perpetrators this behaviour could be perceived as any number of things, including resistance, retaliation, disobedience, accessing a right, exercising choice, or simple filching for self-gain, among others. The term ‘disorder’ is employed throughout the book to indicate this range of possibilities. It is offered to push against the tendency to see the ‘disordering’ behaviour as crime, which leads to an explanation of failure within the perpetrator rather than seeing it as behaviour engaged in to shape aspects of the environment, to improve or change one's circumstances. This latter approach to ‘disorder’ portrays an additional source for determining activity aboard a ship beyond the officers, that is, the seamen and marine privates. It also allows for the perspective that officers themselves pressed against order to shape their own and their crews’ experience.",

Although most social scientists have an intuitive sense of what constitutes a riot, the edges of the definition are fuzzy and it can be difficult to determine whether or not some events are actually “riots.” For example, it is agreed that a riot is a collective act. That is, more than one individual must be involved and at least minimally coordinate action in order for a riot to occur. Two people acting together, however, would not constitute a riot, even though it is a collective act of violence. The lower limit for participation, damage, or duration, or a combination of the three, necessary to qualify an event as a riot is ambiguous and disputed, leading many scholars to analyze events called “civil disorders” or “collective violence.” For most, however, unless there are at least 30–50 people involved, the events last more than a few moments, and there is action that could result in property damage or injury requiring medical attention, a riot has not occurred.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the state of the Eternal of a person as a certain state of mental life. Attention is paid to the development of the characteristics of the Eternal state. The connection between the characteristics of the Eternal state of a person and salvation is shown. Such concepts as the state of the Eternal and salvation are substantiated. The content of the leading concepts of the problem is revealed. Generalized qualities of the very state of the Eternal of a person. The main focus is on the notion that the state of the Eternal is a compensatory insight that destroys all human motives. From destroyed motives, a person freezes and stops. This stop is for the good, because unimportant, not the main ones are destroyed; the motives that distract a person from the main thing, that tempts him or her, are destroyed. The attention is focused on the fact that in the state of the Eternal, a person stops and freezes without any desires or motivations. But when there is a threat to a person from the outside, the person starts to act. This happens because in the state of the Eternal, a person retains the urge to be saved. All other motivations are destroyed. Attention is paid to the fact that the motivation for salvation cannot be secondary and unimportant. This is also evidenced by religious and mystical culture in general. The problem of salvation is considered in Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. That is, we are talking about what is important in motives, and what is important in human desires. There is a connection with salvation issues. There is a state of trance, a state of ecstasy, a state of inspiration, a state of insight. But there is a state of the Eternal. In the holy scriptures (Vedas, Avesta, Tripitaka, Tao Te Ching, Torah, Bible, Koran), it is God. It is referred to in different ways (Nirvana, Samadhi, Satori). But this is the state of ETERNITY, in which all motives are violated, but the motive for salvation remains in the depths of the soul. Creativity destroys the obsolete. Destruction cleanses the brain of the obsolete. Destruction clears space for the new. In the moment of creativity, destruction gives rise to something new. A person shapes himself by looking at himself critically. Attention is paid to the fact that a person paves the way to higher states of consciousness. And self-critical awareness is vital. The state of the Eternal (Eternity) arises by chance. Documentary evidence suggests a name for this phenomenon. Documentary evidence speaks of «imperishability». The state of the Eternal comes to a person spontaneously and accidentally. Attention is paid to the fact that this is a compensation process. The state of the Eternal is a compensatory insight. But the focus is on compensating for weak will. A person destroys his/her desires. A person destroys his/her impulses. They are a nuisance. They prevent you from moving towards your goal. They are an obstacle on the way to the state of Eternity. The author considers the notion that self-criticism purifies. It is emphasised that self-criticism still activates the condition. Self-criticism is still stimulating. Attention is paid to the fact that self-criticism still stimulates the Eternal. The Eternal arises by chance. It arises spontaneously. The struggle stops in the human soul. A person masters himself/herself. The author considers the idea that people destroy what is unnecessary in themselves. They restrain their desires. They engage in self-criticism every day. It is emphasised that they do self-criticism every day. This is the reason for the state of Eternity. This is the reason for the emergence of the state of Eternity. But the state of Eternity arises by chance.",

As with demand, there may seem to be a problem in maintaining that it is possible for people to supply esteem in this way. After all, I cannot make a gift of my esteem, nor can I offer it in a trade with another person, nor can I pass on the esteem I receive from others. But while esteem itself may not be alienable in these ways, certain ‘esteem-services’ are: I can voluntarily offer you my attention, my testimony, and my company, and do so in a way that promises to increase your positive esteem. And I can do this without self-defeat so far as I can hide my motives or, more plausibly, can do so in a virtually but not actually strategic way: I give my attention, testimony or association quite spontaneously but will be led to think again if it fails to secure suitable reciprocation.",

We compute the angles subtended by three major components of the body with the vertical axis, namely the torso, the upper component of the leg and the lower component of the leg. Using these three angles as a feature vector we classify frames into breakpoint and non-breakpoint frames. Breakpoints indicate an action's commencement or termination. We use single action sequences for the training data set. The test sequences, on the other hand are continuous sequences of human activity that consist of three or more actions in succession. The system has been tested on continuous activity sequences containing actions such as walking, sitting down, standing up, bending, getting up, squatting and rising. It detects the breakpoints and classifies the actions between them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hatred Rage, effects of, on the system Uncovering of the teeth Rage in the insane Anger and indignation As expressed by the various races of man Sneering and defiance The uncovering of the canine tooth on one side of the face. If we have suffered or expect to suffer some willful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behavior, or by some ill temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremist peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, but until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

      "abstract": "God speakes about life in many ways. Some remarkable statements are included in the idea of man as image of God. The first one is that life comes from God and is his gift, his image, his mark. God is the only owner of life; therefore this is an unthinkable reality, which is removed from the power of any man. Traditional analyses of death and dying acknowledge, at least implicitly, that decisions about health care take place in the context of relationships, social interdependence, and social obligations. However, bioethics through the middle of the twentieth century still concentrated attention on individual decisions and guarantees of autonomy. Christian teaching has traditionally opposed active causation of death, even for suffering, terminally ill patients. At the same time, death need not be opposed absolutely. The death of a very elderly or ill person may be accepted as appropriate, and measures to prolong life may be refused. To determine the moral character of decisions to use or refuse means, the context must be examined. For one thing, a means that is virtually useless or very dangerous in one era of medical practice may improve in efficacy as time goes on. Similarly, what is not tolerable or effective for one patient may be reasonable and useful for another. Moreover, the patient considering the acceptance of death must sometimes take into account the common good, for which he or she may still have a responsibility.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRAK. Privasi adalah keinginan atau kecenderungan pada diri seseorang untuk tidak diganggu kesendiriannya. (Sarwono, 1992). Manusia adalah makhluk sosial yang perlu berinteraksi dengan makhluk lain untuk keberlangsungan hidupnya. Tetapi manusia sebagai individu juga memerlukan privasi atau mengatur jarak personalnya. Penelitian ini memfokuskan pada pengaturan privasi dengan melihat pada desain rumah sederhana. Desain rumah sederhana baik tipe 36 maupun 45 sebenarnya sudah mengupayakan pengaturan privasi. Namun karena keterbatasan luasan bangunan dan ruang, seringkali pengaturan privasi menjadi tidak efektif. Dalam perencanaan ruang dan zona, rumah sederhana sudah mengatur privasi. Akan tetapi karena kebutuhan ruang yang semakin berkembang maka pada rumah sederhana dibutuhkan perluasan ruang yang biasanya merupakan ruang publik. Begitupula halnya dengan pengaturan sirkulasi. Pengaturan privasi di dalam rumah diupayakan supaya jalur sirkulasi tidak terganggu atau mengganggu aktivitas. Selain itu jalur sirkulasi hendaknya tidak bisa digunakan untuk melihat secara langsung ke dalam aktivitas yang ada di dalam rumah. Elemen bangunan yang menunjukkan pengaturan privasi antara lain terwujud dengan pemagaran, pintu dan jendela. Pemagaran pada rumah ditujukan untuk membatasi privasi seluruh penghuni rumah. Keberadaan pintu terutama yang mempunyai dua buah pintu juga merupakan pengaturan privasi yang baik. Sehingga apabila ada tamu di dalam rumah maka penghuni rumah tidak akan merasa terganggu. Kata kunci: privasi, desain, rumah sederhana ABSTRACT. Privacy is a need or tendency of someone who does not want to be disturbed (Sarwono, 1992). Human is a social creature who need to interact with others to survive. Though human as an individual also need privacy as well by creating a personal distance with others. This research is focused on privacy setting by defining at a design of simple house. Design of simple house either 36 m2 or 45 m2 types, both are considering the setting of privacy needs. However, regarding to the limited building area and space, sometimes the setting of privacy is not effectively considered. In the process of planning in space and zones, simple house has setting the privacy need. However, the need of spaces has been regarded developed, this will affect space’s expansion of simple house which used to be a public space. This condition will affect the setting of circulation as well. The setting of privacy within house has been considered as an effective as possible though the circulation line will not disturb the activities within house. Furthermore, the circulation line should not been used as a direct view through the activities within house. Building elements which could show setting privacy, could be defined as follow: by using fencing, doors and windows. Fencing at house is intended to control the privacy of residents. The existence of doors particularly house with two doors could be considered as a good privacy setting. Thus, if there are visitors within the house, the residents will not be disturbed by their existence. Keywords: privacy, design, simple house",

      "title": "Second Digression (28b3–34b5)",
      "abstract": "After his refutation of Meletus, Socrates enters into a long digression on his way of life in which the principal themes are nobility and death, a natural pair. The digression begins with a question. Someone, he says, might perhaps ask, “Then aren't you ashamed, Socrates, of having followed the sort of pursuit from which you now run the risk of dying?” (28b3–5). In other words, even if you are innocent, isn't it shameful to have pursued a life that renders you unable to protect or defend yourself, that may in fact lead to your destruction (cf. 17c7–d1 with Xenophon, Memorabilia 4.8.4 and Oeconomicus 11.22–24)? This recalls the question, raised after Socrates' refutation of the charges of the first accusers, that launched his earlier digression. One of you, he said then, might ask: if you have done nothing unusual, or more unusual than “the others,” Socrates, why are you in so much trouble? (20c4–d1). That, he said, was a just question, and his answer, although perhaps playful, would be true. The answer took the form of a story about the Delphic oracle and the consequences of Socrates' efforts to confirm the nonexistence of superhuman wisdom. As Strauss observes, the second digression “continues, deepens, modifies the first” (“Apology,” 44). This time he says that his answer will be just – he is silent about whether it will also be true – but he characterizes the question itself as shameful.",

Satyagraha, to be genuine, be offered against parents, against one's wife or one's children, against rulers, against fellow-citizens, even against the whole world. Such a universal force necessarily makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe. The force to be so applied can never be physical. The only force of universal application can, therefore, be that of ahimsa or love. In other words it is soul force. Therefore, a satyagrahi, a civil resister will joyfully suffer even unto death. It follows, therefore, that a civil resister, whilst he will strain every nerve to compass the end of the existing rule, will do no intentional injury in thought, word or deed to the person of a single Englishman.",

      "abstract": "Jealous love and morbid jealousy, although inextricably linked, cannot be considered the same: jealous love (trait jealousy) is the behavioral and cognitive-affective precondition of morbid jealousy (state jealousy). Love is jealous when it is devoured by the desire for the exclusive and total possession of the partner, whose unconditional and continued presence is avidly requested. This type of love, in addition, is permeated by the need to know what the other is thinking, in order to scrutinize every minimal flaw in the faithfulness of the partner even in his or her innermost thoughts and fantasies; in it, jealousy is virtually always present, even in the absence of a triggering event, because captative love, by its very nature, includes the expectation of a conflict which inevitably actually takes place in reality. Finally, jealousy emerges as an emotional event (jealous flash) in response to a more or less significant change in the behavior of the partner, and reveals to the jealous individual a dimension which was previously latent or inexistent. This intense and brief experience, leaves a more or less blurred memory behind, and tends to progressively repeat itself and take root as a feeling.",

Although most social scientists have an intuitive sense of what constitutes a riot, the edges of the definition are fuzzy and it can be difficult to determine whether or not some events are actually “riots.” For example, it is agreed that a riot is a collective act. That is, more than one individual must be involved and at least minimally coordinate action in order for a riot to occur. Two people acting together, however, would not constitute a riot, even though it is a collective act of violence. Thus, the lower limit for participation, damage, and duration to define a riot is difficult to establish and has led many sociologists to analyze events more ambiguously referred to as “civil disorders” or “collective violence.” For most, however, unless there are at least 30–50 people involved, the events last more than a few moments, and there is action that could result in property damage or injury requiring medical attention, a riot has not occurred.",

      "abstract": "\"Why Didn't She Say Something Sooner?\"Doubt, Denial, Silencing, and the Epistemic Harms of the #MeToo Movement Heather Stewart (bio) \"It may be that the most debilitating postmemories … are those instilled by silence.\" (Susan J. Brison)1 \"Why didn't you say something Sooner?\" has become a familiar refrain—a question frequently leveled at those victims/survivors2 of sexual violation3 who delay their decisions to bring forward testimonies or reports of their experiences until sometime in the future, at times, long after the event(s) transpired. This question (\"why didn't you/she say something sooner?\") is not only a linguistic mechanism for casting doubt on the testimonies of particular victims in isolated situations (i.e., to the person the question is directed at), but, given the regularity with which this question is asked of victims/survivors, has also come to reflect broader, deep-seeded epistemic assumptions about members of particular identity groups (namely, women and especially queer women or women of colour) and their abilities to be credible givers of knowledge more generally. This question—and the epistemic assumptions loaded into it—contributes to the structural and systemic doubting of victims/survivors of sexual violation at both social and political levels. This pervasive doubting of victims/survivors contributes to various forms of epistemic injustice against them4 and, consequently, harms victims/survivors in a variety of ways. While the harms that victims/survivors often experience in the aftermath of sexual violation, and subsequently in deciding whether or not and when to report it, are many and varied—ranging from physical harms to their bodies, to psychological and emotional harms, and interpersonal or social harms—this paper seeks to highlight a distinct type of harm that victims/survivors too often experience when bringing forth (or withholding) testimony of sexual violation, namely, epistemic harm. The role of epistemic harm as a distinct and significant category of harm experienced by victims/survivors of sexual violation (particularly [End Page 68] during the current cultural and political rise of the #MeToo movement) has been undertheorized in the growing scholarly engagement with victims/survivor testimony in the #MeToo movement, and this paper intends to rectify this gap. In what follows, I argue that a particular category of harm—that which is characteristically epistemic in nature—is pervasive among those choosing whether, how, and when to bring forward testimony of sexual violation, particularly as part of a larger movement among victims/survivors, but nevertheless has not been sufficiently analyzed in scholarly examinations of the movement. Moreover, I argue that insofar as the uniquely epistemic harm that results from a variety of oppressive epistemic phenomena (namely, testimonial injustice, gaslighting, and testimonial smothering) are serious and enduring, the nature of this harm and its effects on victims/survivors are worth attending to in their own right. More precisely, I contend that an adequate understanding of the various harms experienced by victims/survivors of sexual violation demands an exploration of this particular category of harm. Doing so helps to elucidate a morally significant dimension of a rapidly growing movement. The paper will proceed as follows. In section I, I will contextualize the philosophical concept of epistemic injustice as it has developed in feminist and social epistemology literatures.5 I will then describe three distinct forms that epistemic injustice can take, all of which are prevalent in the era of the #MeToo movement. In section II, I will draw out the harms of the three types of epistemic injustice detailed in section I. Importantly, I will show how these harms are serious and enduring not only for those victims/survivors who experience them qua individuals, but also for victims/survivors as a group, whose credibility is collectively undermined as doubt pervades at social and political levels. This, I con-tend, also has important social and political consequences, particularly for shaping the backdrop in which these conversations are happening. With analyses of the epistemic phenomena and their related harms in hand, in section III, I examine one recent case, that of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony of sexual violation against then United States Supreme Court nominee (now United States Supreme Court Justice), Brett Kavanaugh.

      "abstract": "Adulteration is the wilful addition to an article of any substance or substances the presence of which is not acknowledged in the description under which the article is sold, or the abstraction from an article of an essential constituent without disclosing that it is impoverished. Some common synonyms are: corruption, defilement, debasement, vitiation and sophistication, all of which indicate the sinister nature of the act. Articles are adulterated to increase their weight or bulk, and to improve or change their appearance or flavour in imitation of an article of higher grade or different kind. In the limiting case it can be regarded as covering the complete substitution of one article for another. Wilful addition implies addition which could have been avoided and hence covers contamination brought about by lack of care. The term is used mainly in connexion with foods and drugs, but in practice extends to almost all manufactured products and is an almost inseparable accompaniment of trade competition. It will be observed that there are two requirements for adulteration, viz. an action and an intention. The mere act of mixing one thing with another does not, in itself, warrant the term adulteration. It must be coupled with an intention to deceive by passing off the mixed article as if it were unmixed. The intention is usually not apparent until some circumstance warrants the inference, such as the sale or exposure for sale of the article. The inclusion of such concepts as wilfulness and intention, which are much more difficult to prove than facts, introduces difficulties and prevents in practice the employment of a simple definition without provisions being made to protect the honest man from injustice. Accidental contamination or impurities unavoidably present, if not due to neglect or lack of reasonable care, are not normally regarded as adulteration unless the impurity is dangerous to health. In this country the only law which deals directly with adulteration is the Food and Drugs Act. The present Act, that of 1938, prohibits :—",

      "abstract": "In families, we can notice physical disorders in people living under the grip of the asymmetrical nature of narcissistic pervert links. The characteristic traits of these links are a degradation of one of the members of the link’s narcissistic integrity, together with a weakening of self-esteem, as a result of constant humiliations. The pervert’s victim suffers from fainting fits, allergic reactions, gastro-intestinal or vascular disorders, joints pain, somatizations or psychosomatic disorders with an anatomical starting point. The pervert can, in turn, develop physical disorders when he loses his superior stand and can’t express his distress, rant or hallucinate.The bond between the subjects of the link is weak or non -existent. There is a lack of mutual acknowledgement: the victim is not considered as a person by the pervert, he has no empathy towards the victim. The victim may even react with pleasure to belittlements thus encouraging him. The physical fits seem linked to the powerlessness to get rid of theses chains. The forces which look after self-protection are weakened. PFT and PCT cases will throw a light on these ideas.",

      "title": "Self-Immolation in Early Indian Buddhism",
      "abstract": "Self-immolation refers to ascetic Buddhist practices that include the voluntary termination of one’s life or the offering of parts of one’s body usually by setting oneself ablaze. In both the Northern (Mahāyāna) and Southern (Theravāda) Buddhist traditions, self-immolation has been considered a heroic bodhisattva act to end one’s life with a spiritual motivation and strong sense of determination. In modern times, self-immolation is often used as an extreme form of protest or an act of martyrdom. In early Indian Buddhism, self-immolation was not justifiable for the following reasons: First, self-immolation cuts short one’s opportunity to attain liberation before having made proper use of one’s life to its fullest potential. Second, self-immolation is a form of self-modification or severe asceticism because it causes extreme physical pain and may lead to death. Third, self-immolation is an act motivated by a craving for non-existence (vibhava-taṇhā) and is rooted in the “personality-view” (sakkāya-diṭṭhi) or “ego-view” (atta-diṭṭhi). Lastly, self-immolation goes against the concept of “self-love” (attā-piya) or “self-affection” (atta-kāma), which is considered a necessary prerequisite for expressing “loving-kindness” (mettā) toward other beings. Thus, I can safely say that self-immolation is not in keeping with the original teachings of the Buddha and that self-immolation cannot in any way be recognized as heroic or noble.",

      "abstract": "Humans have a propensity to readily adopt others’ perspective, which often influences their behavior even when it seemingly should not. This altercentric influence has been widely studied in adults, yet we lack an understanding of its ontogenetic origins. The current studies investigated whether 14-month-olds’ search in a box for potential objects is modulated by another person’s belief about the box’s content. We varied the person’s potential belief such that in her presence/absence an object was removed, added, or exchanged for another, leading to her true/false belief about the object’s presence (Experiment 1, n=96); or transformed into another object, leading to her true/false belief about the object’s identity (i.e., the objects represented under a specific aspect, Experiment 2, n=32). Infants searched longer if the other person believed that an object remained in the box, showing an altercentric influence early in development. These results suggest that infants spontaneously represent others’ beliefs involving multiple objects, and raise the possibility that infants can appreciate that others encode the world under a unique aspect.",

      "abstract": "The central premise of the present chapter is that humans routinely undervalue animals relative to themselves. This devaluing has implications not only for animals, in terms of welfare and exploitation, but also for humans. For instance, devaluing animals increases the social value of representing other social groups as animal-like, thus denying these human groups the protections otherwise afforded to humans (and one's own group). But there are also implications for those who protect animals or, at minimum, refuse to engage in the exploitation of animals. Recent research demonstrates that among many meat eaters, vegans and vegetarians are relatively disliked and viewed as threatening. This is particularly the case for vegans and vegetarians who cite animal justice (vs health or environmental concerns) for their renunciation of meat. Overall the research record increasingly shows that our thinking about animals is intimately and systematically linked to our thinking about other human groups in ways that entrench dominance over animals and those mentally associated with animals. The implications of these associations are explored.",

The focus of this chapter is the third of those sets of options. More precisely, it is concerned with some of the ways in which scientism in some prominent views of the relationship between minds, brains and persons, and of the body, genes and athletic performance, seems to contribute to the development and perpetuation of a conception of performance enhancement in sport that frequently seems to be to the detriment of the welfare of athletes. The reductionism evident in scientistic conceptions of the athlete not only paves the way for pictures, reasoning and values that might justify performance enhancement practices (prohibited or otherwise) that may be detrimental to the health and welfare of the athlete, but it creates conditions that render any apparent 'achievement' hollow, and the realisation of that should surely negatively affect the welfare of the individual person long beyond the point he or she ceases to be an athlete.",

I have framed the question thus to indicate that I shall not be considering the view that killing another human being is always and everywhere morally wrong. I take it as read that there are at least some morally justifiable killings (for instance, in self-defence where no other means of disarming one's attacker is available). Once it is clear what is wrong with killing on some occasions it should become possible to explain why it is not wrong on others. My immediate concern is with the killing of another human being, and with applying my answer to cases of voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia, but light will be shed on whether and, if so, why it is wrong to kill oneself, to kill unborn human beings, and to kill non-human animals especially those whose life has most in common with the life of human beings.",

      "title": "The Metaphysics of Death",
      "abstract": "This collection of seventeen essays deals with the metaphysical, as opposed to the moral issues pertaining to death. For example, the authors investigate (among other things) the issue of what makes death a bad thing for an individual, if indeed death is a bad thing. This issue is more basic and abstract than such moral questions as the particular conditions under which euthanasia is justified, if it is ever justified. Though there are important connections between the more abstract questions addressed in this book and many contemporary moral issues, such as euthanasia, suicide, and abortion, the primary focus of this book is on metaphysical issues concerning the nature of death: What is the nature of the harm or bad involved in death? (If it is not pain, wha is it, and how can it be bad?) Who is the subject of the harm or bad? (if the person is no longer alive, how can he be the subject of the bad? An if he is not the subject, who is? Can one have harm with no subject?) When does the harm take place? (Can a harm take place after its subject ceases to exist? If death harms a person, can the harm take place before the death occurs?) If death can be a bad thing, would immorality be a desirable alternative? This family of questions helps to fram ethe puzzle of why—and how—death is bad. Other subjects addressed include the Epicurean view othat death is not a misfortune (for the person who dies); the nature of misfortune and benefit; the meaningulness and value of life; and the distinction between the life of a person and the life of a living creature who is not a person. There is an extensive bibiography that includes science-fiction treatments of death and immorality.",

T2: God is an omniscient, wholly good being who is omnipotent in the sense that he has (sovereign, providential) control over all existent states of affairs. Why this is so is quite obvious. If T1 is denied, it is difficult to make sense of the standard Christian belief that God can justifiably discipline human agents when they perform actions which violate his commands — i.e., it is difficult to make sense of the basic Christian concepts of sin and punishment. T2 is equally important. If it is denied, it is difficult to make sense of such standard Christian beliefs as (1) God is in control of the significant aspects of our lives, (2) God will bring about his desired goals regardless of the action of human agents, and (3) God is capable of responding in a positive manner to any petitionary prayer that is in keeping with his will.",

For example, conditioned reinforcers are not automatically reinforcing. Stimuli or events which were once neutral in value may acquire reinforcing properties as a result of being paired with events which are already reinforcing — either primary or other conditioned reinforcers. By repeatedly presenting a neutral stimulus prior to or along with a reinforcing stimulus, the neutral stimulus becomes a reinforcer. For example, praise may not be reinforcing for some people: therefore to establish it as a reinforcer it must be paired with an event that is reinforcing, such as food or money. Then when a behaviour is performed, the individual is praised and reinforced with money. After several pairings of the praise with money, the praise alone will serve as a reinforcer.",

      "abstract": "Values are important: a person’s views of moral ways of living are significant determinants of that person’s behaviour – where some people’s moralities might not seem very “moral” to others. People in a society might agree on what is moral behaviour in some circumstances, and disagree in others. Different societies have different agreements, different moralities with different ethical ways of living; and different groups in a particular society might have different moralities with different ethical ways of living. We, from our own social perspective, might not find other moralities acceptable – be those the moralities of other societies or of other groups within our society – and there are basic questions of how we accommodate moralities not our own, or which is the “correct” morality. There are those who think they know what is right and what is wrong, and others who take a more nuanced approach, though they might prefer a certain morality/ideology. On the one hand, Adam Smith, for example, knew there was a true morality which came from God (or the Deity) and thus cultural relativism was based on an incorrect premise – “Part III, Chapter V: Of the influence and authority of the general Rules of Morality, and that they are justly regarded as the Laws of the Deity” [Smith(1759, 1790)]. In a famous/infamous article, Francis Fukuyama when discussing the natures of different types of society (fascist, communist, democratic) made the ideological difference almost one of morality, and he foresaw the ultimate dominance of the morality/ideology of “economic and political liberalism”. He argued that, when talking about changes in communist societies, commentators “sense dimly that there is some larger process at work, a process that gives coherence and order to the daily headlines.” (“The End of History?”, The National Interest, Summer 1989). More recently, a conservative who wanted to be in “perfect harmony with the Bible, the Declaration and the Constitution” saw the USA as irretrievably polarized, and divided into",

      "abstract": "What Evil Must Be in Order to ExistIf God created the world, then what we call \"the evil in the world\" is made possible, and practically unavoidable, by the conjunction of four facts: (1) the fact that God created a finite world and determined the laws of nature to be precisely thus as he in fact determined them to be (and not otherwise); (2) the fact that the created world -in spite of finite resources -is full of beings which are conscious and sensitive to pain, which want to live and to live well; (3) the fact that many creatures, in order to live and live well, use and consume other creatures against the will those creatures have to live and to live well, being more or less forced to do so by the constitution of the world and by their own will to live and to live well; (4) the fact that God gave to the created world a certain amount of independence, not with respect to its sheer existence, but with respect to its development over time: an independence that stems from absolute (ontic, non-epistemic) chance and from free will.However, is what we call \"the evil in the world\" really evil?Does the evil in the world really exist?Evil poses a problem for God's perfection -and for his existence if God is, qua God, taken to be perfectly good, omnipotent, and omniscient -only if evil does itself exist.But the existence of evil has again and again been denied.It has been alleged that evil does not exist, more precisely: that it does not really exist and is therefore properly speaking non-existent, although it might in a sense be called \"existent\"; that evil is only the substanceless, in itself beingless, shadow of being, which will \"pop up\" quite unavoidably if beings distinct from God are present on all the countless levels of (greater or lesser) similitude to God in the manner of existence.It is alleged that the plenitude of creation, on all levels of being, is a consequence of God's perfection; and so is, therefore, the shadow of negativity that necessarily accompanies that plenitude.This shadow is the evil in the world, and although God does not specifically will it, he does accept it and permit it.Indeed, he must accept it and permit it as a sort of \"collateral damage\" of his creating the world in God-imaging plenitude.Nevertheless, no opprobrium falls on God -for evil, it is alleged, does not exist, because it is \"without substance\".Against this classical way of denying the existence of evil, it can, with justice, be objected that it makes use of an overly demanding concept of existence: According to the classical denial, to exist (in the primary, proper sense) means to be substantially real, that is: to be actual and integrated into a substance, or in other words: to be something actual that is a substance or belongs to the \"contents\" of a substance; in short, to exist means to be a res (cf.",

The data used are mostly extracted from Indonesian proverb books, and ones found in proverbs of other languages. First, the data are classified based on plants or parts of plant possibly concurred. Later, the investigation is directed toward the various possibility the combination might represent. Through careful analysis, it is finally found that the plants or parts of the plants to be combined can be between different plants, parts of the same plants, one plant and its parts, parts and different plants, and parts of different plants. Plants or parts of plants to be combined are perceived as: to have the same quality for representing something hard or impossible to change, something must be committed by both parties, the same destiny to be experienced, or how should someone to behave; the different quality of plants or parts of the plant is used to represent unexpected thing (better or worse) to happen, not easy to give up and always depend on something available, could differentiate between good and bad matters, to use the worse quality things first before the better ones, imbalance competition, ability and sincerity to accept the good and bad aspect of things; one plant or parts of the plant are older (coming out earlier) or younger (coming out later) than the others to represent the difficulties for the older people to change, any occasion follows cause and effect law, the new comers usually should or could not drive out or defeat the natives; and phonological representation to show that sometimes the proverbs are created on the basis of aesthetic achievements instead of merely on metaphorical similarities.",

Animal protection basically refers to the prevention, reduction, fear of harm or elimination of harm done by human to animals. And jurisprudence which means the ‘Theory or philosophy of law’. In modern law, animals are not considered as a legal person, they are always treated as an object. The objects cannot exercise their rights like right to life. Human has developed the ideal philosophy for the betterment of the animals but still they are not capable for the proper and total implementation for that philosophy. The animals were treated as associate of God or part of nature but also treated as property or things. The things are the same as wild animals has been always treated as danger, but the real danger is human to this planet, who forgot the humanity.",

Spiritual stumbling of modern man is a result of ratiocentrism (that is, his abandoning the concept of theocentrism) with despair and loss of morality turning the complex body-spirit bond into an instrument and the sport competition itself into an alienating form of achieving results at all costs. As a result, athletes themselves as main participants in competitions (either against other competitors or against themselves) have become an instrument-tool for gaining profit. Spiritual stumbling have generated moral crisis and left sports and their participants without any human dimension of existence degrading them to a single physical dimension and its merciless and brutal exploitation.",

      "abstract": "“God makes each thing beautiful in its time.” This quote has somewhat found its common usage in social media. People have some habit of quoting this expression whenever they encounter difficulties so as to comfort themselves. Through these words, a person might hope earnestly that “God will help me or provide me with the ‘beautiful’ time someday.” But the question that immediately follows is “When?” What if the burden stays and life remains unchanged? Not many of the fans of these wise words know that the saying originates from the Book of Ecclesiastes (3:11), which in itself is a form of ancient Hebrew literature. In the complete verse of the Book, the clause “He hath made every thing beautiful in his time is followed by another clause, “also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.” The later part of the verse (3:11b) is often ignored. However, by accepting the words that “God hath set the world in their heart”, one realises that he or she cannot fathom God’s mind, but might make peace and accept that divine question. Hence, one might realise that both good times and the not-so-good times could be but “beautiful times” for oneself.",

In the simple gift/ return-gift processes, there are two agents, and agent i hands out gift xi to agent j who reciprocates with the return gift xj to agent i. The xi and xj can a priori be of any nature, but we will consider later the “quantitative case” in which each gift is a quantity of a good. A notable issue is that of gift refusal, the possibility of refusing a gift in totality or in part, and its consequences. This can apply to the initial gift, to the return gift, or to both. The issue of gift refusal is disregarded in this section for simplicity and because, in a number of cases, it does not matter, or does not occur, or even cannot occur. (It may be that the agents do not refuse because they appreciate the other's gift, or only the gifts offered matter, or refusing the gift or returning it back may not be possible for a material reason or because of a norm internalized or imposed by social pressure, or the giver may be able to refuse the refusal – for instance in not “taking back” something refused –, and so on).",

Or we may understand it as a stretching to an extreme degree of capacity, as tending to pull asunder, to render disjunct from proper use, as subjecting to pressure or exigency. Straining, one may embrace, clasping tightly in one's arms; one may thereby constrict, compress, contract, diminish. One may force beyond an object's legitimate extent or scope; to strain may then be to impair or to imperil the strength of a material thing by excessive tension. In later use and in a wider sense, strain will be force or pressure tending to cause fracture, change of position, or alteration of shape. It is, as well, the condition of a body or a particle subjected to such force or pressure. We speak, too, of diction or of thought, when labored or affected, as strained.",

      "title": "Intra-Trinitarian Love",
      "abstract": "The most powerful speculative argument for a three-consciousness view of the Trinity probably lies in the consideration that ‘God is love’ (1 John, 4, 8). The argument is that if God is essentially loving, then there must be someone for God to love. Richard Swinburne defines love partly as ‘giving to the other what of one's own is good for him’ (Swinburne, 1994, p. 177). God is omniscient and omnipotent, and if God is to give fully what is God's own, then God must create another omniscient, omnipotent being. There is a question about whether an omnipotent being can create another omnipotent being. Obviously not if ‘omnipotence’ means, or entails, that one has complete power over every other being so that one can create or destroy it at will. If God exists necessarily (that is, God exists whatever else may or may not exist and could not possibly fail to exist), then it may seem that no created being exists necessarily, since it could not exist without its creator. It may be, however, that God necessarily creates another being which, given the existence of God, could not fail to exist. That would entail that God could not destroy it. Yet their relation would be asymmetric, because God would be the cause of the created being, and it could not be the cause of God. The created being would be wholly dependent on the creating being, since the creator has given what is ‘its own’ to the created. The created being receives its power and knowledge from the uncreated being and could not ever oppose it or know anything that it did not know. This would not be an instance of mutual causation, so they would not be omnipotent in quite the same sense.",

Many kinds of damage may be litigated against, taken to court, proven, and compensated for. But sometimes a damage cannot be expressed, whether because the being who undergoes the damage is unable to speak in a language to which the judges will listen (as in the case of animals, children, the mentally ill, the dead), or because the judges are the ones who have done the damage, whether directly or through affiliation, or because the testimony of the one damaged is deprived of authority for whatever reason.3 Such a scenario is called a differend, and the person who suffers from both a damage and a loss of the ability to prove it is a victim.4 Lyotard's primary example is of the victims of Auschwitz, who were simultaneously damaged, that is killed, and deprived of the ability to bear witness to what was done to them, because they are dead. Anyone else who might testify to Auschwitz may have her authority undermined by Holocaust deniers by the very fact that she is alive and hence cannot have seen what happened in the chambers, since the only witnesses to what occurred there are dead.5 More common examples may be helpful, however, and I would like to consider a few that gender my discussion of differends.",

      "title": "Utilitarianism",
      "abstract": "Utilitarianism is a moral theory that judges actions based on their consequences—specifically, based on their effects on well-being. Most utilitarians take well-being to be constituted largely by happiness, and historically utilitarianism has been known by the phrase “the greatest happiness for the greatest number.” As the second part of this phrase suggests, utilitarianism is concerned with the well-being of all people, not just the person who performs an action or the people most directly affected; in fact, because nonhuman animals can also experience pleasure and pain, their well-being also counts in the moral assessment of actions, according to most utilitarians. Thus, a simple statement of the utilitarian view is that an action is right if and only if it brings about at least as much overall well-being as any action the agent could have performed instead. Controversially, this means that, according to utilitarianism, in principle, any type of action—such as lying, stealing, or even killing someone—could conceivably be condoned by utilitarianism if, in the particular circumstances, it would produce at least as much overall well-being as anything else the agent could have done. Utilitarians tend to condemn such actions because they tend to reduce overall well-being, but they hold that the impact on well-being is what makes such actions wrong—not their being prohibited by conventionally accepted moral rules, the commands of a deity, principles of human rights, or other considerations that can conflict with the fundamental moral goal of maximizing overall well-being. In addition to the straightforward form of utilitarianism summarized above, there are other forms of the view, such as ones that judge acts not in terms of their direct effects on overall well-being, but in terms of their compliance with rules whose general acceptance tends to promote well-being. All forms of the view, however, hold that the moral assessment of acts derives directly or indirectly from the fundamental utilitarian moral criterion of the maximization of overall well-being.",

      "title": "Duty",
      "abstract": "To have a duty is, above all, to be subject to a binding, normative requirement. This means that unless there are exculpating reasons someone who has a duty is required to satisfy it, and can be justifiably criticized for not doing so. Having a duty to do something is like having been given a command by someone who has a right to be obeyed: it must be done. Sometimes we speak as if we have duties to individuals (such as persons and institutions). So, for example, if Jones makes a promise to Smith, then Jones has a duty to Smith to keep the promise. We also talk as if we have duties to perform, or to refrain from performing, types of actions, for instance, a duty to help those in need. Even if the performance of such a duty involves treating an individual in a certain way, the duty may not be to that individual. For example, a duty to be charitable might not be a duty to anyone, not even the recipient of the charity. An important feature of duties is that they provide some justifying reason for action. If we explain why we did something by saying that it was our duty, we are offering a justification for the action. Such a justifying reason does not depend on the entire nature of the action. For example, if we make a promise, we have some justifying reason for keeping it, regardless of what was promised, or to whom the promise was made. Again it is like a command. If we are given a command by someone with a right to be obeyed, we have some justification for obeying it, no matter what we are commanded to do. On some views, however, the justifying reason we have for doing something because it is required by duty may not be decisive: we may have an even better reason for doing something else. None the less, that something is required by duty provides some justifying reason for doing it. Talk about duties is found in many areas; we speak, for example, of legal duties, moral duties, professional duties, the duties of a scholar and, even, matrimonial duties. This discussion will focus on moral duty, but may have wider application.",

Suppose that one of the trucking companies has a record of past dominance in such situations, and that the other has finally decided to make a stand. (Such an occurrence is not without parallels in both domestic and international relations. The Western containment policy with respect to the Soviet bloc, for instance, provides numerous similar confrontations.) Or suppose that inherent situational symmetry (Why should he have more right to pass than I?), pride, stubbornness, or other emotional involvement of the participants, brings about a genuine impasse. Each antagonist in this example has an interest in expeditious, non-violent resolution of the conflict. There are also innocent bystanders with a similar interest, who wish to see the road cleared and explosion damage to their property avoided. The presence of comparatively disinterested third parties is characteristic of almost any dispute. Their objective is to achieve resolution of the conflict on any reasonable terms, without particular preference over a wide range of possible settlement outcomes. In the case in hand, an offer of compulsory arbitration by some bystander may well be rejected, because neither trucker can be sure of the absence of hidden bias on the part of the volunteer arbitrator. If, however, someone offers to flip a coin, it is clear that there now exists a probably mutually acceptable means for resolving the otherwise hopeless conflict. Moreover, the chance settlement means becomes more, not less, effective as the emotional involvement and irrational commitment of the antagonists increase. This is a crucial point. The chance mechanism is specific for resolving the type of conflict in which conventional bargaining has had its opportunity and has failed. Let us expand this theme and see how it might be institutionalized for the resolution of a wider class of hopeless conflicts. Several broad requirements must be met. First, an acceptable conflict-resolving mechanism, whatever its precise nature, must provide no motivation to the principals to convert a bargaining conflict into a hopeless one. Judicious introduction of randomness into the settlement mechanism would seem to satisfy this requirement by offering the protagonists every inducement to let reason prevail before chance had to be invoked. Secondly, it may be desirable or even necessary to invest settlement proceedings with a formalized (legal, ethical, etc.) structure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract I argue in Chapter 6 that organisms are never optimally designed. Designs of organs, developmental programs, etc. are legacies from the past and natural selection can affect them in only two ways. It can adjust the numbers of mutually exclusive designs until they reach frequency­ dependent equilibria, often with only one design that excludes alternatives. It can also optimize a design’s parameters so as to maximize the fitness attainable with that design under current conditions. This is what is usually meant by optimization in biology. An analogy might be the common wooden-handled, steel-bladed tool design. With different parameter values it could be a knife, a screw driver, or many other kinds of tool-many, but not all. The fixed-blade constraint would rule out turning it into a drill with meshing gears. The wood-and-steel constraint would rule out use as a hand lens.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews four types of personality disorders. Narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive personality disorders. Here is a brief introduction to these four personality disorders: The avoidant personality disorder is defined by a constant feeling of inadequacy. Patients with this disorder are hepersensitive to negative situations and they fear of being criticized of rejected. Thus, they avoid social and cultural interactions. They have limited themselves into a small line of close friends. The narcissistic personality disorder can cause great difficulties in interpersonal relationships, especially marriage. This is because narcissists are always self-righteousness and the world should revolve around them. Narcissistic people are not able to love others. They do not understand love (they constantly ridicule others and humiliate their subordinates). However, they take advantage of concept of love in order to deceive and trap others but it is all theatrics and role-playing. People with dependent personality disorder typically rely on others for their needs. They expect that others accept responsibility for most important issues in life. They lack self-confidence. They feel intense dissatisfaction whenever they feel lonely, even for a short time. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is presented by discipline-oriented perfectionism and psychological control. The individuals with this disorder try to be in control of everything through careful attention to norms, details, lists and programs. They are extremely careful, repeat every task for several times, and pay special attention to details and frequently resolve probable mistakes. They do not pay attention to the fact that other people feel upset in case of delays and discomfort that arises from their excessive behavior.",

      "title": "Explaining Variation in Individual Aging, Its Sources, and Consequences: A Comprehensive Conceptual Model of Human Aging",
      "abstract": "We define aging as a characteristic deterioration in one (or more) observable attributes of an organism that typically occurs during later life. With this narrow functional definition, we gain the freedom to separate aging from other processes of age-related change (e.g., maturation, growth, illness, terminal decline). We introduce a structural model that distinguishes between (1) the phenomenon of aging, (2) the subjective experience of aging, (3) sources of aging, and (4) consequences of aging. A core focus of the model is on the role of buffering mechanisms of biological repair and personal adaptation that regulate the relations between sources of aging, aging proper, and its consequences. The quality and level of functioning of these buffering mechanisms also varies across the life span, which directly affects the sources of aging, resulting in either resilience against or accelerated aging, and thus can be considered to be a major source of the variation in aging processes among different individuals. External factors comprising attributes of the physical environment and sociocultural characteristics are considered as contexts in which aging occurs. These contextual factors are assumed to feed into the various components of the model. Our model provides an interdisciplinary account of human aging, its sources and consequences, and also its subjective experience, by integrating biological, psychological, lifestyle, and sociocultural factors, and by specifying their interrelations and interactions. The model provides a comprehensive understanding of individual human aging, its underlying processes, and modulating factors. It allows for the derivation of empirically testable hypotheses, and it helps practitioners to identify elements that lend themselves to targeted intervention efforts aimed at increasing the resilience of individuals against aging and buffering its negative consequences.",

If this principle, ever since known as Occam's razor, be used to shave off redundant postulates about human behavior, only three fundamental propositions remain, to wit: First, all men, at all times, have endeavored to retain their health, prolong their lives, and expand their knowledge of and control over their physical environment. Second, they have sought to establish and enhance their interpersonal relationships so as to achieve greater familial, economic, social, and cultural securities. Third, they have cherished various systems of beliefs an eternal search for philosophic or religious serenity. Anyone reasonably successful all these spheres is regarded by his social order as being in good physical and mental health; indeed, the very term health, as derived from the Anglo-Saxon root hai or hoi, has the triple connotation of hale (physical well-being), hail! (social greeting), and wholesome and holy (philosophically and theologically acceptable). Conversely, anyone who fails his material, cultural, or philosophic adaptations experiences deep anxiety or ndis-ease.M Technically, the latter term should apply only to the first category of failures, which organic defects, infections, injuries, or deteriorations actually impair oneTs physical capacities.

Mainstream economics and Marxism describe human participation in economic and societal production through a human-commodity framework. Intangible flow theory aims to replace that framework and interrelated conjectures as human capital, human assets and human resources. This theory is not exclusively applicable to capitalist/market organization forms. It suggests that (a) commodities are physical goods, and exhibit known characteristics differentiating them from human-related flows as service or knowledge flows; (b) human work has properties that make it akin to quasi-service production; (c) humans are not commodities, capital, assets or resources; (d) machines can obtain the skills necessary to replace human work or perform novel tasks when previously intangible dimensions are turned tangible (tangibilization); and (e) cash-flows generated or saved by those machines tend to flow to human beings who own or control them. According to this theory, greater attention must be paid to flows of economic material elements that display a relevant degree of empirical precision (e.g., cash and physical goods flows).

      "abstract": "The obligation of society to the individual who is given to criminal practices, or who possesses criminal tendencies, or who, whether innocent or guilty, has been accused of crime, is no longer debatable. Indeed, in a country where government rests upon the shoulders of the governed, and is for the governed, in a very real sense, the duty which society owes to the individual is only another name for the duty society owes to itself. Each member of society faces not only the possibility of being accused of crime, but also the potentialities of becoming himself involved in criminal practices. Digressions from the most rigid codes of righteousness, lead by almost imperceptible gradations into the dark fields of criminality. Even so earnest a well-doer as the Apostle Paul said to the world the good he would he did not, and also the evil he would not, he did. It is obvious, therefore, the safeguards and helps with which we surround our neighbor (and is not he who has fallen among thieves our neighbor, indeed?), we at once surround ourselves and our sacred firesides. Verily, with what measure we mete, it shall be measured to us again. Moreover, society's fight is not with the individual, but for the individual. Man is not born a criminal. The innocent babe born in the vilest dive is not a criminal. If in later life his footsteps lead him into the mire, it is because the mire is there and the allurements of the ensnaring marsh-lights of evil are flashed about him during those impressionable years when his gaze should be directed to the mountain peaks of honor and honest toil, and when his hours of play should be spent in the sunlight of virtue and love. Probably nowhere in the whole gamut of human endeavor is the maxim that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so true as it is in our dealings with the problem of crime. Our duty is plain, our goal is clear; but the steps by which we can best discharge the duty and attain the desired end are not always obvious, nor the construction of the ma-",

A man who takes up a system of divinity with a previous opinion, that either every part must be true, or the whole false, approaches the discussion with great disadvantage. No other system, which is founded upon moral evidence, would bear to be treated in the same manner. Nevertheless, in a certain degree, we are all introduced to our religious studies under this prejudication. And it cannot be avoided. The weakness of the human judgement in the early part of youth, yet its extreme susceptibility of impression, renders it necessary to furnish it with some opinions, and with some principles or other. Or indeed, without much express care, or much endeavour for this purpose, the tendency of the mind of man to assimilate itself to the habits of thinking and speaking which prevail around him, produces the same effect. That indifferency and suspense, that waiting and equilibrium of the judgement, which some require in religious matters, and which some would wish to be aimed at in the conduct of education, are impossible to be preserved. They are not given to the condition of human life.",

Prosocial behavior is consistent with social norms and provides a convenient antonym for antisocial behavior, or non‐normative behaviors such as crime and most forms of aggression. Helping is a prosocial subtype and refers to any behavior that has positive consequences for another. The helper's motivation may be altruistic or egoistic. Altruism is a special form of helping. The altruist is motivated by the ultimate goal of improving another's well‐being regardless of possible personal costs. Although the altruist may garner rewards in the act of helping, this does not preclude the altruistic intent. In contrast, egoistic responses are self‐serving and motivated by the desire to improve one's own welfare. The connection between altruism and prosocial behavior varies. Prosocial behavior will not always be altruistically motivated, and altruistic motivation will not always generate prosocial behavior (Batson 1991).",

      "abstract": "There is agency in all we do: thinking, doing, or making. We invent a tune, play, or use it to celebrate an occasion. Or we make a conceptual leap and ask more abstract questions about the conditions for agency. They include autonomy and self-appraisal, each contested by arguments immersing us in circumstances we don’t control. But can it be true we that have no personal responsibility for all we think and do? 'Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will' proposes that deliberation, choice, and free will emerged within the evolutionary history of animals with a physical advantage: organisms having cell walls or exoskeletons had an internal space within which to protect themselves from external threats or encounters. This defense was both structural and active: such organisms could ignore intrusions or inhibit risky behavior. Their capacities evolved with time: inhibition became the power to deliberate and choose the manner of one’s responses. Hence the ability of humans and some other animals to determine their reactions to problematic situations or to information that alters values and choices. This is free will as a material power, not as the conclusion to a conceptual argument. Having it makes us morally responsible for much we do. It prefigures moral identity. Closely argued but plainly written, 'Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will' speaks for autonomy and responsibility when both are eclipsed by ideas that embed us in history or tradition. Our sense of moral choice and freedom is accurate. We are not altogether the creatures of our circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Autonomy means that although something is part of something else, or related to it in some way, it has its own “law” or “tendency” (Greek, no-mos). In their book on life sciences, Medawar and Medawar state, “Organs and tissues [...] are composed of cells which [...] have a high measure of autonomy.” Autonomy also has ethical and political valences. De Grazia writes, “In Kant’s enormously influential moral philosophy, autonomy, or free-dom from the causal determinism of nature, became prominent in justifying the human use of animals.” One of the oldest uses of autonomy in English is a description of the French civil war from the late sixteenth century: “Others of the [...] rebellion entred in counsell, whether they ought to admit the King vpon reasonable conditions, specially hauing their autonomy.” Life, and in particular human life, and in particular human politics, is well served by the usages of autonomy. What about the rest of reality, however? Should it be thought of, if it’s even considered real and mind-independent, as pure stuff for the manipulation or decorative tastes of truly autonomous beings? We tend to think of things such as paperweights and iPhones as mere tools of human design and human use. To use them is to cause them to exist as fully and properly as they can. But according to Martin Heidegger, when a tool such as a paperweight is used, it disappears, or withdraws (Ent-zug). We are preoccupied with copying the page that the paperweight is holding down. We are concerned with an essay deadline, and the paper-weight simply disappears into this general project. If the paperweight slips, or if the iPhone freezes, we might notice it. All of a sudden it becomes vorhanden (present-at-hand) rather than zuhanden (ready-to-hand).",

A person’s life is cut off, and if there is a difference between the nations regarding the preservation of these necessities, it is in the manner of preserving them, not in their origin. The research has been called the nature of legitimacy for crimes of necessity; Because the meaning of necessity is a comprehensive meaning that touches on many matters, and a person must be characterized by reconciliation with himself and with others, and the noble Islamic Sharia has considered that any aggression that occurs against these universals or one of them is considered a crime in the eyes of Sharia that deserves the punishment specified by the Sharia. Islam did not leave the matter in vain, as the Almighty said: (ﮚ ﮛ ﮜ ﮝ ﮞ) but rather set the limits&#x0D; And enact the way to know what is beneficial that must be sought and commanded, and what is harmful must be avoided and abstained from. And all of this came through the provisions that God enacted for his servants. As these commands and prohibitions are the sections of the ruling with which the Islamic street addressed the taxpayers. In this research, I dealt with some of the rulings on a number of issues in advance by defining them and explaining their divisions as follows: Definition of governance and its divisions, intention and permission, legal nature of necessity, comparison between Sharia and law in the nature of necessity,&#x0D; I have interpreted the verses, explained the hadiths, criticism and deduction, and listed the opinions of scholars and tried to explain the most correct one.

Excretory products (Mala) are important in human physiology. They are formed in routine physiological and metabolic activities in the body. It is important to cleanse or purify the body by removing the waste. If accumulated, the mala has the ability to pollute the Dosha and Dhatu of the body.

      "title": "The Pultibec System for the Medical Assessment of Handicapped Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The Pultibec System was evolved as an attempt to fulfil the recognised need for a global, yet concise, system for coding the difficulties of children with multiple handicaps in functional terms. The child's individual functional capacities are placed under eight main headings (in English the code letters of these headings form the term ‘Pultibec’). These eight headings embrace four mainly physical qualities , i.e.: P = Physical capacity (endurance and general health) U = Upper limbs (divided into hand—H, arm—A, right and left) L = Locomotion (divided into right and left lower limbs) T = Toilet and four qualities mainly of behaviour and communication , i.e.: I = Intelligence B = Behaviour E = Vision (Eyes) (divided into right eye—E and left eye—E) C = Communication (divided into hearing—H and speech—S). Each of the above qualities and their subsidiaries is divided into 6 main grades, but in relation to hand, arm and lower limb, 5 additional intermediate grades were found necessary. Generally speaking, grade I denotes complete normality in every respect, grades 2–5 progressively poorer function and finally grade 6 which denotes that function in that quality is virtually absent. When doing the Pultibec there are 114 possible grades under the 14 ‘qualities' to be considered during a medical examination. In practice, the appropriate grade is often obvious and the system is much quicker than it would first appear to be on paper. In contrast, when reading a Pultibec, only 14 ‘qualities' under the 8 main headings have to be read and, as the majority are likely to be normal, the number actually needing perusal is far less, rendering its interpretation a relatively quick task. The Pultibec system is an attempt to translate the complexities of medical terminology and case note‐taking, into a common language which is concise and easily understood in functional terms as between medical practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, education officers, teachers, psychologists, youth employment officers, employers and last, but by no means least, the parents of the handicapped child. RÉSUMÉ Le système ‘Pultibec’ a été développé pour tenter de remédier au manque évident d'un code en termes fonctionnels, complet et pourtant concis, desdi fficultés des enfants atteints de multiples handicaps. Les capacités fonctionnelles propres à chaque enfant sont rangées en 8 chapitres principaux (les initiales des titres de ces chapitres en Anglais forment le mot Pultibec). Ces 8 titres comprennent: 4 qualités essentiellement physiques, à savoir: P = Physical capacity (capacité physique), endurance et état général U = Upper limbs (membres supérieurs), divisé en bras A et main H, droit et gauche L = Locomotion (locomotion), divisé en membres inférieurs, droit et gauche T = Toilet (habitudes d'hygiène) et 4 qualités essentiellement de comportement et de communication, à savoir: I = Intelligence (intelligence) B = Behaviour (comportement) E = Vision (Eyes) (vision, yeux), divisé entre oeil droit E et oeil gauche E C = Communication (communication), divisé en ouïe H et diction S. Chacune des qualités mentionnées plus haut et de leurs subdivisions est estimée par 6 cotes principals, mais pour la main, le bras et les membres inférieurs 5 cotes intermédiaires ont dûêtre ajoutées. D'une façon générale la cote 1 dénote la normalité complète sous tous les rapports, les cotes 2 à 5 une fonction progressivement apprauvie, et, finalement, la cote 6 dénote la perte virtuellement totale de la fonction. 114 cotes possibles rangées en 14 ‘qualités' sont à considérer au cours de l'examen médical par le Pultibec. En pratique, la cote appropriée est souvent évidente et le système est bien plus rapide qu'il n'apparait à première vue sur le papier. Par contre, à la lecture du Pultibec on n'a à lire que 14 ‘qualités' rangées en 8 chapitres et, comme la majorité risque bien d'être normale. le nombre qui demande réellement attention est moindre, ce qui fait de l'interprétation une besogne relativement rapide. Le système Pultibec est une tentative de traduction des complexités de la terminologie médicale et des notes d'observation d'un cas en un language commun, concis et facilement compris en termes fonctionnels par médecins, infirmières, physiothérapistes, éducateurs, instituteurs, psychologistcs, personnel des bureaux de placement des jeunes, employeurs, et, cités les derniers mais certainement pas les moins importants, les parents de l'enfant handicapé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Das ‘Pultibec’ System wurde erfunden, um dem allgemeinen Bedarf, einer auf der ganzen Welt gültigen einfachen Verzeichnisweise der Schwierigkeiten von Kindern mit multiplen Behinderungen in funktioneller Terminologie nachzukommen. Die einzelnen funktionellen Fähigkeiten des Kindes wurden unter acht Haupttitel (im Englischen formen die Anfangsbuchstaben das Wort ‘Pultibec’) gegliedert. Diese acht Titel treffen auf vier hauptsächlich körperliche Eigenschaften zu, d.h.: P = Physical capacity (körperliche Fähigkeit) Ausdauer und Allgemeinzustand U = Upper limbs (obere Glieder) eingeteilt in Hand‐ H, Arm=A, rechts &amp; links L = Locomotion (Fortbewegung) eingeteilt in rechts &amp; links der unteren Glieder T = Toilet (Toilet‐Training) und vier hauptsächlich Verhaltungs—und Umgangsfähigkeiten, d.h.: I = Intelligence (Intelligenz) B = Behaviour (Benehmen, Verhaltung) E = Vision (Eyes)—Augenvision, eingeteilt in rechtes Auge = E, und linkes Auge = E C = Communication (Umgansfähigkeit) eingeteilt in Hören = H, und Sprache = S. Jede dieser Eigenschaften und ihre Nebengruppen werden in sechs Hauptstufen gegliedert, jedoch war es notwendig, in Bezug auf Hand, Arm und die unteren Glieder, fünf zusätzliche Zwischenstufen zu setzen. Im Allgemeinen bezeichnet Stufe No. 1 einen vollkommenen Normalzustand in jeder Beziehung, die Stufen 2–5 steigernd verschlechterte Funktion, während die letzte Stufe (No. 6) einen Zustand bezeichnet, bei dem die Funktion praktisch fehlt. Bei Gebrauch des ‘Pultibec’ Systems ist es möglich, 114 Stufen in den 14 ‘Fähigkeiten’ während der medizinischen Untersuchung zu unterscheiden. In der Praxis, ergibt sich die passende Stufe meistens leicht und man kann das System viel schneller anwenden, als die Beschreibung auf dem Papier andeutet. Hingegen ist es nur nötig 14 ‘Fähigkeiten’ unter den acht Haupttiteln zu lesen und, da die Mehrzahl davon normal sein werden, ist die eigentliche Anzahl, die zu ermessen ist, eine viel kleinere, was die Deutung eine verhältnismässig leichte Aufgabc macht. Mit dem ‘Pultibec’ System wird ein Versuch gemacht, die Schwierigkeiten der medizinischen Terminologie und des Annotierens der Fälle, unter einen gemcinsamen Nenner zu bringen, in einer Sprache, die einfach und leicht verständlich im Bezug auf funktionelles, für Mediziner, Krankenpflegepersonal, Jugendfürsorger, Arbeitgeber und schliesslich auch und ebenso wichtig, für die Eltern des behinderten Kindes geeignet ist.",

      "title": "The Amygdala and Unconscious Fear Processing",
      "abstract": "Abstract In both animals and humans, immediate threats in the environment trigger a fixed pattern of physiological and behavioural responses known as ‘fear’. Since rapid and appropriate responses to external danger are advantageous for survival, neural mechanisms mediating fear responses will be subject to strong evolutionary selection pressure and show conservation across species (Darwin, 1872). The amygdala, an almond-shaped nucleus in the medial temporal lobe, appears to be a crucial component of this phylogenetically ancient ‘fear system’ (LeDoux, 1996). Electrical stimulation of the amygdala, whether in human, monkey, rat, or lizard, consistently evokes fear responses (Halgren et al., 1978; Greenberg et al., 1984; LeDoux, 1987). Destruction of the amygdala, on the other hand, typically produces placid, tame animals that no longer respond appropriately to threatening stimuli (Kluver and Bucy, 1939; Weiskrantz, 1956). The amygdala has also been shown to have a central role in ‘fear’ conditioning, i.e. the process by which a previously neutral object (conditioned stimulus or CS+) acquires fear responses (LeDoux et al., 1990; Davis 1992; Kapp et al., 1992).",

      "abstract": "Mrs. Lydia Maria Child (1802-1880), a prolific writer and humanitarian reformer, wrote the most widely read early 19th century book to guide mothers in the correct management of their children. Here is her advice on how to develop good affections or character in a child: It is a common opinion that a spirit of revenge is natural to children. No doubt bad temper, as well as other evils, moral and physical, are often hereditary–and here is a fresh reason for being good ourselves, if we would have our children good. But allowing that evil propensities are hereditary, and therefore born with children, how are they excited, and called into action? First, by the influences of the nursery–those early influences, which, beginning as they do with life itself, are easily mistaken for the operations of nature; and in the second place, by the temptations of the world. Now, if a child has ever so bad propensities, if the influences of the nursery be pure and holy, his evils will never be excited, or roused into action, until his understanding is enlightened, and his principles formed, so that he has power to resist them. The temptations of the world will do him no harm; he will \"overcome evil with good.\" But if, on the other hand, the influences of the nursery are bad, the weak passions of the child are strengthened before his understanding is made strong; he gets into habits of evil before he is capable of perceiving that they are evil. Consequently, when he comes out into the world, he brings no armor against its temptations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Someone may intend to build a squirrel house without having decided to do it, deliberated about it, formed an intention to do it, or reasoned about it. And despite his intention, he may never build a squirrel house, try to build a squirrel house, or do anything whatever with the intention of getting a squirrel house built. Pure intending of this kind, intending that may occur without practical reasoning, action, or consequence, poses a problem if we want to give an account of the concept of intention that does not invoke unanalysed episodes or attitudes like willing, mysterious acts of the will, or kinds of causation foreign to science. When action is added to intention, for example when someone nails two boards together with the intention of building a squirrel house, then it may at first seem that the same problem does not necessarily arise.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We must examine further now the manner in which obligations not congenital to man arise for him thereafter from some act of his, and how, by virtue of this act, there also springs up in others a certain right which they were formerly lacking. For these two things follow one another in such a way that whenever an obligation arises in one person a corresponding right springs up in another, since it is impossible to understand how I can be obligated to furnish something unless someone is able to demand it or, at least, properly to receive it from me. Yet the reverse, that a right in one person is immediately followed by an obligation in another, is not always the case (as, for example, while there is in rulers a right to exact punishment, the guilty are not obligated to submit to it), unless we are willing to say the following: A right, if taken narrowly as a faculty and competence to have something, always corresponds to an obligation in another; not always, however, if it denotes a faculty to do something.",

No other animal passes so large a portion of its existence in a state of absolute helplessness, or falls in old age into such protracted and lamentable imbecility. To no other warm-blooded animal has nature denied that indispensable covering without which the vicissitudes of a temperate and the rigours of a cold climate are equally insupportable; and to scarcely any has she been so sparing in external weapons, whether for attack or defence. Destitute alike of speed to avoid and of arms to repel the aggressions of his voracious foes; tenderly susceptible of atmospheric influences; and unfitted for the coarse aliments which the earth affords spontaneously during at least two thirds of the year, even in temperate climates, — man, if abandoned to mere instinct, would be of all creatures the most destitute and miserable.",

      "title": "Infants' representation of objects and substances : three experiments on the core principles of rigidity and cohesion",
      "abstract": "A physical entity can be represented either as an individual kind, or as a substance kind, whereby identity is only ascribed to the individual kind. This thesis examined these kinds of representations in infancy. Two main properties of a rigid object, which is typically represented as an individual kind, constituted the core of the thesis: the rigidity of the object (i.e., guaranteeing its stable shape) and the cohesiveness of the object (i.e., guaranteeing its internal connectedness). However, non-rigid or non-cohesive physical entities are not necessarily represented as a substance kind. This means, non-solid substances or collections of objects may well be represented as, for instance, drops of water or flocks of birds. Even infants’ representation of individual kinds is not restricted to rigid objects, but extends to collections of objects (Wynn, Bloom, & Chiang, 2002) or portions of a deformable substance (Huntley-Fenner, Carey, & Solimando, 2002). Yet the exact natures of the processes that promote an individual-based or a substance-based representation in infants remain unclear. Three studies examined the effects of non-rigidity and non-cohesiveness on 8- to 12-month-old infants’ representation of physical entities. This was based on measures of infants’ visual attention (i.e., looking time in Study 1, duration and location of gazes in Study 2) and on action-based measures (i.e., manual search in Study 3). Additionally, an unmodified version of Study 2 was conducted with adults. Taken together, the results of these studies demonstrated that unambiguous spatiotemporal information (e.g., two well-defined groups) but not featural information (e.g., shape) enables infants to represent non-rigid and non-cohesive entities as individual kinds. At the same time, spatiotemporal information prevented infants from maintaining such representations if this information did not appropriately mark individuals. Furthermore, individual-based processing was subject to a limitation set by the number of objects in a collection. That is, infants’ representation was individual-based in the case of small collections but substance- based in the case of large collections. These findings add to the infancy literature, and further highlight the parallels to adults’ representation of individuals and substances. That is, similar to the current findings adults’ processing of individuals is based primarily on spatiotemporal information, as well as it is subject to a set size limit (vanMarle & Scholl, 2003). 2\r\nEine physikalische Entitat kann in Form eines Individuums oder in Form einer Substanz reprasentiert werden, wobei nur dem Individuum eine Identitat zugeschrieben wird. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersuchte diese zwei Arten der Reprasentation einer physikalischen Entitat im Sauglingsalter. Zwei zentrale Eigenschaften eines rigiden Objektes, welches typischerweise als Individuum reprasentiert wird, standen dabei im Zentrum: die Rigiditat des Objektes als Garant der Formstabilitat und die Kohasion des Objektes als Garant des inneren Zusammenhalts. Nicht-rigide und nicht-kohasive Entitaten werden jedoch nicht zwangslaufig als Substanz reprasentiert. So konnen zum Beispiel nicht-solide Substanzen oder kollektive Entitaten als Wassertropfen oder als Vogelschwarm reprasentiert werden. Bereits im Sauglingsalter umfasst die Reprasentation von Individuen neben rigiden Objekte zum Beispiel auch kollektive Entitaten oder verformbare Substanzen (Wynn et al., 2002; Huntley-Fenner et al., 2002). Der Prozess, welcher zu einer individuumsbasierten oder einer substanzbasierten Reprasentation einer Entitat fuhrt, ist jedoch unklar. Drei Studien untersuchten die Auswirkungen von fehlender Rigiditat und fehlender Kohasion auf die Reprasentation physikalischer Entitaten bei 8- bis 12 Monate alten Sauglingen. In den Studien wurden Masse der visuellen Aufmerksamkeit (Blickzeiten in Studie 1, Blickzeiten und Blickrichtung in Studie 2) und handlungsbasierte Masse (manuelle Suche in Studie 3) erhoben. Studie 3 wurde zudem in unveranderter Form mit einer Gruppe Erwachsener durchgefuhrt. Aus der Summe der Ergebnisse dieser Studien lassen sich zwei globale Schlussfolgerungen ziehen. Zum einen befahigte eindeutige raumzeitliche Information (z.B. eine klar begrenzte Gruppe) aber nicht Eigenschaftsinformation (z.B. die Form) die Sauglinge, nicht-rigide und nicht-kohasive Entitaten als Individuen zu reprasentieren. Zum zweiten war die Anzahl Individuen, welche die Sauglinge gleichzeitig reprasentieren konnten, klar begrenzt und grosse Kollektionen wurden als Substanz reprasentiert. Diese Ergebnisse erweitern die Sauglingsliteratur und zeigen bedeutsame Parallelen zur Reprasentation von Objekten und Substanzen im Erwachsenenalter auf, da auch Erwachsene Individuen primar aufgrund von raumzeitlicher Information generieren und die Anzahl Individuen, welche gleichzeitig reprasentiert werden konnen, begrenzt ist (vanMarle & Scholl, 2003).",

We are, in general, obliged to refrain from killing each and everyone. We do not have a similar obligation to try (or to continue to try) to prevent each and everyone from dying. In any case, to be morally obliged to persist in trying to prevent their deaths would be different from being morally obliged to refrain from killing all other people even if we had both obligations.",

This “lost life” is mostly too slow to be felt as life threatening, but once awakened to reality, it provokes the deepest of fears in patients: the fear of death itself and destruction of our mere existence. The horrible experience of having “lost life”, often without even noticing how it happened, can be turned into a strong motivation for improvement. Personal development is about finding the life deeply hidden within in order to induce revitalization and rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is about philosophy of life with the integration of the repressed painful feelings and emotions from the past and the letting go of the associated negative beliefs and decisions. The holistic medical toolbox builds on existential theories (the quality of life theories, the life mission theory, the theory of character, the theory of talent, and the holistic process theory) and seems to have the power to rehabilitate the purpose of life, the character of the person, and fundamental existential dimensions of man: (1) love; (2) strength of mind, feelings, and body; and 3) joy, gender, and sexuality; allowing the person once again to express and realize his talents and full potential. The principles of rehabilitation are not very different from other healing, but the task is often more demanding for the holistic physician as the motivation and resources often are very low and the treatment can take many years.",

(2) It is motivated by the human inclination for inquiry into the fundamental basis of being, whether human, social, or natural. (3) It is, theoretically at least, free from any types of dogmatic premises, whether traditional, social, or religious. (4) It requires a thoroughly logical and unequivocal usage of words and sentences. Likewise, although it has been and may still be defined by the existence or number of the absolute(s), be they god(s), spirit(s) or mental state(s), religion is, in most cases, expected to have the following characteristics: (1) Religion is a type of human beliefsystem or a product thereof. (2) It is motivated by the human inclination for ultimate reliance upon the absolute being or state. (3) It is, in practice, not completely free from some types of authoritative premises, whether traditional, customary, or founded by a certain individual.

      "title": "A crucial source of psychological certainty in human cognition: The certainty signature of central form",
      "abstract": "It has long been established that humans exhibit more psychological certainty than is justified (Burton 2009; Russell 1933). People feel certain about their most deeply held beliefs (e.g., their political beliefs), and their most distinctive memories (e.g., where they were on September 11th, 2001). The present paper proposes and tests another distinctive type of psychological certainty displayed by human beings. Namely, as people navigate the world, they encounter thousands of instances of kinds/categories at any moment (e.g., floors and walls, phones and watches, houses and gardens, pedestrians and students, coffee shops and universities, not to speak of small-scale entities, like cracks and crumbs, glints and glimmers). The present paper proposes that humans possess an initial expectation of psychological certainty that the entities they encounter will possess their form properties. Recent empirical work within cognitive science has provided evidence that human category representations possess a central form, a central structure which represents a few properties of the category as capturing its conceptual identity—e.g., what makes a watch a watch, what makes a house a house, what makes a student a student. For a watch, the central form represents properties like telling time and being portable. In Experiment 1, participants provided expectations about which properties would exist in new instances of kinds. They exhibited psychological certainty that form properties would exist in these instances, but they did not exhibit this certainty for other properties that were part of their generic knowledge of the kind. In Experiment 2, the same strong certainty belief was shown to be activated for a newly acquired kind concept, as soon as a property had been encoded as part of its central form. A wide range of consequences of this proposal are discussed, including for research on conceptual structure, stereotyping, and conceptual combination.",

      "title": "Influence of Spirituality on Quality of Life among Adults",
      "abstract": "The English word 'spirit' is derived from the Latin word 'spiritus' which means air, life or courage. Referring to this concept it may be said that spirituality is a way to discover the meaning of our life and to live with a faith that provides courage to face adverse circumstances. It is a subjective and elusive phenomenon that enables people to find out the reason of their existence. Many people confuse spirituality with religiosity but spirituality is a broader, overarching domain that may include religiosity, but religiosity is not a necessary element of spirituality (Cooper- Effa, Blount, Kaslow, Rothenberg, & Eckman, 2001 ; Estanek, 2006). Religion refers to the means and methods (i.e., rituals or prescribed behaviors) of the search that receive validation and support from within an identifiable group of people. According to Koenig, McCullough and Larson (2001) is the personal quest for understanding answers to ultimate questions about life, about meaning, and about relationship to the sacred or transcendent, which may (or may not) lead to or arise from the development of religious rituals and the formation of community. It may be said that spirituality is a set of beliefs and practices that can result in a life changing path that makes a person's life meaningful, purposeful. Spirituality has always been viewed as an important factor in realizing an adequate quality of life. Spirituality has been regarded as something that contributes to human flourishing, something that increase the quality of life. For instance Levin(2001) pointed out that spirituality engenders our emotions, thoughts, and beliefs that alleviate distress. Kass (1996) is one of the opinion that tapping one's spiritual core can boast self concept.It is difficult to point out that the term 'quality of life' is used by whom but the term got some references at 9th World Congress of Sociology held at Uppsala in the year 1978 (Szalai,1980;p.7).Quality of Life covers wider aspects of one's life like family, physical health, psychological health, social wellbeing, work etc. Quality of life is the feeling of overall life satisfaction, as determined by the mentally alert individual whose life is being evaluated (Meeberg, 1993, p. 37). The individual's subjective psychological outlook in the presence or absence of physiological and functional burden determines the individual's perceived quality of life (Burckhart & Anderson, 2003; Murdaugh, 1997). Quality of Life refers to a subjective evaluation which is embedded in a cultural, social and environmental context.Purpose of the studyThe present study was designed to assess the spirituality and quality of life of adults.Objectives of the study* To assess the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups;* To determine whether level of spirituality affects Quality of Life.Hypotheses of the study* There exists no significant difference between the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups.* There will be no significant effect of level of spirituality on Quality of Life.MethodParticipantsThe participants of this study was consisted of 60 adults selected from Aligarh city. The adult included the sample were in the age range of 35 to 45 years. The selection of the subjects was based on purposive sampling technique.InstrumentsDaily Spiritual Experiences Scale: It was constructed by Lynn G. Underwood & Jeanne A. Teresi was used. It is consist of 16 items to be rated on 6 point Likert scale ranging from many times a day, to never or almost never. The minimum and maximum scores that can be obtained on item 1 to 14 are 14 and 85 respectively.World Health Organization QOL Instrument: The scale developed by WHOQOL Group was administered. This scale is consists of 26 items that are distributed in four domains like physical, psychological, social relationship and environment. The scoring of domains are scaled in positive direction. …",

Besides, it also becomes both the help and the load for its owners in the hereafter. Nobody does not need wealth. Indeed, one ungrudgingfy goes early and comes in the dark time to earn the money. Ructions and losing of soul sometimes happened because of fighting over the wealth. Wealth is a tryout (slander) for human (Q.S. at-Tagabun: 15). Because of wealth one may enter into either the heaven or the hell.&#x0D; This article tries to discuss on the wealth based on the Qur'an. Based on the Quranic perspective, wealth is not merely a tool for satisfying for human needs, but it becomes a medium God mates for human in which it may become either comfort or curse for human being. Wealth, according to the Qur'an, has several functions. Firstly, it becomes a tryout (slander) for human, whether one will be grateful or vice versa. Secondly, it may also become mata' al-hayat ad-dunya (wordly fixings). Thirdly, it becomes wasilat al-jihad (means for jihad) for the owners.&#x0D; Key Words: wealth, slander, wordly fixings, means for jihad.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes we cannot benefit one person without harming, or failing to help, another; and where the cost to the other would be serious – where, for example, he would die – a substantial moral question is raised: would the benefit justify the harm? Some moralists would answer this question by balancing the good against the evil. But others deny that consequences are the only things of moral relevance. To them it also matters whether the harm comes from action, for example, from killing someone, or from inaction, for example, from not saving someone. They hold that for some good ends we might properly allow a certain evil to befall someone, even though we could not actively bring that evil about. Some people also see moral significance in the distinction between what we intend as a means or an end and what we merely foresee will result incidentally from our choice. They hold that in some situations we might properly bring about a certain evil if it were merely foreseen but not if it were intended.",

But he left less explored what makes stealth work. To provide an insight, Chapter 6 investigates the plural, situational, and interpersonal ways in which people understand legitimate, or at least reasonable, access to taking in the hunting zone. Stealth, I argue, is less a matter of efficient hiding than of cultivating skills that allow blending in across different social and bureaucratic landscapes and greater access to their own acquisitive and status-related projects. I call these skills camouflage, in a nod to their hunter-like, non-pastoral tendencies. Camouflage is not just something state actors do in order to paper over the inconvenient or anomalous cases that might call attention to the limits of state ways of seeing. It is a skill that people develop in order to move in and out of institutional structures, a way to use those structures for their own gymnastic endeavours without drawing attention to the ways in which their practices cause the bars to creak or bend.",

Human being is distinct part of this universe; So Universe and Human being are the elements of complementary to each other. Universe and its system are operating in an organized and integrated scientific manner. Nature creates compatible atmosphere for safety of human being.\r\nMaintaining the environment with its natural protection is in accordance with Islamic teachings, and human being is responsible to safety of the environment. Environment protection is an important aspect of Islam. Muslims is vicegerent of Allah on earth so Muslims are responsible to care for the environment in pro-active manner. Different species, be it plants or animals have been created for a specific purpose.\r\nThe Holy Quran provides comprehensive and clear teachings for protection of the environment and human survival. Holy Quran emphases man to live an eco-friendly, moderate, balanced and without causing any destruction or harm to nature. Allah says, in Holy Quran: (Qur’an, 2:60)   ولا تعثوا فى الارض مفسدين(Translation) “And do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.” \r\nAllah said in another place: ولا تبغ الفساد في الارض  ان الله لا يحب المفسدين  (Qur’an 28:77) “And do not desire corruption in the land. Indeed, God does not like corruptors.”\r\nHoly prophet Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him) took practical steps to keep the environment green and to ensure the protection of the environment. The holy prophet spent his entire life in helping and caring for mankind and also other creation of Allah, an eco-friendly effort, to restore/preserving the peace of the universe, planting trees and protecting the environment. Holy prophet Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him)says,  If a Muslim plants a tree or sows seeds, and then a bird, or a person or an animal eats from it, it is regarded as a charitable gift (sadaqah) for him.” \r\nOne of the biggest and most serious problem facing the world today is global warming, freshwater scarcity, depletion of biodiversity, ozone depletion. In this article describes the important elements of the environment, land, water, and types of air pollution. The reasons for polluting the environment are explained in the light of the facts. This paper is an attempt to briefly present the rules for the protection of the environment have been stated in the light of the verses of the holy Quran and the Hadith/Sunnah of the Prophet(peace be upon him),and the protection of human survival is one of the main goals of islamic Shari’ah.",

Manusia juga dibekali Tuhan akal pikiran untuk mempertahankan hidupnya dari segala macam rintangan dan cobaan. Akal pikiran inilah yang membedakan manusia berpikir, berbuat, berencana, menurut logika itulah manusia mampu menciptakan ilmu pengetahuan modern. Dengan akal pikiran manusia dapat membedakan yang baik dan yang buruk tentang segala tindakan yang akan dilakukannya. Perilaku manusia sangat dipengaruhi oleh cara berpikir mereka terhadap apa yang sedang mereka hadapi. Didalam Al-Qur’an sebagian manusia ada yang dicintai dan dibenci oleh Allah swt.\r\nMemperhatikan suasana kini, sebagian umat Islam hidup rukun dan damai dan sebagian yang lain hidup terzalimi, dan banyak di antara tetangga-tetangganya yang kurang memperhatikan. Demikian pula sebagian lain terpecah-pecah, kurang terdorong untuk bersatu ataupun memantapkan di lingkungan mereka. Adapula sebagian lagi yang sering mengkritisi, mencaci, ataupun melakukan tindakan-tindakan tidak terpuji. Semua keyakinan, ucapan, ataupun amalan yang diperintahkan oleh Allah dan Rasul-Nya, baik yang sifatnya wajib maupun sunnah, semuanya dicintai dan diridhai oleh Allah. Sebaliknya, semua keyakinan, ucapan ataupun amalan yang dilarang dan bertentangan dengan syari’at, maka itu semuanya dibenci Allah swt.\r\nPenelitian ini bersifat kepustakaan yang didasarkan pada Al-Qurˈān sebagai sumber primer dan buku-buku lainnya yang terkait dengan tema ini sebagai sumber data sekunder. Adapun data-data yang dibutuhkan dalam penyelesaian penelitian ini diperoleh dengan menggunakan teknik dokumentasi yaitu menghimpun literatur-literatur yang berkaitan dengan objek penelitian penulis yaitu tentang orang-orang yang dicintai dan dibenci oleh Allah swt. Sementara metode yang digunakan untuk mengolah data dalam penelitian ini adalah dengan menggunakan metode tematik. yaitu mengelompokkan ayat sesuai dengan turunnya ayat Al-Qur’an, menggunakan asbāb al-nuzūl, mengelompokkan ayat-ayat yang telah ditemukan berdasarkan Makkiyah dan Madaniyah, dan menggunakan kitab-kitab tafsir untuk memperjelas kajiannya.\r\nDari penelitian ini ditemukan informasi, bahwa ada 35 ayat Al-Qur’an yang menyebutkan siapa saja yang Allah sukai dari hamba-hambanya yang beriman. Di antara orang-orang yang dicintai Allah ialah yaitu orang-orang yang berbuat baik, orang-orang yang bertobat dan menyucikan diri, orang-orang yang berbuat kebajikan, orang-orang yang adil, orang-orang yang bertawakkal, orang-orang yang bertakwa, orang-orang yang sabar, dan orang-orang yang beriman. Adapun konsekuensi orang-orang yang dicintai Allah yaitu akan mendapat pahala dan ganjaran di akhirat tidak lain adalah surga. Dan Ada 27 ayat dalam Al-Qur’an yang menyebutkan siapa saja orang-orang yang dibenci oleh Allah antara lain yaitu: orang-orang yang melampaui batas, orang-orang kafir, orang-orang zalim, orang-orang sombong dan membanggakan diri, orang-orang yang berkhianat, orang-orang yang membuat kerusakan, dan orang-orang yang berlebih-lebihan.

      "title": "Performance is Dissolution",
      "abstract": "Dissolution. Dissolution. Yes; it sounds a bit pessimistic, like the end of a marriage, the break up of a rock band, or the ruin of a company. It does not sound like something one would submit oneself to voluntarily, or like an appropriate scholarly goal. Still, I think there is something to dissolution as a metaphor: something sticky, something syrupy, and something close. So I turn (as I do in such times of metaphoric grasping) to denotation, to the ease of literality. According to Merriam-Webster Online (2009), dissolution is: “the act or process of dissolving, as a: separation into component parts b: (1) decay, disintegration; (2) death; c: termination or destruction by breaking down, disrupting, or dispersing ; d: the dissolving of an assembly or organization; e: liquefaction” (“Dissolution”). Wow. Okay, I grant that most of this definition leaves us in the realm of gloom and doom. Dissolution, it seems, is all about decomposition. How can performance, which is seemingly all about composition, also be dissolution? Mostly because hanging on the edge of the definition is just the something I had in mind, that is: “liquefaction” (“Dissolution,” 2009). Here is the sticky, syrupy, close meaning for which I was grasping. With this denotative glue I have a place to dive in, to get my feet wet, to, well, find a suitable solution. What does it mean to dissolve or be dissolved? Remember science class? Some solids (like sugar) become incorporated when they encounter liquids (like water). It is a process with which we are familiar, but is it really a useful metaphor? Perhaps it is more accurately an analogy, a process akin to performance to which we can look for heuristic clues. To drive my metaphor I need a more precise vehicle. When I think about dissolution the first thing that comes to mind is Kool-Aid, that magical liquid sugar I drank too much of as a kid, that colorful nectar that gave me a tell-tale Kool-Aid grin. (I also think about the instant coffee I resort to now in times of utter desperation, but that is a vehicle of a more depressing sort.) The melting of those crystals is a performance in itself, but for what tenor is Kool-Aid a vehicle? What is it that gets dissolved in the swirling water of performance? Just as the properties of particular water combined with those of particular KoolAid crystals determine the flavor of the drink, the contextual properties of performance combined with those of specific audience(s) and performer(s) create the flavor",

      "title": "The Economic Value of Water",
      "abstract": "In economics, the value of an item—including water—to a person is defined as the most of something else of value (typically money, but sometimes time) the person is willing to give up to obtain that item (willingness to pay) or the minimum compensation the person would want to receive in exchange for forgoing the item (willingness to accept). These are measures of gross value; they are in principle quantitative; and they are subjective and idiosyncratic to the individual and the circumstances. The economic value of an item is not measured by its price. It is likely to vary with the amount of the item and should not be taken as a constant. A core conceptual distinction is between use value and nonuse value. A person’s use value for an item is the value that she places on the item from motives connected with the use of the item by someone, whether her own use or that of someone else. Nonuse value is the value she places on an item from motives not directly connected with the use of that item by anybody in any tangible way. For example, a person may value water to drink (a use value), but he may also value having water remain in its natural state (a nonuse value). Consumptive uses are use values, but nonconsumptive uses can also be use values (e.g., swimming in a lake). Other conceptual distinctions include that between wet water and paper water (water that exists on paper but is not actually accessible or usable), and that between raw water alone versus water accompanied by the infrastructure necessary to store it and convey it so as to make it available for use.",

We evaluate how a person fares at a particular moment when we say that he is doing well just then. We favor different idioms in these two kinds of evaluation: we are more inclined to speak of a person as having a good life than as having a good moment; and, conversely, we are more inclined to use the terms ‘welfare’ or ‘well-being’ to express how well things are going for him at a particular moment than to evaluate how well his life goes as a whole.",

      "abstract": "Admittedly, reasons might be given for such constraints on moral or legal grounds—for example, that obscenity causally affects the behavior of its readers, as in a connection between the reading of pornography and certain crimes; or that obscenity is addictive, capturing unsuspecting viewers or readers and bending them to its will. Were the social dangers posed by these transactions really a matter for concern, surely the attempt should first be made to understand the conditions that foster them. For unless interest in obscenity is assumed to be innate, a trait of human nature, there should be an explanation for it in the variable conditions (the repressions—or, perhaps, on the other hand, the creative impulses) that impinge on the more authentic and so non-prurient traits of human nature. It's too bad—probably—that people find (or feel obliged to find) gratification in obscenity. Better, no doubt, the reality than surrogate; much better, obviously, to quarrel with cause of a malady than with symptom.",

This includes especially general unrest, a mood of crisis and readiness to panic. In a mass of humanity all requisites for the development of a panic are present. This can develop acutely, as a weak abortive failure, but it may also be chronic. Measures to prevent or control panic may only be successful if they take into consideration the genesis and nature of individually varied panics.",

      "abstract": "Actus Non Facit Reum, Nisi Mens Sit Rea` is a Latin maxim that means that an act does not make the person guilty unless the mind is also guilty.1 This particular maxim identifies the two important elements necessary to convict of the crime committed. The two important elements are Mens Rea and Actus Reus, with the mental and physical elements involved, respectively. For a person to be legally responsible for an act, criminal intent is required, and therefore the ability of the perpetrator to establish criminal intent is a relevant consideration in determining the person's criminal responsibility. However, due to immaturity of age or lack of mental faculties, an individual may not have sufficient mental faculties to form a criminal intent. When such a defect is caused by mental illness, a person is said to be insane. A person who has a natural handicap to differentiate between right and wrong or good and bad, such as young children under a certain age, idiots, crazy, therefore is not punishable. Stephen states in his Compilation of Criminal Law that “no act is a crime if the person who does it, is at the same time when it is done prevented either by defective mental power or by any disease affecting his mind from knowing the nature and quality of the act or from knowing that the act is wrong”.2 Over the years, the defence of the insane has developed through various precedents and laws. The McNaughton case, dating back to the 19th century, marks a milestone in the defence of insanity. The principle or rule in McNaughton's case is a legendary principle related to the defence of insanity.",

To conserve, in this sense, is to protect, as far as possible, from further deterioration or damage. ‘Conservation’ is closely associated with ‘restoration’ but the terms have different meanings and different connotations in professional circles. To conserve something is to protect it; to restore it is to return it to an earlier state. Yet these can often seem to merge. To clean a painting, removing dirt and stains, could be described as restoring it to an earlier state but would usually be considered as conservation not restoration, while to clean the painting and remove later re-painting not by the original artist would count as restoration.",

In the context of psychophysical well-being, if an impure person, such as a khame or a blacksmith, were to be allowed into a household, thus polluting and angering the guardian deity, the latter might withdraw its protection over the household members; this would make the five constituting elements of an individual vulnerable to harassment by malicious forces, resulting in illnesses and personal misfortunes.

The mats suggest possible use (i.e. exercise) while at the same time functioning as platforms for small collections of purpose-made objects which resemble body parts and yoga/exercise paraphernalia. These collections of parts resemble tools, limbs and artifacts. They might appear to enable certain types of activity, in the way that a yoga block might invite a certain type of yoga position, but they are also of course simply discrete sculptural objects. These units, i.e. the ‘mats’ and the other elements that they display, are both objects and subjects. The mats allude to human bodies and serve as supports for non-human bodies.\r\n\r\nThe series of mats and accompanying objects will be placed and removed according to the availability of the space (sometimes occupied by chairs/church service). The work will act as a temporal event. It’s this durational aspect that pushes them more towards the space of performance and event, liveness. The work will appear and disappear, ebb/flow in sync with the day-to-day use of the shared multifunctional space. As such the work makes use of gaps in time and space, and while there’s a sinister aspect to this sort of occupying of seemingly empty time/space with productivity (especially productivity which relates in part to the optimized performance of the body), there’s also an element of gymnastic adaptation, a pragmatic and nomadic approach to inhabiting space and through this there’s a desire to find spaces within existing structures where one can exist, where one can do as one pleases.\r\n\r\nThe mats might collectively allude to a social group, a body, individual bodies and the group’s body – a body that will be taken care of by Matthew Wang. Matthew will place and clear away the mats at regular intervals, with direction from myself.

Conspicuous consumption has been analyzed as a primitive form of exchange by Mauss, M., and has been mentioned repeatedly in the intellectual lineage of Bataille, G., Baudrillard, J., et al. This action is concerned with the acquisition of social status in order to save one's own face, and shows what forms the depth-psychological base stratum in the \"class system\" of human beings, as well as illuminating the \"social functions of dignity and class distribution.\" We have discovered a continuous course from the psychogenic experiences occurring at the onset and previously considered trifling and therefore ignored, proceeding to the symptoms and to the structure of the symptoms.

      "title": "A Genealogy of the Sin of Sloth - or Why We Neglect Social and Economic Rights (La Paresse du Droit ou Pourquoi Neglige-t-on les Droits Sociaux et Economiques)",
      "abstract": "This paper argues that the sin of sloth (acedia), as understood by the Christian tradition, has been replaced by its opposite in the modern world. Sloth, according to Aquinas, is the sin of the soul that does not act for the good in itself, that does not act out of love for God, but rather, that acts merely on the basis of fear or out of a desire to gain benefits. The slothful person was the one who acted (or did not act...) according to his or her own calculated interests instead of acting according to his or her telos. Thus, total inaction from the slothful sinner came from his or her belief that he or she was lost and that nothing he or she could do could save him or her. Inaction was thus considered incidental to, a mere symptom of, one's dispersion of will. The modern conception of sloth tends to reverse this scheme by focusing instead on the unresponsiveness to incentives. Not following one's telos appears to have nothing to do with the modern conception of sloth. Inaction is considered rational if an agent is not subject to appropriate incentives to act (i.e. the potential to gain benefits or avoid losses through action). In effect, acting without the appropriate incentives only means spending irrationally one's energies, it means being wasteful. At the opposite, inaction is considered slothful when the agent does not take positive steps to materialise potential gains or to avoid potential losses. The structure of modern law reflects the inversion of meaning that struck sloth when we moved from the Medieval man to the homo economicus. This inversion of meaning explains to a large extent the attitude that a majority of jurists have about social and economic rights: if those rights are not justiciable, they are not real rights, they impose no duty, people are thus not bound by them, thus, they are not real law. Through a genealogy of the sin of sloth, this paper offers a criticism of this dominant mode of legal thinking.",

Mortality is the yard-stick and survivors merely the fraction that did not die. After an arbitrarily selected interval the experimental material is categorized as dead or alive, with sometimes an intermediate group such as “subnormal” inserted. This third class is often essential, for its members do not properly qualify as dead or alive, terms that imply totality. It is also a nuisance, for several reasons: (1) it blends gradually into the other two categories so that classification itself is subject to errors of judgment; (2) its numerical uncertainty affects the other categories not only at the time of initial classification but also later by the death or total recovery of some of its members; (3) as long as any treatment-effect persists, the situation remains quantitatively incomplete.",

      "abstract": "According to some theists, God will never completely destroy moral evil or banish it from his creation entirely; instead, he will eventually confine moral evil to a specific region of his creation, a region known as hell, and those condemned to hell, having no hope of escape from it, will live out eternity in a state of estrangement from God as well as from each other. Let us call that the traditional doctrine of hell. Elsewhere I have argued that any form of theism which includes such a doctrine, even one that tries to preserve consistency by denying the universal love of God, is in fact logically inconsistent. But moderately conservative theists, as I have called them, have an argument for the traditional doctrine that some have found convincing, one that emphasizes libertarian free will. The argument is this. Because God is perfectly loving, he wills the good for every created person and wills the redemption of all who have fallen into evil; but because he has also given his loved ones the gift of freedom and some of them in fact exercise their freedom to reject him forever, it is simply not within his power, even as an omnipotent being, to redeem all of those who fall into evil. According to moderately conservative theists, therefore, the following hypothesis, which I shall call the Rejection Hypothesis (RH), is at least possibly true: (RH) Some persons will, despite God's best efforts to save them, freely and irrevocably reject God and thus separate themselves from God forever.",

      "abstract": "Virtue, the conscious recognition of a moral law and the conscious and deliberate conformity to it, is not the consummation of character. There is something still higher. The law of the spiritual life is not truly the law of the soul until wrought into the nature itself. Then virtue becomes the second nature. The man no longer by deliberate acts of the will conforms to a standard external to himself; he is not subject to law, but is himself an embodied law; becomes a law unto himself; does whatever he pleases because he pleases to do whatever is right. Thus, in that spiritual evolution which constitutes redemption, man passes through three stages: in the first he is lawless but innocent, and in his ignorance of the law he is controlled by his animal impulses; in the second stage he recognizes the higher law of his nascent divine nature, and endeavors to conform his life and character to it; in the third stage this law has become the law of his being, and he lives in peace and liberty, because his impulses have themselves become spiritual impulses. The first stage is innocence; the second is virtue; the third is holiness.",

      "title": "Outsider Architecture: the Literary Constructions of Eve Langley",
      "abstract": "Outsider architecture references a continuum of unofficial constructions, from the tenuous envelope of found materials that a homeless person folds about themselves nightly, to the compellingly precarious sculptural artefact, painstakingly but illegally built, in a front garden or on public land. One way that the homeless deal with their vulnerability to harsh weather, psychological disturbance and lack of privacy is the construction of ad hoc shelters from found objects and recycled rubbish. These shelters represent one form of outsider architecture. Roger Cardinal notes that another form is the idiosyncratic construction of sculptural assemblages, also, typically from recycled materials, to form architectural structures, modified dwellings, landscaped areas, collections, monuments and shrines that seem to pop up in most cities, or anywhere there are people (169). All over the world, homeless people seek to provide at least temporary shelter for themselves, and at the same time, a certain number of people, sometimes the same people, engage in personal projects of construction in which the expression of individuality is as, if not more, important than physical containment or shelter. \r\nThis article will consider the work of one author, Eve Langley, as a form of outsider architecture and will suggest that the physical entity formed by Langley’s novels, as a manifestation of outsider architecture, provided their author with the hope of psychic shelter when she wrote them. Langley wrote at a time in which it was difficult for a woman to succeed as an artist, or to support herself financially. As well, she experienced a dysfunctional marriage and suffered from uncertain health. Despite these difficult conditions, she wrote compulsively, sending manuscripts, one after another to her publishers, long after they had stopped publishing her work. \r\nYet, the large body of unpublished manuscripts in the Mitchell speaks of more than the mental ill health that is frequently associated with Langley. Consideration of the debates active within the literary community of New Zealand at the time Langley was writing, and the nature and content of, in particular, her novelistic oeuvre, suggests that Langley may have been writing at least partly in response to local literary voices. Despite her peripatetic lifestyle and solipsistic tendencies, Langley was part of the community of writers living in New Zealand in the mid-twentieth century. Her writing was supported and criticised by it, and undoubtedly shaped by it. This article will consider the part this community played in Langley’s writing, the dual aspects of vulnerability and strength, feelings of alienation and centrality, exhibited in Langley’s authorial choices. By examining Langley’s body of work through the lens of outsider architecture, Langley’s prolific literary output in the face of a largely negative reception may be seen, not so much as the sign of a loss of control, but as a strategic, if eccentric, construction of an authorial presence.",

      "abstract": "Greek tragedy shows good people being ruined because of things that just happen to them, things that they do not control. This is certainly sad; but it is an ordinary fact of human life, and no one would deny that it happens. Nor does it threaten any of our deeply held beliefs about goodness, since goodness, plainly, can persist unscathed through a change in external fortunes. Tragedy also, however, shows something more deeply disturbing: it shows good people doing bad things, things otherwise repugnant to their ethical character and commitments, because of circumstances whose origin does not lie with them. Some such cases are mitigated by the presence of direct physical constraint or excusable ignorance. In those cases we may feel satisfied that the agent has not actually acted badly – either because he or she has not acted at all, or because (as in the case of Oedipus) the thing he intentionally did was not the same as the bad thing that he inadvertently brought about. But the tragedies also show us, and dwell upon, another more intractable sort of case – one which has come to be called, as a result, the situation of ‘tragic conflict’. In such cases we see a wrong action committed without any direct physical compulsion and in full knowledge of its nature, by a person whose ethical character or commitments would otherwise dispose him to reject the act. The constraint comes from the presence of circumstances that prevent the adequate fulfillment of two valid ethical claims.",

      "title": "Clothing",
      "abstract": "Clothing refers to skins or garments made from the manipulation of fibers or threads (i.e., woven, knitted, sprang, etc.), which cover the body in some manner. Adornment is another relevant term and refers to the temporary ornamentation of the body for a given occasion or event. It thus calls attention primarily to aesthetic qualities. The terms clothing and adornment almost inevitably introduce personal or social values. Hence, recently, scholars have opted for the broader term dress. Clothing is more specific than dress, which includes not only bodily coverings, but also jewelry, cosmetics, hairstyles, tattoos, or other manipulations of the bodily surface such as scarification. Dress is both noun and verb, or, put differently, both product and process. Dress as a noun is what is done to the body, and dress as a verb is how it is done. This article includes studies that address all three areas. The study of clothing has developed considerably in a number of disciplines. For historians, it began as a history of costume but has since evolved to include insights from social scientific fields such as anthropology and sociology. The latter two areas as well as other disciplines now boast a significant number of theoretical approaches to clothing and dress, examining them in light of identity (gender, religious, ethnic, cultural, political), power, embodiment, and how it functions as a communicator of subjective and social values, including notions of the self. Beyond its importance as a material artifact, dress has also been recognized as a reflection of mentifacts (values and beliefs that shape culture) and sociofacts (institutions and norms that direct human behavior). Moreover, the study of fashion and its significance for the study of contemporary culture, especially in light of Western commoditization, has emerged as a major area of interdisciplinary research. In Classics, analysis of dress has also witnessed a considerable upsurge in the last decade and deems it important for the study of societies, such as ancient Rome, in which “the gaze” is so important. Given the highly ideological nature of much of the ancient writing about clothing, archaeological studies and examinations of artistic remains are requisite. Such work must also remember, however, that art can be rhetorical, just as texts are. Of fundamental importance is the observation that items of clothing and ornamentation held tremendous material value in the ancient world, whether it is the Ancient Near East or the Greco-Roman context, and thus their economic, technological, trade, and social dimensions must be highlighted. The study of clothing in the Bible, ancient Judaism, and early Christianity is in its early stages. In biblical literature, symbolic and literal references to clothing, and dress in general, abound. Items of clothing take on legal, ritual, technical, and theological meanings in some biblical texts, while in others they serve as literary markers or motifs that underscore larger shifts within various narratives. In the New Testament and other early Christian literature, clothing imagery continues to convey theological and political meanings; it can function as a means of vilifying characters by associating them with luxurious dress, and it can assist in creating and maintaining identity.",

Inreflecting common uses of the word ‘pollution’ the definition also reflects the different, and sometimes competing, rationales for its regulation. Thus, on the one hand, it indicates that by ‘pollution’ some are put in mind principally of what, in affecting the natural world, does harm to humans (and speciically to their ‘health’, and to the ‘legitimate uses of’ and the ‘living resources’ and ‘amenity’ they find in the environment). On the other hand, however, it recognises that others use ‘pollution’ to describe not only what adversely affects humans through affecting the environment, but to describe in addition what, quite simply, adversely affects the environment; thus there is reference to harm not only to ‘living resources’ but also to ‘ecological systems’, and to damage not just to ‘amenity’, but also to ‘structures’ (not, as it might have been, ‘structures of value to humans’).",

      "title": "ENDING LIFE",
      "abstract": "In the Foundation of the Metaphysics of Morals Kant asks himself whether a person may, in certain circumstances, take his life when he judges that his continued existence is humanly pointless. Surprisingly, the great apostle of personal autonomy holds that such a person would be acting immorally. Kant argues that one contemplating suicide is caught in a ‘contradiction’ in that he is, on the one hand, concerned to promote his self-interest by seeking to escape further suffering or dying in a situation where he has lost control over himself and become a ‘vegetable’; but on the other hand he wishes, by taking his life, to abolish his ‘self’ and all possibility of securing his future self-interest. Since what is contradictory is irrational, suicide is irrational. Kant also develops another argument to the effect that a person deciding to commit suicide sees the taking of his life as a means to an end (the cessation of suffering, the avoidance of an ‘undignified’ death). He no longer sees himself as an autonomous moral agent (or person) deserving of absolute moral respect, or as an ‘end-in-itself’, as Kant puts it, that can never legitimately be used simply as a means. Instead, he treats himself as a thing that can be used for other purposes. The would-be suicide is then, for Kant, guilty of a lack of self-respect. Kant's conclusion appears to be that if it is not morally permissible for me to end my life under any circumstances, I have an absolute obligation to preserve my life.",

First, I show that moral properties like being morally good or bad, being obligatory or forbidden, are properties specific to some kind of entity which is human action; accordingly, the nature of moral properties is determined by ontological properties of human action. Then I present some of these ontological properties: the distinction of human actions from human artifacts, technical procedures, states of aff airs, events and processes; the nature of distinction of kinds of human actions; and the criteria of succeeding in human action as opposed to technical succeeding. Finally, I contrast kinds of technical procedures which are always technically bad but can be undertaken in a good human action and kinds of human action which are always morally bad, and therefore must never be done.",

      "abstract": "1. The discussion starts with four propositions: (1) that we are bound to think about religion; (2) that the usual result of thinking about religion is to naturalize it; (3) that religion resists being naturalized; (4) that we cannot let religion go. 2. Starting from the fundamental experience of religion, viz, worship, it is discovered that worship (1) secures freedom, by breaking through the determinisms of habit, mood, and thought; (2) promotes the meeting of minds in such a way as to make differences of view fruitful instead of merely combative. 3. Although worship promotes useful ends in human social life, it must not be made a mere means to a utilitarian end. It demands a metaphysical object of worship. To leave religion with merely psychological attitudes or social task is illicitly to naturalize it. The object of worship must be worthy of worship; it must be God. 4. The existence of evil is the chief obstacle to objective worship. The refusal to be content to let evil remain an unexplained fact in the universe involves an attempt to see it in other relations. There is an implicit or explicit appeal to a reality transcending our experience of evil. Realism refuted. 5. The possibility of worship is thus opened. But the justification of worship depends on the validity of the experience of the mystics. The prospect in this direction.",

      "abstract": "Survival depends upon the ability to recognize potential predators and competitors for scarce resources such as food, water and a safe resting place. Survivors also must be capable of elaborating appropriate aversive motivational states that support behaviors which result in (1) escape from a source of noxious and potentially life-threatening stimulation, (2) avoidance of stimuli that have in the past been associated with noxious stimulation, or (3) removal of a source of potentially noxious stimulation by aggression. All three require the activation of motivational states that are often call affective reactions (even though most investigators in this field find it difficult to define the term without reference to specific instances). It is important to note that under normal circumstances, these affective reactions are triggered by stimuli in the environment, external to the organism. Aversive motivation differs in this important respect from appetitive motivational states which are based on changes in the internal environment (although such external stimuli as the sight and smell of food do, of course, interact with the internal milieu and may, under some circumstances provide adequate stimulation of appetitive behavior).KeywordsLimbic SystemMotivational StateAggressive ReactionAffective ReactionSeptal LesionThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

It is therefore a badly chosen form of speech to say, that under certain circumstances a body attains an affinity which under other circumstances it loses. This expression can only be understood to mean, that at one time the bodies are enabled to follow the attraction ff their chemical forces, whilst at another they are prevented from so doing by other forces acting in an opposite direction. These opposite attractions, which must be overcome in order that the chemical combination should take place, may he presented to the mind under the image of a resistance similar to that occurring in friction, in the passage of electricity through conductors, in the distribution of magnetism in steel, or in the conduction of heat. We overcome this resistance when we quicken the formation of a precipitate by agitation, or when, by increase of temperature, by catalytic action, or by insolation, we cause a chemical action to occur. Such a resistance to combination presupposes a certain combining power, the magnitude of which is measured by the mass of the body chemically combined in the unit of time under the influence of the unit of force.",

      "abstract": "Locke's Account of Inheritance and Bequest J. J. WALDRON 1. WHEN A MAN DIES, what should become of his property? Do his property rights die with him, leaving his goods, his wealth, ownerless or do the rights survive his death in some form or other? If the rights die with him, then presumably his goods become fair game for anybody to appropriate just as if they had never been owned at all. But if the rights survive, then posthumous appropriation will amount to theft---either against the dead man himself or against some other person in whom the rights have been vested as a result of the death. To a certain extent, one's views on what ought to happen to a man's property after his death will depend on one's conception of death itself: Is it regarded merely as a transition to another realm or is it the terminus of all individual existence? If death is not regarded as a final end, it may be thought that a deceased's goods should be burned or buried with him in order to consign them to that state of existence which he himself has attained. In this case, posthumous appropriation by another is a violation of the rights of the deceased--at least as grievous a violation as stealing from him while he is alive. In Western philosophical thought, despite a very widespread belief in a life after death, an individual's property rights have usually been regarded as confined to the temporal phase of his existence. The dominant belief in post-mortem survival has been Christian, and Christian teaching has it that there is no possibility of taking material wealth or any of its benefits beyond the grave. The custom of interring some property (clothes, casket, flag, weapon) with a deceased is attributable more to a sense of decent ceremony than to a belief that these goods will be of any use to him in the hereafter. The alternatives in Western thought, then, are either the complete annihilation of personal property rights by death or else the vesting of the rights of a dead man in some other person, i One might have expected that someone like John Locke, who justified private property on the basis of an individual's personal investment of labor, would opt for the former alternative. If a right of property is essentially earned by an individual, .then one would expect that right to die with the man who earned it. To vest the earner's fight in I am gratefulto ProfessorAlanMusgrave,of the Universityof Otago, New Zealand, and to the anonymous referees of the Journal of the History of Philosophy for their helpful adviceand criticisms. LLeibniz is supposed to have believed that the immortalsoul of a deceased proprietor had a continuing right, after death, to have its wishes carried out: see W. G. Miller, Lectures on the Philosophy of Law London:(CharlesGriffen& Co., 1884),pp. 257-58. However,Millergivesno indicationwherein Leibniz's works this referenceis to be found. [391 40 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY somebody else as a result of his death would amount to the creation of an unearned right of property--a right not arising from the investment of the labor of the person purporting to hold it. Succession, therefore, would undermine the justification of property entitlements on the basis of labor. At death, according to the purest version of this kind of theory, there should be no succession, no bequest, and no inheritance. Property would return to the state of nature when its owner died and remain there till some other individual came along and mixed his labor with it. Locke, however, did not take this view. In the First Treatise of Government (which contains his most extensive discussion of these matters), Locke wrote: But if any one had began and made himself a Property in any particular thing, (which how he, or any one else, could do, shall be shewn in another place) that thing, that possession, if he dispos'd not otherwise of it by his positive Grant, descended Naturally to his Children, and they had a right to succeed to it, and possess it.2 The parenthetical reference is...",

The potential liabilities are: empathy-induced altruism can hurt those in need, especially when the helper needs a cool head; it may also produce maternalism and paternalism; empathy-induced altruism can be overridden by self-concern; it can produce empathy avoidance; empathy-induced altruism is less likely to be evoked by non-personal, abstract, and chronic needs; empathy-induced altruism can be a source of immoral action; it can also pose a threat to the common good in social dilemmas. Finally, empathy-induced altruism can pose a threat to the mental and physical health—and even to the life—of the altruistically motivated individual.",

      "abstract": "Maximizing Prudent Behavior (practicing the Virtue of Prudence) is what Smith means by the concept of self-interest (caring for one’s self). The primacy of the virtue of Prudence was established by Aristotle based on earlier discussions by Plato. All of the other major founders of different systems of virtue ethics (for example, Confucius or Buddha or Aquinas) have emphasized prudence, since it is not possible to give anything to anyone else if you have not been successful in attaining income or financial resources yourself. There can thus never be any conflict between Self-interest (Prudence) and Benevolence (Beneficence), since these virtues deal with different situations confronted by a follower of virtue ethics at different times in their lives. Applying the virtue of Beneficence can only possibly occur after the practice of prudence has been implemented successfully. There will always be a significant lag in time during which the prudent individual has been successful in attaining financial resources and circumstances occurring which will allow him/her to later practice beneficence. Only after they have successfully attained significant financial resources through prudent behavior will they be in a position to practice benevolence (beneficence). Smith would have considered it obvious that the baker, brewer and butcher had to practice the virtue of prudence first, and be successful, before that could practice the virtue of benevolence (beneficence) second.",

      "title": "<i>Mind, Brain, and Free Will</i>",
      "abstract": "Anyone familiar with his work over the past fifty years knows that ‘Richard Swinburne’ means systematicity, and his latest contribution, Mind, Brain, and Free Will, fits the mold. In this ambitious work, Swinburne aims to defend two of the most controversial, and often derided, theories in philosophy of mind and action: substance dualism and agent-causation. Swinburne defends a host of provocative claims, though I suspect the following six will be of most interest to readers: (i) mental properties and events are distinct from and do not supervene on physical properties and events; (ii) a human being is a pure mental substance, having only its soul as an essential part; (iii) souls and bodies causally interact; (iv) no experimental results do or could show that our intentions never cause any brain events; (v) in intentional causation, the cause is the mental substance who has the intention, not events involving the agent; (vi) human beings often exercise free will in what they do (that is, we are not causally determined) and thus we are often morally responsible for what we do, deserving blame for doing what we believe wrong and praise for doing what we believe goes beyond our obligations.Chapters 1 and 2 set out the general metaphysical and epistemological framework for Swinburne's subsequent arguments. The rigor, clarity, and systematicity of these chapters is most impressive. Two of his most important claims are that logical possibility entails metaphysical possibility when the terms used in the relevant sentences are informative rigid designators, and that (absent defeaters) we are justified in believing what seems to us to be the case (he calls this “the principle of credulity” (42)). An informative rigid designator of a substance, property, or event picks out the same substance, property, or event in every world and tells us fully which substance, property, or event that it refers to (10). Unlike natural kind terms, which are noninformative rigid designators and thus such that a competent language user may not know fully what substance these terms refer to, he contends that designators like ‘red’ or ‘apparently seeing a desk’ are such that any competent language user knows full well what properties or events they refer to (13).Chapter 3 puts this distinction to work, arguing that mental properties (properties we have privileged access to) are not identical to physical properties and mental events are not identical to physical events, and concludes by cataloging which mental properties/events are pure (whose instantiation or occurrence does not entail the instantiation or occurrence of any contingent physical property/event). Beliefs, desires, thoughts, intentions, and sensations are all pure mental events (2).In chapter 4, Swinburne argues that no one could ever be justified in believing epiphenomenalism, and since it seems that mental events very often cause physical events, they probably do (100–101). This argument is, as far as I know, wholly original and in my estimation brilliant—one of the most important contributions of the book. Given property dualism, Swinburne assumes epiphenomenalism entails that the physical is causally closed: that all physical effects insofar as they have causes only have physical causes (call this ‘CCP’). While he considers and rebuts both a priori and a posteriori arguments for CCP, his real contribution comes in showing that we cannot possibly be justified in believing CCP. To simplify, the argument runs as follows: any evidence for CCP requires the belief that the mental causes the physical. For example, psychological and neuroscientific experiments depend on the testimony of participants concerning their mental life. But we are justified in accepting their testimony only if we are justified in believing that the participants' testimony is partly caused by their beliefs concerning their mental life. If we have no reason to think that their beliefs about, for example, when they became aware of their intentions, partly caused their reports to the experimenters, then we would have no reason to trust their reports. Thus any evidence for CCP requires us to assume the falsity of CCP.Chapter 5 turns its focus to agent-causation, taking up issues about causation, powers, and laws of nature. Swinburne rejects Humean accounts of causation and laws since they render causation and laws far more extrinsic than we normally think, and he rejects the relations-between-universals account since the substance-powers-and-liabilities account (SPL) is simpler and equally well explains causation and the laws of nature. According to SPL, the fundamental laws are regularities in the causal powers and liabilities of substances. Causation then consists in substances exercising causal powers. From this, Swinburne immediately infers “Contrary to Hume and Lewis…it is then not an event which causes another event; but a substance or substances which cause an event. It is not the momentum of the brick but the brick itself which causes the glass window at which it is thrown to break” (131).While it does seem natural to infer the existence of irreducible substance causation from SPL, not all do. For example, Mumford and Anjum (2011, 1) also accept SPL, but contend that while substances are “involved” in causation, it is “properties that do the causal work.” Unfortunately, Swinburne offers no elaboration or defense of this putative entailment. Furthermore, he fails to consider any of the many well-known objections to the very possibility of agent-causation, leaving his defense of agent-causation rather thin.In chapter 6, Swinburne contends that human beings are pure mental substances, substances whose only essential part is the soul. His argument rests on the putative failure of materialist accounts to provide adequate conditions for synchronic and diachronic identity. As far as I can tell, there is no significant difference between this and earlier presentations of his argument and so I skip over it.Chapters 7 and 8 turn to questions about the nature of, and relationship between, free will and moral responsibility. Swinburne defends a restrictivist account of free will, where we exercise free will (defined as “acting intentionally without their intentions being fully determined by prior causes” [202]) only when we are motivationally conflicted. The main argument of chapter 7 is that we have no current scientific data against this conception of free will and we are unlikely ever to acquire any. Chapter 8 provides a sketch of the nature of moral responsibility and a fascinating, if ultimately underdeveloped, argument for incompatibilism about moral responsibility. He contends that incompatibilist criteria for moral responsibility—that agents have free will and the relevant moral beliefs—can explain all the true moral principles and judgments about particular cases in a simpler fashion than any rival compatibilist theory. We ought, then, to accept incompatibilism since it is simpler than compatibilism but equally explanatorily powerful. Swinburne uses Derk Pereboom's (2001) four-case manipulation argument to illustrate how compatibilists must embrace ad hoc criteria for moral responsibility, rendering their accounts less likely to be true than incompatibilism.I believe that the most important contribution of Swinburne's book concerns his defense of mental causation and free will (as understood by incompatibilists) from the numerous scientific sources of skepticism that have arisen of late. My sense is that the primary reason that philosophers reject dualism, libertarianism, and agent-causation stem from a deep sense that these views, no matter how dressed up in contemporary garb, remain indelibly at odds with a scientific worldview. Swinburne's arguments should give those who harbor this sense serious pause. I am afraid, however, that if one is looking for detailed accounts, especially of libertarianism and agent-causation, one will have to look elsewhere. There is a little development of agent-causal libertarianism and little attention paid to extant criticisms in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Abstract How do infants identify the psychological actors in their environments? Three groups of 12‐month‐old infants were tested for their willingness to encode a simple approach behavior as goal‐directed as a function of whether it was performed by (1) a human hand, (2) a morphologically unfamiliar green object that interacted with a confederate and behaved intentionally, or (3) the same unfamiliar green object that behaved in a matched, but apparently random manner. Using a visual habituation technique, only infants in the first two conditions were found to encode the approach behavior as goal‐directed. Thus infants appear able to attribute goals to non‐human, even unfamiliar agents. These results imply that by the end of the first year of life infants have a broad notion of what counts as an agent that cannot easily be reduced to humans, objects that are perceptually similar to humans, or objects that display self‐propulsion.",

Just as there is no generally agreed on definition of learning, there is no one system of classification. Types of learning commonly recognized are: Habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, operant conditioning, trial and error, taste aversion, latent learning, cultural learning, imprinting, insight learning, learning-set learning and instinct. The term memory must include at least two separate processes. It must involve, on the one hand, that of learning something and on the other, at some later date, recalling that thing. What lies between the learning and (he remembering must be some permanent record — a memory trace — within the brain. Memory exists in at least two forms: memory for very recent events (short-term) which is relatively labile and easily disruptable; and long-term memory, which is much more stable. Not everything that gets into short-term memory becomes fixed in the long-term store; a filtering mechanism selects things that might be important and discards the rest.",

      "title": "Aplikasi patchwork pada busana pesta pria / Dwi Haris Setyawan",
      "abstract": "“Busana merupakan salah satu kebutuhan pokok manusia disamping pangan\r\ndan papan atau perumahan. Pada zaman purba dahulu, tujuan berbusana adalah\r\nuntuk melindungi tubuh dari udara dingin ,panas (sengatan matahari), dan gigitan\r\nserangga serta ada juga yang berhubungan dengan tahayul. Akan tetapi yang\r\nmereka kenakan tersebut belum dapat dikatakan sebagai pakaian, karena banyak\r\nyang bersifat sebagai hiasan belaka, misalnya tubuh dihiasi dengan goresangoresan\r\nyang berwarna (tato), untaian tulang, gigi, kulit kerang “ (Irianti dan Aini.\r\nDalam Irawati 1991:1)\r\nBerdasarkan pendapat diatas, sejak zaman dahulu busana tidak hanya berupa pakaian tetapi\r\njuga berupa hiasan, yang dapat digunakan sebagai pelindung tubuh.\r\nSecara garis besar tujuan berbusana terdiri dari tiga unsur pokok, yaitu untuk memenuhi\r\nkeberadaban dan kesusilaan, memenuhi rasa keindahan, serta memenuhi syarat kesehatan (Irianti\r\ndan Aini dalam Irawati,1991:3). Berdasarkan pendapat tersebut, dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada\r\nawalnya tujuan orang berbusana adalah untuk melindungi tubuh dari berbagai macam gangguan\r\nseperti pengaruh cuaca dan serangan hewan yang kemudian menjadi syarat kesehatan.\r\nPada masa sekarang unsur keindahan tampak lebih menonjol jika dibandingkan dengan\r\nfungsi berbusana lainnya. Keindahan pada busana dapat diciptakan melalui adanya hiasan pada\r\nbusana maupun adanya variasi pada model busana. Keindahan busana juga dapat diciptakan dari\r\nkombinasi warna atau perpaduan warna yang digunakan. Kombinasi warna dapat berpengaruh\r\nterhadap penampilan seseorang dalam berbusana.\r\nSeiring dengan perkembangan zaman yang berpengaruh terhadap aspek kehidupan, ternyata\r\nberpengaruh pula pada dunia fashion. Perkembangan pada dunia fashion dapat dilihat dari\r\nmunculnya model-model busana dengan bermacam-macam hiasan, teknik pengerjaan, sampai\r\npada penggunaan bahan dan warna. Hal tersebut melahirkan karya-karya spektakuler dalam\r\nkhasanah mode busana.\r\nPerkembangan pada dunia fashion dapat ditemui pada semua jenis busana, baik busana pria,\r\nbusana wanita, sampai busana anak yang dapat digunakan untuk berbagai kesempatan.\r\nBusana pesta adalah busana yang dikenakan pada saat pesta serta dapat dikenakan oleh kaum\r\npria dan wanita tanpa mengenal batas usia. Busana pesta memiliki bentuk dan model yang\r\nbermacam – macam baik pemilihan material sampai detail hiasan busana.\r\nBusana pesta untuk pria pada umumnya berupa setelan jas, celana panjang dan pakaian resmi\r\nlain seperti batik. Trend busana pesta pria remaja tahun 2009 mengarah pada busana pesta untuk\r\nsiang hari yang terdiri dari celana pendek, celana yang memiliki panjang sampai dengan tengah\r\nbetis, kemeja pas badan lengan pendek, kemeja tanpa lengan. Pelengkap busana yang dapat\r\ndigunakan seperti scarf, sepatu, ikat pinggang, kacamata. Bahan yang digunakan adalah jenis\r\nkain yang memiliki sifat tidak panas dan bermotif garis-garis.\r\nBusana pesta siang adalah busana pesta yang dikenakan pada waktu siang hari. Adapun ciriciri\r\nbusana pesta siang hari( Waworuntu dalam Irawati 1992:2) adalah : model lebih sederhana\r\ndari busana pesta malam, warna muda dan tidak menyilaukan mata, menggunakan pelengkap\r\nbusana seperti topi, ikat pinggang, sepatu, bahan yang dipakai sejuk dan nyaman bagi\r\npemakainya.\r\nAplikasi berasal dari kata Applique atau Appliquery (bahasa Perancis ) yang berarti\r\nmenempel, melekatkan atau memasang motif pada sebuah busana baik dilakukan dengan mesin\r\njahit ataupun manual dengan tangan (Tjahjadi 2007 :4). Patchwork adalah seni menyatukan\r\npotongan-potongan kain kecil menjadi satu yang kemudian menjadi sebuah motif baru.(Tjahjadi\r\n2007 :4).\r\nAplikasi dengan teknik patchwork berarti menyatukan potongan-potongan kain kecil\r\nmenjadi motif baru yang kemudian ditempelkan pada busana dengan cara dijahit menggunakan\r\nmesin jahit atau dijahit dengan tangan manual.\r\nBusana yang penulis buat adalah busana pesta pria remaja untuk siang hari dengan\r\nmemodifikasi garis/ lajur-lajur menyerupai bentuk geometrik yang merupakan penyesuaian dari\r\ntema “Geometric evolution” dan trend busana pesta pria remaja tahun 2009.\r\nBusana tersebut terdiri dari dua bagian, yaitu busana atas yang merupakan modifikasi dari\r\nrompi/ vest pas badan sebatas pinggang tanpa lengan dan berkrah tegak serta celana yang\r\npanjangnya sampai dengan dibawah lutut.\r\n“Rompi atau yang lebih dikenal dengan nama vest adalah salah satu jenis\r\npakaian yang hadir pertama kali pada masa Baroque dan RococoPada awalnya vest\r\ndibuat dengan panjang hingga lutut, akan tetapi seiring dengan adanya\r\nperkembangan telah dipendekkan hingga batas pinggang. Vest biasanya dibuat\r\ntanpa lengan (sleeveless), memiliki bermacam-macam krah seperti rebah, rever,\r\nsetali, sampai krah tegak. Vest dapat dibuat telangkup tunggal (Single Breasted),\r\ntelangkup dobel (Double Breasted),menggunakan kancing ataupun menggunakan\r\npenutup tarik (zipper)”(Poespo ,2005 :1)\r\nCelana (Trousers)adalah pakaian luar yang menutupi badan atau lebih khususnya kaki dari\r\npinggang sampai ke mata kaki .\r\nDetail dari busana pesta pria menggunakan aplikasi patchwork yang memodifikasi\r\ngaris/lajur-lajur menjadi bentuk geometrik yang menyerupai bentuk segitiga dan segi empat.\r\nBentuk-bentuk geometrik tersebut dibuat dengan dua warna yang berbeda pada tiap\r\nlajurnya. Ukuran dari tiap lajur juga dibuat berbeda antara satu dengan yang lain. Perbedaan\r\nukuran tersebut digunakan untuk mengurangi kesan monoton, menambah kesan dinamis pada\r\npengulangan bentuk geometrik.\r\nAlasan lain pemilihan bentuk geometrik yang menyerupai bentuk segitiga dan segi empat\r\nadalah karena penulis ingin menuangkan inspirasi yang berasal dari bentuk-bentuk geometrik\r\ntersebut ke dalam busana pesta pria remaja yang diwujudkan dalam aplikasi patchwork.\r\nBusana pesta dengan hiasan aplikasi patchwork dapat dilengkapi dengan sepatu boot\r\nsetinggi tengah betis serta topi tanpa tutup pada bagian atas.\r\nBahan yang digunakan untuk busana pesta pria dengan hiasan aplikasi patchwork adalah\r\nkain rayon atau katun sutra. Rayon adalah kain dengan benang halus yang panjangnya dapat\r\ndibuat seberapa panjangnya dan merupakan serat buatan yang ditemukan pada tahun 1884.\r\nSeiring dengan perkembangannya kemudian rayon dikenal masyarakat dengan nama dagang\r\nkatun sutera.\r\nRoesbani (1982 :30) menyebutkan rayon atau yang lebih dikenal dengan nama katun sutera\r\nmemiliki sifat meliputi:\r\n· Sifatnya hampir mirip dengan sutra\r\n· Dalam keadaan basah kekuatannya dapat hilang sampai dengan 50 %\r\n· Untuk mencuci dapat menggunakan sabun dengan kadar Ph rendah\r\n· Tidak boleh disikat pada saat dicuci\r\n· Boleh diperas tetapi tidak dengan cara dipulir\r\n· Pada saat dijemur setelah dicuci tidak boleh dibawah terik sinar mata\r\nhari langsung\r\n· Berkilau khas, akan tetapi dengan penyempurnaan dapat mengurangi\r\nKilaunya\r\n· Mudah menghisap air, permukaannya licin serta sejuk apabila dipakai\r\nBerdasarkan uraian diatas, penulis memilih rayon / katun sutera dikarenakan kain tersebut\r\nsesuai dengan waktu pesta yakni siang hari yang menuntut kenyamanan bagi pemakai.\r\nWarna bahan / kain yang digunakan pada busana pesta pria remaja dengan hiasan aplikasi\r\npatchwork adalah hijau dan kuning yang jika dipadukan akan menghasilkan warna analogus.\r\nWarna dapat mengungkapkan suasana perasaan, sifat dan watak yang berbeda-beda. Warna hijau\r\nmempunyai sifat keseimbangan dan keselarasan, membangkitkan ketenangan. Warna kuning\r\nmenggambarkan sesuatu yang bersinar atau bersifat cahaya, serta mengesankan sesuatu.\r\nBerdasarkan uraian yang telah disebutkan sebelumnya, penulis memilih aplikasi yang\r\nditerapkan dalam teknik patchwork dikarenakan penulis berharap teknik tersebut dapat dijadikan\r\nsebagai referensi baru dalam pembuatan busana pesta pria lebih khususnya dalam menghias\r\nbusana pesta pria..\r\nKesan tegas diberikan oleh penulis pada aplikasi patchwork vest dengan cara menambahkan\r\nhiasan berupa kancing kait (hook and eye). Kancing kait yang dipergunakan adalah kancing kait\r\nyang biasa dipasang sebagai hak pada ban pinggang celana atau rok , akan tetapi kancing kait\r\nyang yang dipakai tidaklah semuanya dalam artian tidak dengan pasangannya tetapi hanya yang\r\nberbentuk lempengan panjang dan yang biasa dikait.\r\nPemakaian kancing kait dimaksudkan untuk lebih memperkuat karakter dari bentuk\r\ngeometrik aplikasi patchwork pada busana atas selain untuk menyeimbangkan motif aplikasi\r\nyang ada pada vest dengan yang ada pada bagian celana. Keluar dari hal tersebut penulis\r\nberusaha mencoba mengenalkan teknik menghias busana pesta pria dengan kancing kait tanpa\r\nmengurangi nilai kemaskulinan sang pemakai busana.",

      "title": "Balance and Falls among Older People",
      "abstract": "An increasing body of clinical and basic research acknowledges the functional decline of sensory and integrative systems in older adults and associates impairments in these systems with an increase in falls. The risk of falls underscores the importance of the of the older adult to be able to receive and integrate sensory information and to take appropriate action to avoid falling. BALANCE, THE SIXTH SENSE What does a complaint of feeling off-balance mean? The complaint could refer to an unwanted interaction of prescribed or over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies, an underlying cardiovascular problem, or age-related or disease-related declines in the balance system. Balance instability is a marker of fall risk and frailty. Balance is the ability of the person to remain in equilibrium and to orient to gravity, the support surface, and to objects in the environment when performing routine activities of daily living (Newton, 2002). Balance could also be described as the to maintain one's lifestyle without falling. Balance is needed when standing or sitting still and when moving in the environment. Anticipatory balance responses precede movements such as raising the arm up to comb one's hair, reaching for an object on a high shelf, or putting dishes in the dishwasher. Older adults with balance dysfunction due to age-related declines or other problems might hold on to the sink in order to perform these routine tasks. Holding on to an object or a person to avoid falling may be a good strategy, providing the object or person is stable. Compensatory balance responses occur in reaction to an external event such as being pushed or tripping over an obstacle. Compensatory balance responses are automatic, occur within 90 milliseconds, and help the individual maintain or regain balance following the perturbing event. The three most important sensory systems responsible for good balance are the visual system, the vestibular system (involving the inner ear), and the somatosensory system (a complex collection of sensors that transmit information about the state of the body and its immediate environment). For example, the somatosensory receptors located in the legs and feet provide information about the condition of the support surface-slippery floor, high pile rug. Receptors (called proprioceptors because they respond to stimuli within an organism) located in the neck and trunk provide information about the alignment of the back and head. Vision provides information about the location and dimension of objects in the environment and the condition of the support surface and lighting. The vestibular receptors in the inner ear provide information about the position of the person in space-moving, turning, and tilting. Many age-related changes that affect balance occur gradually, permitting older adults to compensate until they reach a critical point that results in balance instability. These age-related changes include a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensory receptors that monitor information, a slowing of the nervous system capabilities, and muscle weakness due to inactivity. Gradual declines in these systems also occur with disease. For example, peripheral diabetic neuropathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of falls. Older adults tend to place greater reliance on the visual system to compensate for age or disease-related reductions in the vestibular or somatosensory system, even when visual information is misleading. Relying on one sensory system is problematic; adults over the age of 65 with visual impairments are at least three times more likely than unimpaired adults to have difficulty with mobility, for example in walking, going outside, and performing routine daily activities (Maino, 1996). Wearing bifocal or trifocal or progressive lenses affects the capability to detect environmental hazards by impairing contrast sensitivity and depth perception. …",

      "abstract": "A ritual act which aims at establishment or exoneration of imputed guilt is the ordeal, ‘satyakriyā’, the act of truth. It is an indirect appeal to fate or the invisible agencies which act and control human destiny. When falsely accused, a person sometimes appealed to the elements in nature and to supernatural powers to bear witness to his or her innocence. “Forms of ordeal and the whole theory of the oath as well as its practice up to the latest stages of civilization depend on the principle of the conditional curse often embodied in symbolic action. An oath may be regarded as essentially a conditional self-imprecation, a curse by which a person calls down upon himself some evil in the event of what he says being untrue. All the resources of symbolic magic are drawn upon in the multitudinous examples of this principle… The oath carries with it the punishment for perjury. In ancient states all laws were accompanied by a curse upon the transgressor… Law gradually takes over the function of the curse, as a form of retribution.” In India the ordeal is first met with in the Ṛgveda where a person calls death upon himself if he is a monster as his enemy apparently accuses him of being. Now he calls upon the supernatural agencies which are in charge of life and death to prove his innocence (i.e. he is a man and not a monster) and if he truly is a monster as the accuser says, may death be visited on him that same day. How does he expect this to happen? He has an innate faith in some sort of cosmic justice operative in the world, in a fate whose visitations are morally balanced. Hence this oath.",

      "abstract": "In the human brain, simple molecules and complex circuits are constantly making decisions which are indispensable for our survival and also to accomplish a variety of daily activities such as walking, memorizing, conversing, composing music, painting or poetry.... All are the result of the integration of many neural systems that perceive many and simultaneous visual, tactile, auditory and/or mental stimuli. Once synthetized, they are immediately transmitted to the corresponding executive systems, thus completing the fascinating functional loop of decision-making: a) perception of stimuli or information which originate in the environment, b) selection and elaboration of the decision which is considered more appropriate or attractive according to personal experience or intuition and c) execution. If these neural nets have been damaged or haven failed to develop the mechanisms of facilitation or inhibition that govern them become unbalanced. If inhibition is reduced, excessive and violent behaviour is expressed as in patients suffering from manic phases. Conversely, if inhibition is excessive, decision making mechanisms are not operative. In either case, behaviour is not \"reasonable\" and does not follow prototypical patterns. All these processes must be the consequence of a constant molecular activity full of micro-decisions whose effectiveness depends on the histological and biochemical integrity of the neurons. This microenvironment is responsible for all types of decisions of all forms of life and represents one of the fundamental successes of evolution.",

      "abstract": "This chapter describes the loose relationship between sex scenes in games and a three-act narrative structure, and how sex's place on the latter affects its impact on the player and the story. It breaks down the concept of rising and falling action or tension and describes the implications of sex in each phase of the story: Act 1 establishing setup, setting up the world and characters sex here establishes the character's relationships or personality before the story begins. Act 1 inciting incident, an event that kicks the action of the game into motion sex can be an inciting incident! Act 2 rising action, as the stakes and tension of the game grow higher sex becomes part of story and character development along the way. Act 2 before the climax, or Act 3 climax sex as a dramatic \"deep breath\" before the final plunge, or the final step of a developing relationship arc. Act 3 resolution sex as part of the \"happily ever after.\" Outside the three-act structure some games and/or sex scenes aren't attached to a central narrative and may take place separately (e.g., open-world encounters). The chapter also stresses that if there is only one sex scene in a game, its place in the larger narrative structure takes on bigger story importance as The Big Sex Scene, while having multiple sex scenes can spread this out and ameliorate the effect. The chapter ends with questions on applying this structure to existing games or the reader's projects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Imposing a norm-based, expectational discipline on one another, the humanoids will be motivated by the fear of anyone’s defection to manifest their expectations to that individual, exhorting them to conform. They will say, ‘You should and can conform’, ascribing but also reinforcing that capacity. Let the person fail, however, and in the absence of a (full) excuse—a failure of rationality, knowledge, or voluntariness—they will reaffirm ex post the ability ascribed ex ante in exhortation: ‘You should and could have conformed’. And viewing the breach of the norm in that way—as one that occurred in the presence of a capacity to conform—they will intuitively blame or censure the offender. They will be positioned to do this, moreover, by identifying with the ex-ante exhortation of someone else or even with the self-exhortation of the agent. Perhaps that agent’s active self-exhortation—‘I can conform’—or perhaps a standby variant: this will materialize when the individual manifestly commits to the norm and is positioned so that any temptation to defect will raise a red flag, alerting them exhortatively to its appeal. In the emerging sense of blame, they will be able to interiorize the exercise and blame themselves as well. To the extent that someone is self-exhortatively effective in holding themselves to shared norms and values—or more personal counterparts—they will be possessed of free will in an intuitively recognizable sense: in a sense in which it is constituted by willpower.",

Although all of these rules, “Do not kill,” “Do not cause pain,” “Do not disable,” “Do not deprive of freedom,” and “Do not deprive of pleasure,” are justified general moral rules, they are not the only rules toward which all impartial rational persons would take the moral attitude. In fact, these rules include only two of the original seven explicit moral rules listed in chapter 5. Three of the general moral rules justified in the previous chapter, “Do not disable,” “Do not deprive of freedom,” and “Do not deprive of pleasure,” were not even listed as explicit moral rules. However, this is not in any way disturbing, for disabling a person or depriving him of freedom or of pleasure is considered by all to be immoral unless justified. These rules were always implicit moral rules. Further, these three rules share all the other relevant characteristics of “Do not kill” and “Do not cause pain,” except having been listed as explicit moral rules.",

      "title": "Dehumanization and mental health",
      "abstract": "Dehumanization is a fearsome word, calling to mind the gravest atrocities of the past and present. People seen as less than human have suffered and suffer violence, deprivation, exclusion and dispossession, and that suffering has been and is routinely ignored or minimized. However, although dehumanization is usually understood as an extreme phenomenon confined to wars, genocides and conquests, it falls on a spectrum. Two decades of social psychological research have shown that it has significant repercussions in everyday life1. The burgeoning literature on dehumanization offers three key insights. First, dehumanization ranges from blatant and verbalized to subtle and unconscious: people can be explicitly likened to animals, but also implicitly denied fundamental human qualities such as rationality, self-control and complex emotions. Second, dehumanization takes varied forms, from seeing others as bestial or robotic, to rejecting their individuality or agency, to failing to spontaneously grant them minds. Third, although dehumanization often accompanies negative views of others, it is psychologically and even neurally distinct from prejudice. Seeing people as less than fully human is not the same as disliking them. We can dehumanize those about whom we are indifferent, not only those we hate. Indeed, studies of close relationships show that we can subtly dehumanize those we love. The vast literature on stigma reveals how people with mental illness are often viewed negatively by the general public, pictured as dangerous, blameworthy and shameful, with adverse implications for equity, well-being and recovery. It has recently become clear that, in addition to these negative perceptions, they are often also denied humanity. People are seen as less human when they receive mental rather than physical illness labels, and people with mental illnesses – especially schizophrenia and addictions – are even more blatantly dehumanized than some vilified ethnic or religious minorities2. Dehumanizing attitudes to the mentally ill are not confined to the public, but can also be held by mental health professionals. Researchers have begun to document the causes and consequences of these attitudes. One contributing factor is emotional self-preservation: professionals may dehumanize patients as a way to protect themselves against emotional exhaustion and distress3. The anticipation of emotional demands may motivate professionals to deny humanity to others and result in the withholding of empathy and care. Studies like these shine a new light on burnout, one of whose primary manifestations is the loss of empathy for others. In clinical settings, this dehumanization-like tendency may lead professionals to disengage from patients, failing to appreciate their emotional experience and reducing them to their diagnosis. Adverse working conditions that foster burnout, such as excessive workloads and organizations that treat employees as interchangeable cogs in an industrial machine, can lead mental health professionals to dehumanize patients, with the adverse effects on clinical care that burnout researchers have documented. One study found that psychiatric nurses who felt unsupported by their organizational superiors were more likely to experience burnout and depression as well as to dehumanize their patients (e.g., showing a greater willingness to bypass their consent)4. People who seek mental health treatment need not be denied humanity on the basis of their illness to suffer the impacts of dehumanization. Dehumanizing perceptions of racial minorities might contribute to racial disparities in mental health diagnosis and treatment, such as significantly elevated rates of chemical sedation in African American patients presenting to emergency departments with psychiatric disorders5, just as race-based dehumanization contributes to harsh discipline in criminal justice and educational settings. People who believe they are being denied humanity by others typically respond negatively. Just as believing that one is dehumanized based on one's race or political views has been shown to generate antagonistic reactions, so patients' engagement with psychiatric treatment may be undermined by experiences of dehumanization from demeaning media representations, dismissive interactions with professionals, and deindividuating encounters with the health care bureaucracy6. Dehumanizing perceptions can also be internalized rather than resisted. People who believe that others see them as less than human may come to \"self-dehumanize\". This phenomenon may have significant clinical implications. A study of patients with severe alcohol use disorders found that those who self-dehumanized more had lower self-esteem and engaged in less functional coping7. Research such as this indicates how dehumanization can create vicious cycles that compromise therapeutic aims. Being dehumanized can lead to feeling dehumanized, which can sabotage treatment. Being perceived as less than human may exacerbate an existing mental illness, but dehumanization might also be a risk factor for developing it. Indeed, studies point to adverse effects of dehumanization which are known psychiatric vulnerability factors. Being perceived as less than human increases people's feelings of social exclusion and also decreases others' willingness to help and show empathy1. The resulting social disconnection may amplify risk especially for internalizing and substance use disorders. In addition to reducing social connection, dehumanization increases tendencies to actively harm people and to tolerate harm perpetrated by others. People with stronger tendencies to dehumanize others are more likely to engage in bullying; men who dehumanize women are more prone to sexual violence and harassment; and people who dehumanize their opponents in ethnic conflicts are more likely to support violent actions towards them1. Exposure to violence is a significant psychiatric risk factor, and dehumanization fosters it. At a more systemic level, dehumanization based on race, social class, and immigrant status may reinforce the public acceptance of social disadvantage and economic hardship, known contributors to mental health inequities. The concept of dehumanization has proven to be a fruitful one for thinking about many forms of interpersonal and intergroup conflict. It complements more familiar constructs such as prejudice, stigma, stereotyping and discrimination by focusing on whether we perceive and treat others in ways that recognize our common humanity. Failures to do so have now been demonstrated in perceptions of diverse social groups, and their destructive implications are increasingly well understood. Research on dehumanization in the psychiatric realm is in its infancy, but strongly suggests that failures to fully humanize people with mental illness are widespread and have significant consequences. How dehumanization related to mental illness should be addressed is not a straightforward issue. At a population level, a cultural change is required for public perceptions of mental illness to become more humanizing. The promotion of dimensional models may lead people with mental illness to be seen as less drastically \"other\". Some aspects of dehumanizing media representations of mental illness have measurably declined in recent decades8. It is equally important to lessen dehumanization in clinical practice9. Dehumanization can be reduced by enhancing empathy in professionals, through selection and training, while recognizing that empathy and problem-solving can sometimes be in conflict, and by promoting face-to-face contact between professionals and patients despite the growing intrusion of medical technologies. Dehumanization can also be diminished by ensuring that patients and professionals are presented as individuals with uniquely identifying attributes, boosting patients' sense of agency by increasing their say over treatment, and attenuating the real and perceived dissimilarity between patients and professionals. The goal of humanizing care, within and beyond the mental health field, should be widely recognized and shared, and concrete strategies to address this goal should be identified and implemented. In addition to this, the impact of dehumanization on mental health at the population level should become a more explicit and specific focus of research.",

The final category involves physical characteristics that compromise bodily appearance or functioning. Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance. Like the other types of stigma, undesirable physical characteristics isolate some individuals, disqualifying them from full social acceptance. Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the nonstigmatized is often awkward and uncertain. Tension is manifest in people's tendency to avoid eye contact, make guarded references to the stigma, or avoid everyday words that suddenly become taboo; it leads both parties to consider avoiding or withdrawing from encounters.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing disposition in some quarters to look on every criminal as an unsound person having a special neurosis; to discover, diagnostic evidence of the criminal nature in the conformation of the head and face, and in defective structure of brain; and to demand in consequence that criminals should not be punished as responsible, but treated as diseased, beings. It is a tendency against which, in the interests of true psychology, a timely protest may well be made; for its interests cannot in the end be served by pretensions to a knowledge which it is far from possessing and by unwarrantable claims to authority based upon such pretensions. If all criminals are, as the theory postulates, of defective or diseased mental organization, we must needs go on to acknowledge that few, if any, persons are well formed or sound mentally. Every Christian who listens reverently to the reading of the Ten Commandments and prays devoutly that God will incline his heart to keep them, feels, or ought to feel if he be in earnest, that he has in him the potentiality of committing every crime or sin forbidden by them. That he does not commit a particular crime which another person does is not owing always to a stronger and better nature in him, nor to an opportune infusion of prevenient grace, but to the absence of the adequate temptation in the circumstances of his life and calling. Time and the occasion count for much in the production of crime, as in the production of other human events; and it is quite possible that behind the crime of one who succumbs to an overwhelming temptation there may sometimes lie more merit than in the open virtue of another who has never been greatly tempted.",

It is not a good that betters the lives of individual human persons (for they would not exist otherwise), but it is the individual human persons themselves. In order to aim successfully at the creation of particular individuals, however, God would need a control of history so complete that it might be argued to be inconsistent with beliefs about human free will that are important to some theologies. In order to avoid this problem, a second version of Non-Identity Theodicy is constructed. This version considers whether God’s justifying motivation could be a desire for beings of our type, even if it could not be a desire for particular individuals. It is suggested that God would be interested in loving those he creates under various descriptions (e.g., biological, psychological, and narrative descriptions) and that a horror-prone environment is necessary for us to be the type of being we are under these descriptions. This second version of Non-Identity Theodicy allows some version of Non-Identity Theodicy to be available to the theist regardless of her views about the existence and nature of human free will.",

      "abstract": "The essentials of an education are: (1) a knowledge of actual life; (2) a definite impelling interest in some phase of life; (3) the recognition from actual experience of one's own capacity and limitations of adjustment; (4) the acquirement of the emotional attitudes and habits necessary for perceiving and adapting to reality. These ensure against nervous breakdown, but are not synonymous with modern education, which views the problems of man as he was or may become, not his reactions as he is. Life is a process of slow adjustment, and must be accepted as it is. If elemental biological facts are not faced squarely serious personal difficulty arises. Conflict to the point of mental depression can be so met as to preserve sound personal judgment on public questions. Individual conscious processes are not so essential to adjustment as is believed: decision is made from well grounded feeling, often not from reason which can be logically detailed. An outstanding example is Abraham Lincoln, whom science cannot explain by his heredity or early experiences. Successful life implies consciousness of the reality of environment, and avoids the visions of intemperate idealism. The student is not taught to know himself, to estimate the present, and to intelligently adjust to immediate circumstances.

Likewise, if I have medicine, and someone else who is sick does not, I am obligated to share my medicine. Unfortunately, with regard to medicines and other essential products, modern institutions of intellectual property often fail to enforce or even recognize such ethical obligations. In some ways, these institutions uphold an even harsher attitude toward intellectual property than other types of property. With food, even if the hungry person receives no bread, he is still permitted to produce his own. With medicines, medical technologies, and other types of goods that are protected by institutions of intellectual property, the law can and often does prevent the sick person from producing her own.",

      "abstract": "Famine belongs to one of several divine punishments which are referred to again and again in the Hebrew Bible and throughout the Ancient Near East. Oracles and curses mention famine as a future-conditional event. This paper focuses on a subgroup of texts announcing not only famine and aggregate food-supply shortfalls but expressing the abolition of the regular order and the connection between deed and punishment (e. g., people will plant but never enjoy the fruits, they will eat but never have enough, etc.). While in the so called indictment/judgment oracles (e. g. Hos 4:10–11; Am 4:6–8; 5,10–11; Mic 6:9–16; Zeph 1:12–13) the offence has already be done, in the so called “treaty curses” the punishment will only be fulfilled in case of violation of the inscription (Statue from Tell Feḫerīye; Bukān Stela), the treaty (Sfīre Stela) or the covenant (Lev 26:14–39; Deut 28:15–44). In either case the emotion of fear plays an important part. These dystopian texts (“futility curses”) convey a warning predicting a bleak future and in some cases the expectation of the future even surpasses what has been experienced in the past by stressing the futility of action.",

The physical order in a man is the right disposition of parts and mixture of elements, which *if* a little discomposed he is troubled, if much, he certainly dies. The rational order of man is when the superior part has dominion over the inferior, the mind governs the body, the understanding rules the will and passions. Small transgressions of this order, deviations from reason, we call folly or error, but extreme habitual *transgressions* deserve the name of madness. Nature teaches us that he who is the head of a family is to be obeyed, else the order is broken and the family dissolved. The disobedient son in Moses' law was therefore to be stoned. A family is the union of several men into one body to live together. The two greater assemblies are in armies to make war, or in civil societies to preserve peace. Exact order is required in both: subjection and obedience in the inferior to the superior. This is so punctually observed in military discipline that the least prevarication is death, and no merit can preserve the offender. Manlius Torquatus put his son to death, having contrary to order fought with a valiant Latin that challenged him and slain him.",

Therefore, as a Christian it is very important to research to find views based on the truth of God's word regarding the act of suicide. Suicide is a conscious and deliberate act of self-killing. Therefore the act of suicide is a denial of God's sovereignty. The sin of suicide becomes different from other sins that humans may still be able to commit. Because the act of suicide has deliberately eliminated the space (opportunity) for confession (repentance), so that the act of suicide is a sign that the perpetrator is not an heir in the kingdom of God. The body is the temple of God, the place where God lives, which means that all the believers' actions must manifest the attributes of God in the midst of this world. God is the giver of life and He is also its owner. Therefore, the body should not be put to death by anyone except by the will of Allah. Thus, if someone has committed suicide, he has denied the essence of God's sovereignty as the giver and owner of life. People who commit suicide are refusing to live.&#x0D; Abstraksi: Sebuah fakta bahwa peristiwa bunuh diri masih terjadi hingga masa sekarang ini. Oleh karena itu sebagai seorang Kristen sangat penting meneliti untuk menemukan pandangan berdasarkan kebenaran firman Tuhan berkenaan dengan tindakan bunuh diri tersebut. Tindakan bunuh diri adalah merupakan tindakan sadar dan sengaja mematikan diri. Oleh karena itu tindakan bunuh diri merupakan penyangkalan akan kedaulatan Allah. Dosa bunuh diri menjadi berbeda dari dosa-dosa yang lain yang mungkin masih dapat dilakukan oleh manusia. Sebab tindakan bunuh diri telah sengaja menghilangkan ruang (kesempatan) pengakuan dosa (pertobatan), sehingga tindakan bunuh diri merupakan tanda bahwa sesungguhnya pelakunya bukanlah pewaris dalam kerajaan Allah. Tubuh adalah Bait Allah, tempat Allah bersemayam yang berarti bahwa segala laku orang percaya harus memanifestasikan sifat-sifat Allah di tengah-tengah dunia ini. Allah adalah pemberi hidup dan Dia jugalah sebagai pemiliknya. Oleh karena itu tubuh tidak boleh dimatikan oleh siapapun kecuali oleh kehendak Allah. Dengan demikian, jikalau seseorang telah melakukan tindakan bunuh diri maka dia telah menyangkali hakikat kedaulatan Allah sebagai pemberi dan pemilik hidup.

Or is thinking the body special a kind of sentimentalism that blocks clear thinking about matters such as prostitution, surrogate motherhood, and the sale of spare kidneys? I argue that the language we use does matter, and that thinking of the body as property encourages a self/body dualism that obscures the power relations involved in all contracts that cedes authority over the body. Recognising the self as embodied, however, also makes it harder to insist on sharp distinctions between activities that involve the body and those that “just” involve the mind, hence harder to justify refusing payment for explicitly body services while condoning it for those to which the body is more incidental. I therefore provide a modest defence of monetary compensation for those who “donate” bodily products or services. Compensation does not, however, mean markets for there is at least one sense in which the body is special. This is that more so, and more intrinsically than other markets, markets in body parts or bodily services depend on inequality. I use this to make a case against such markets.",

Así mismo, el ser humano manifiesta caracteres fenotípicos y genotípicos únicos como, por ejemplo, los rasgos faciales que, además de diferenciarnos de otras especies animales, nos distinguen de otros seres humanos; los cuales a su vez manifiestan características variables. Es por eso que la diferenciación y especificación son dos aspectos muy importantes para encasillar dichas características a un individuo. Las Ciencias Forenses es una rama de la investigación que permite esclarecer hechos que se han cometido en distintas circunstancias, es por ello que busca descubrir el hecho delictivo a través de pruebas periciales que serán de gran ayuda en los procesos judiciales. Alrededor del mundo, a menudo, el técnico forense puede encontrarse con indicios en la escena del crimen que liguen o asocien al victimario con el delito cometido o atentado contra la integridad de otro individuo, estos pueden ser, elementos que se encuentran en la escena del delito, en la víctima y/o en el victimario; aplicando así el principio de intercambio el cual manifiesta que todo paso por el lugar de los hechos deja tras de sí una huella aprovechable. Entre estos indicios se encuentran: máculas sanguíneas, fibras textiles, elementos pilosos o capilares, entre otros. Estos indicios mediante el análisis de laboratorio permiten vincular sus características a las del victimario y su papel en el desarrollo del delito. Es por ello que el laboratorio forense realiza diversas pruebas tanto de microscopía (observación y pruebas especiales) como microscopía (características fenotípicas). Entre esas técnicas se encuentra la tricología forense la misma que resulta nueva y muy poco usada, la cual responde al estudio del elemento piloso que contribuye en muchas maneras a la resolución de numerosos casos que pueden estar llevándose a cabo mediante la comparación de elementos dubitados e indubitados que permitan dar un estudio comparativo de la investigación, por ello al examinar detalles como la forma, dirección, color, residuos genéticos entre otros aspectos secundarios del elemento piloso encontrado en la escena del crimen, se puede hacer una comparación con una muestra del sospechoso y puede atribuir o descartar su relación o implicancia TRICOLOGÍA FORENSE - Incluye ilustraciones y descripciones 20 en algún acto delictivo, permitiendo así la autenticidad e integridad del indicio , como pieza clave desde la recolección en la escena del hecho hasta la presentación en juicio, permitiendo así garantizar su calidad probatoria, debido a que se encuentra enmarcado en instrumentos internacionales. En la problemática mencionada, debemos entender que las Ciencias Forenses son una rama con un crecimiento evolutivo acelerado, pues son áreas que no se han manejado rutinariamente. Al contrario, se están utilizando y estandarizando técnicas, protocolos, y material que permita ejercer un estudio correcto de cada una de las áreas ya sea la biología forense, la química forense, la histopatología forense, entre otras. En definitiva, resulta un mundo nuevo, en el que muy pocos han profundizado, además de contribuir con el público forense como una herramienta útil para su aplicación en el área del conocimiento mencionada; es por eso que, se ha creado un manuscrito con información de Ecuador que aporte al estudio tricológico forense con patrones propios del área geográfica, siendo un referente dentro de las investigaciones y un aporte a las ciencias investigativas forenses.",

      "title": "Words as Things",
      "abstract": "IS A WORD A THING? It depends, of course, on what is meant by thing. If sensible properties constitute thingness, then word is certainly thing. It exists either as sound to be heard or mark to be seen. There is long tradition, however, of denying words the status of things. In the short essay that follows, I will suggest that this tradition begins when words are required to represent things or matter. If words are to give clear representation of things (empirical or notional), they must forego their own thingness. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Bacon draws strong line between words and things. To emphasize the inferiority of words to things, he compares words to three forms of representation:(1) flourish on the initial letter of patent or limned book; the statue Pygmalion fell in love with; painting like Zeuxis's famous still life of grapes that looked real blackbird tried to peck them.(2) This mistaking of the unreal for the real is what Bacon terms Pygmalion's frenzy, madness like idolatry that fixates on the image rather than the thing the image represents. In all three instances, the forbidden graven image is imagined as being itself immaterial. It offers up nothing of its own to read, to embrace, to eat. But, of course, all these forms of representation do have substance of their own, though it is not the same as that of the thing they represent. The flourish is made of ink on paper, the statue of stone, the painting of canvas and pigment. If these images were granted materiality, they would themselves become things worthy of the desire (to study, love, eat) that is the due of what they represent. Their pursuit then would be impelled not by mad frenzy but by perfectly reasonable interest. If words are to serve as transparent representations of things, their own thinglike or sensible properties must be overlooked. Or else remade in the image of what they represent. Thus Bacon hinted at an alternative system of notation that would work without the help or intervention of words.(3) Its characters, he speculated, would resemble the things they represented, either physically as pictographs or conceptually as ideographs. In the second half of the century, Bacon's suggestion materialized in the project sponsored by the Royal Society to devise an artificial language. John Wilkins, for example, in his 800-page An Essay Toward Real Character, and Philosophical Language (1668) describes set of characters intended to represent directly the objects or notions common to all men.(4) Each character stands for thing or an idea, and when properly distributed and combined they are to correspond with empirical observation or philosophical ordering. In these attempts, characters are designed in the likeness of the things they represent; their own material attributes are forged to match what they stand for. Words, it might be said, have been phased into things. Indeed it is not much of leap to Swift's satire of the Royal Society's linguistic projects. Gulliver stumbles upon an academy whose members have abolished words altogether and communicate solely by brandishing things. If long conversation is anticipated, huge bundles are assembled; for shorter ones, few items under the arm will do.(5) The Royal Society was also concerned with improving the use of ordinary language. In his History of the Royal Society (1667), Thomas Sprat commends the Society's commitment to aligning words with things; he reproduces several of its reports, which are exemplary in their description of so many things almost in an equal number of words.(6) John Wilkins's first consideration is to assign marks or names to all things and notions in order to attain a just Enumeration. Ordinary language is riddled with two defects that upset this ideal balance: homonyms and synonyms. Either there are not enough words to match things or else too many. In the case of homonyms, one word is used for many things: bill, for example, is used to mean weapon, bird's beak, and written scroll. …",

Concept of time as a form of wealth leads one to take first step in classying wealth. Wealth can be broadly classified into: 1) Current Wants (consisting of goods and services that an economic entity wants to possess) 2) Current means (Consists of money and money related forms of wealth) 3) Future wants and 4)Future means. When wants are more and means are few, current wants may be changed to future wants or cheaper wants may substitute costlier wants or furure means(loans and credit) may be cashed or converted into current means. Wants and means can neither be created nor be destroyed but can be changed from one form to another.",

When Valentinus claimed that Jesus did not excrete waste, he assumed that the regular process of human digestion included a stage in which food was putrefied in the gut. For Valentinus (and later Epiphanius of Salamis), it was unholy—and thus wrong—for Jesus to contain putrefaction (i.e., corruption). Instead, “Jesus produced divinity.” This means that Jesus produced his own immortal body (including intestines). Valentinus’s comment did not undermine Jesus’s humanity; it creatively worked out what divine humanity meant in a physiological sense. According to Valentinus, Jesus’s body was both the same as and different from (fallen) human bodies. Jesus had all the digestive organs that present humans have, but they did not work in the same way because Jesus’s self-control had changed the nature of his body, immortalizing and deifying it.",

      "abstract": "The article comprises an attempt to answer the question why some material objects are, in a social and cultural sense, more long-lasting than others. The answer lies in the model of the life-space of the things. This space is created by two basic dimensions. The first is defined by the character of the relationships created by the objects (this dimension comprises the opposition between the technical relations versus the communicative ones). The second is defined by the character of the relationship between the body of the user and the material object (this is created by the opposition: accessible or inaccessible to sensory experience). The transition of the material object through this space is the life-way of the object, and it is precisely this which defines the longevity of the object and thus the length of time it persists within a specific community. The author determines that long-lasting objects are above all those which are linked with the community, or users, by single, unambiguous relationships and links, while those which have ambivalent and multiple links are of shorter lifespan. Whether or not a thing has a long life or not is determined therefore by the multiplicity of meanings it has which render impossible its role as a stabiliser of the links that constitute a community, as a foundation of the individual’s identity, a guarantee of ontological security.",

      "title": "Erasmus and Luther",
      "abstract": "Abstract For Erasmus, the relationship between God and the human being is rationally and morally acceptable fair play in which both parties have their responsibilities. He follows the teaching of Nominalism: God has promised to grant his grace to anyone who does the minimum that he/she naturally can for receiving grace. “Free choice” means that the human being has the capability of applying him/herself to the things which lead to eternal salvation or turning away from them.Impenitence is a sin that can never be forgiven; moral deeds “attract” grace. For Luther, freedom in moral decisions plays a crucial role in the human community “in front of the world and people,” in relation to the “things below oneself.” But the human being is not free in his/her relation to the “things above oneself,” “in front of God,” or facing the power of unfaith, sin, and demonic evil. Should there be any change in the human’s relation to the realities “above oneself,” it is always a work of God’s prevenient grace effected by the Holy Spirit. Faith is a “new creation” infused into human hearts by God’s Spirit; sola fide is fully a Pneumatological reality for Luther—a fact overlooked in Luther research. The Spirit establishes an intimate union between the Triune God and the human being. Luther creates a massive defense of God’s sovereign grace, sola gratia. The doctrine of two “kingdoms” is the backbone of Luther’s thinking. Erasmus did not make such a distinction; consequently, law and gospel get mixed.",

      "title": "In Defense of an Animal’s Right to Life",
      "abstract": "Dr. R.G. Frey, Advisor In this dissertation, my primary aim is to defend the idea that animals have a basic moral right to life, such that we have a strong duty to refrain from killing them. More specifically, I argue that animals’ right to life is equal in strength to humans’ right to life, such that our duty not to kill animals is just as strong as our duty not to kill humans. An implication of this right is that we are required to cease killing animals for food, material, and purposes of scientific experimentation. I approach my thesis by examining two main objections to the view that animals have an equal right to life. The first objection contends that animals do not have a right to life because they do not have an interest to live. According to this objection, animals have no interest to live either (1) because having interests requires having desires and animals cannot have desires, or (2) because even if animals can have desires and interests, they do not have specifically an interest to live. In response, I argue, first, that many animals are in fact capable of having desires. Second, I argue that many animals do have specifically an interest to live. The second objection contends that animals do not have an equal right to life because life has less value for animals than humans. According to this objection, life has greater value for humans than animals because human life is richer than animal life, and this is the case because only humans possess traits such as autonomy, personhood, or rational agency. In response to this objection, I concede that it is plausible to think that life typically has greater value for humans than animals. However, I argue that having an equal right to life does not require that life has equal value for a being but rather just that",

Exhilaration, gladness and interest arise from (a); ease, bliss and contentment from (b); uneasiness, distress and repugnance from (c), depression, sadness and apathy from (d). (2)These affects are due to (i) the organic harmony or discord induced by the environment; wherewith are evoked (ii) innately purposive patterns of out-going locomotor and organic activity, partly self-controlled and producing organic sensations; the latter again induce (iii) organic harmony or discord. Self-activity is “affected” by (i), (ii) and (iii). An innate basis is afforded by (i) and (ii) for the affect, which is completely developed by (iii) derived from actual expression. (3)Instincts are integrated from different higher and lower reflexes, emotions from different instincts, sentiments from different emotions organized within progressively higher systems and subjected to control and inhibition, which are important determinants of the accompanying feeling. In the lowest reflexes the self is “affected” only by (iii). The higher reflexes are accompanied by the affects evoked as described above in (2). Instincts, emotions and sentiments are accom panied by their special feelings depending on the integration of dispositions to lower feelings and on (ii) and (iii).",

      "abstract": "The shame response is a primitive physiological response to a rejection of oneself by another. The discomfort of this response may vary from intense physical pain to one that is barely noticeable, if at all. When this pain is sufficient, it causes anger that may be directed outward against another or inward against oneself. The intensity of the shame response, hence the intensity of the pain and anger, is related to the significance of the other, the significance of witnesses to the rejection, one's vulnerability, whether or not the rejection is of oneself or an aspect of oneself, and if the rejection comes as a surprise. When most intense (i.e., most painful), the shame response may include a tightness of the throat, nausea, stomach pain, and a sense that the contents of one's chest and abdomen are collapsing, exploding, or imploding. In reviewing what preceded an act of violence, it is necessary to determine whether the assailant had experienced a shame response and how intense it was. Understanding that a shame response can lead to anger and violence allows for the prevention of violence. This requires that individuals do not experience rejections that are so painful as to lead to violence.",

      "title": "PHILOSOPHY, ADVERTISING MYTHS AND MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Being concerned with current matters, ordinary man is used to have a regular approach on life, by means of efficiency oriented skills. Carried out by worries and hopes, he does not allow himself to breed the taste for speculation. Usually, his horizon of questions regarding man and life is often mistaken for the sphere of immediate needs – in what concerns its level, contents and solutions. Raising questions – when it happens and inasmuch as it happens – appears attached to unusual events (either good or bad) and, most of the time, just inasmuch as these require a certain effort in order to be integrated into what is called habits. Ordinary judgement is in terms of action and utility. The meaning of life is neither obsession, nor a release of passion, since physical and soul energies are oriented towards goals that do not allow somebody to appeal to reflection. Playing with abstract arguments is frightening, distracts from those acts that are experienced as obligations, and this is why it will be avoided, as much as possible. Self preservation instinct works well enough. Man has the taste for relativity; daily activities witness for the weaknesses of humanity and the powers of hazard, shaping his wisdom; life is intuitively taken as a value, and it is worth living even if there are no strong meanings; thus, life is above all ideas describing it. Daily life receives a immediate link between theory and practice, between knowledge and action; we live under the impulse of satisfying needs; this is why choosing goals and means cannot be endlessly suspended in order to make room for deliberative reflection; one makes appeal to already given knowledge and value instruments that have a certified efficiency. This is why daily subjective life oscillates between decisions founded on momentary, passing and inconsistent reasons and decisions determined by rigid grounds, although they seldom conceptually clarified (tradition, habits). Ordinary consciousness behaves like a receptacle: the knowledge of reality – taken as a mirroring of reality by thought and senses – remains at the stage of noticing and uncritical description of some empiric correlations, of factual observations, of some modes of external phenomenal manifestation. Realism that is based on the “logic of senses” combines with the concern for normative aspect of life and action. “Common sense – says Lucian Blaga – is due to some ideas acquired by human spirit in time, by means of living together with the others.

      "abstract": "When a person signs his or her name, he or she is carrying out one of the most common writing acts. With time and usage, a signature can become highly individualized, often in a style quite distinct from that of the writer's other handwriting. The complexity and consistency of an individual's signature does not reflect his or her education or intelligence. How each person writes depends upon the combined effect of a number of factors. Most marginally educated individuals produce a deliberate, awkward signature, lacking in skilland freedom, but nonetheless individual to the writer. With more proficient writers, the entire makeup of the signature assumes greater skill, movement becomes less primitive and elementary, and many letter designs approximate, to a greater or lesser degree, the copybook writing that the individual was taught. Just how a person writes his or her name depends upon numerous factors, such as muscular control, coordination, health, age, the frequency at which he or she is called upon to write, writing instrument, etc. Over time, all of these factors are blended into an individual's signature; a writer is almost never aware of any of these factors. Instead, through repetition, the writer executes an automatic formation of strokes, which usually but not always tends to assume a consistent pattern. Each signature varies to some degree from a master pattern and from other specimens of his or her signature. For the vast majority of individuals, signing one's name is a habitual act. The act of reproducing this piece of writing called a signature requires a minimum of concentration. Individuals can usually multi-task when signing their signature. The degree of variation among genuine signatures for each individual can range from slight to extreme. This is referred to as a range of variation and is an expected feature.",

We are saved sharing a relationship of love with God, whose love for us is visible throughout Jesus' life and especially in cross. Love requires freedom to choose and freedom to share. A person with power over me (for example, a drill sergeant, or a robber) can compel my obedience, but that person cannot compel my love.

John Booty considers that Chapter 56 of Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, titled The union or mutuall which is betweene Christ and Church of Christ in this present worlde, is theological heart and central chapter of Book V, and an epitome of Hooker's theology.4 In another publication, Booty states that Hooker's use of term participation provides a key to Hooker's meaning in Book V in terms of the mutual of deity and humanity in Christ enabling that mutual of Christ in us and we in Christ, which constitutes Christ's body, church. Booty notes that Hooker seems to interpret referring to koinonia or fellowship.5 In Chapter 56 of Book V of Laws, Hooker identifies different degrees of in Christ. All creation, humanity included, participates in Christ as creator. Hooker states that thinges which hath made are in that respect ofspringe of God, they are in him as effectes in theire highest cause, he likewise actuallie is in them, thassistance and influence of his deitie is theire life.6 But our in Christ is to exceed general of all creation in creator. Hooker urges that we may become sonnes of God in life of church, which we become living members of Body of Christ in world. of Christ in faithful and faithful in Christ means that by venue of this mysticall conjunction wee are of him and in him even as though our erie flesh and bones should be made continuate with his...

This has the consequence that one cannot sincerely assent to a prescription without becoming disposed to comply with it or to wish others to comply with it. The most obvious members of this class are those typically expressed in the imperative mood. The fact that many languages devote a grammatical mood specifically to this kind of speech act shows that their speakers assign a particular role to them. We must not assume, however. either that imperatives are the only kind of prescriptions, or that all imperatives are similar to each other in all their features, The imperative mood can be used to express military commands, polite requests, instructions for using hair-driers or cooking omelets or finding a friend’s house, entreaties, prayers. and any number of other kinds of prescriptive speech act. The most general term for speech acts of this kind is telling someone to do something, in contrast to telling him (or her) that something is the case. This applies even to prayers, where the speaker has no authority or power of enforcement, but is in a completely subordinate relation.",

More-cautious approaches maintain that the existence of pain and sin ought to make us skeptical about any such deity. Or that the extent of the suffering in the millions of years of sentient life on Earth gives us strong reason to think no such deity exists. Or that particular cases of extreme anguish and human cruelty make belief in this sort of deity irrational. And so on.",

Apart from these, even the case of action that seems self-destructive in its result need not be considered a failure of control. Of course, there are gamblers who lose, criminals who get caught, and addicts and drinkers who ruin their lives. They are people, often demoralized people, for whom talk of transcendence or delay of gratification is meaningless and for whom therefore the immediate relief or the short-term gain is what counts. In any case, it is a mistake to imagine, when we talk of so-called self-destructive action, that short-term gains and longterm consequences are always calculated. They are not. In fact, such calculations are often avoided: A few drinks, an abruptness of action with a quick completion, a rationalization that emphasizes the single and relatively safe instance of a general and risky pattern-all these diminish one's sensation of making a risky choice. They are ways in which people (some people particularly but all of us sometimes) can avoid asking themselves questions to which, they dimly suspect, the answers will be unpleasant.",

The primary goals of this research effort were to identify a variety of visuals found on tombstones, to look for patterns and categories of use, and to attempt to ascertain societal meanings of the these icons. Data collection entailed visiting 26 cemeteries in England, Scotland, and within the United States: Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. Symbols were grouped into several major classifications: (1) shapes and symbols, like various types of crosses; (2) fauna, such as doves; (3) humanoid forms, like representations of hands; (4) flora, like roses; (5) tools and implements, or anything that depicts life interests of the deceased, from golf clubs and automobiles to the cartoon dinosaur Barney; (6) scenes and landscapes; and (7) organizational insignias. Photographs of 24 headstones are included, with accompanying details about the location and date of the headstone, description of symbols and their history, and assessment of the symbols' cultural significance.

One of the two has just culpably killed an innocent person, but has no intention of killing anybody else and there is no reason to expect that he will. Everything else being equal, should we give them an equal chance of being saved by flipping a coin? In this paper I argue that we should not. I argue that the implications of a person's moral culpability for (recent or prospective) harm to a particular victim should transfer to other conflict situations in which the wrongdoer might find him or herself. This requires establishing the extent to which a person's contributing to harming another person — and his moral culpability for that harm — impinges on our decision making in situations where it is possible only to assist either the wrongdoer or some other person that is not his victim.",

It can justify beliefs, credences, and various other doxastic attitudes, such as suspecting that p. Evidence also legitimates emotions, decisions, and actions. A state might close a bridge, for example, based on evidence it is unstable. Evidence affects moral and legal matters, such as how we may permissibly treat people. Killing another person is usually legally and morally prohibited, for instance, but can be rendered permissible by compelling evidence that the person is an immediate serious threat to others. More mundanely, we might permissibly avoid a person, based on evidence they mistreat people. In addition to justifying beliefs, it also causes belief. It can be difficult to suspend judgement in the face of compelling evidence. Evidence plays significant roles in interpersonal relationships, including assigning blame and resolving disputes. It is paramount in law, science, journalism, and medical practice; it structures scholarly pursuits, such as historical investigation. More prosaically, evidence is how humans, higher animals, and (perhaps) robots navigate their environment. It is indispensable to thought. What kinds of things can be evidence? Candidates include facts, propositions, assertions, beliefs, knowledge, objects, states of affairs, and phenomenological experiences (§1). Pieces of evidence stand in intricate webs, with the overall epistemic force of a body of evidence depending on many interlocking factors (§2). Evidence can be undermined or reinforced by other evidence, and differing background knowledge licenses different inferences from a given piece of evidence. Evidence affects the justification of belief and other doxastic attitudes in various ways, and also influences epistemic practices, character, and institutions (§3).",

Whether he asks for counsel and information regarding his everyday needs or, far beyond any practical considerations, strives for insight, whether his concern is with the first or the last questions, he does only what he cannot leave undone. He can inquire into things ; he can question himself ; he can direct his questions to others or be interrogated by them ; he can run away from perplexing situations or turn his inquisitiveness to the uncovering of problems. In so doing, he only demonstrates and fulfills a basic mode of human existence. When he attempts to evade painful questions, to withdraw from « re-sponsibility », questions follow and pursue him even into sleep. They emerge from his past ; they threaten him from the future ; they haunt him in the present. Questions themselves never disappear, because questioning never ceases. Although particular questions can be transmitted to others and accepted by them as their own, the act of questioning cannot be taught. Nor does it require a teacher. The first question arises early in the life of every healthy child, from the very roots of its existence. We are able to ask single questions because we are questioning beings at our very core. We must therefore distinguish, though not separate, the relationship",

      "abstract": "Individual differences in pro-environmentalism (connectedness to nature, pro-environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior) have been attributed to various personality traits and, most recently, socially/ethically aversive (aka ‘dark’) traits in particular. However, the empirical picture linking such traits to pro-environmentalism is scattered and has produced contradictory findings. We propose a more parsimonious and consistent explanation of individual differences in pro-environmentalism through the D factor, the common core of all aversive traits. Across 12 studies (total N = 13,882) we show substantial and consistent negative correlations (−0.56 ≤ r ≤ −0.26) between D and connectedness to nature, pro-environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. Moreover, the ‘dark tetrad’ traits (Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy, and Sadism), alone or in their common combinations (as a triad or tetrad), never explained more total variance in either of these criteria than D alone. Finally, the extent to which any dark tetrad trait was negatively associated with pro-environmentalism was entirely due to D. These findings bear implications for the broader nature of pro-environmentalism and theoretical parsimony in research on individual differences in pro-environmentalism.",

      "abstract": "Extract If he thought he was making a prophesy, or even just expressing a hope, with the title Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche was certainly fooled. Today more than ever, above all in political language, good and evil (especially the latter) are omnipresent terms, imminent personifications of our fears and hopes. Not as adverbs,1Close which would perhaps be grammatically correct—such as in the common expressions “How is it going? Good, thanks, not bad”; or, “Today was a bad day”—but as substantives, as if one were dealing with rather precise beings to encourage or to fight. They were good times when “Evil” [Il male] could be used as the title of a satirical newspaper; today no one would ever think up such a title. Today, usually by carrying out—even in good faith—an ideological falsification, one speaks increasingly often of a struggle between good and evil, of an “evil empire” from which we must defend ourselves, that we will have to isolate and render harmless. This also occurs often by pointing out that whoever does not believe that the adverb refers to a noun has become an instrument of the devil, whose cunning consists precisely (like that of the mafia) in making one believe that he does not exist.",

      "title": "The Meaning(s) of Sound(s)",
      "abstract": "Abstract The meaning of sound for our lives and actions depends largely on the experience we have had with them, partly also on the context in which they occur. Sound events that humans and other animals can hear on earth are usually created by physical movement in the environment. Meaning implies that at least one (direct) relationship exists between the specific acoustic properties, and the perception of a sound, often associated with a second relationship: the perception of the sound and the identification of its source, e.g., a creaking door. And a third relation is usually associated, too: I like or dislike it (the sound and/or the source). Some relationships are rather trivial and are usually shared by a large cultural community. Other connections apply only in small groups of people (e.g., a neighborhood with a common history), and in extreme cases, only in a single person in a particular situation (e.g., a violin expert testing violins). This chapter starts with what dictionaries say about the word “sound” and the distinction between sound and noise. The next section deals with sounds as source of information. The last section describes the many non-acoustic influences on the meaning of sounds and noise, i.e., physical factors (e.g., color, object size, and motion), and personal factors (e.g., noise sensitivity, personal control, evaluation of the source, trust in the agents responsible, and expectations for the future acoustic development).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aquinas sometimes says that matter specifies a human action, and frequently uses ‘matter’ as an alternative term for ‘object’. He does not hold that all matter can determine a human action’s species, but only that matter to which an action is specially related, called the ‘matter about which’ an action takes place or its ‘due’/‘undue’ matter. Aquinas has two different ways of explaining how matter can specify. On occasion, he argues that just as particular kinds of matter predispose for certain substantial forms (for instance, only flesh and bones can accommodate the human soul), so the distinctive characters of things willed predispose for certain kinds of human actions and habits (for example, pleasures of touch predispose for temperance, not courage). In other contexts, Aquinas uses explanations more familiar in his moral teaching: he says that matter specifies because a human agent wills some matter as an end, or because matter possesses a distinctive formal aspect (like an object’s).",

      "title": "Cold Case Evaluation Model III: Missing Persons",
      "abstract": "There are many advantages to reviewing a case that is \"cold\" rather than \"hot\": chief among them being that in most cases, a homicide has occurred and the body of the victim has been recovered and identified. Conversely, in cold cases involving missing persons, although the victim's identity is known, the body has not yet been recovered. The lack of a victim's body presents daunting challenges to investigators. First, without a body it is unclear if the victim is deceased. Second, without a victim's body investigators may not be able to determine where the individual originally disappeared from, thus they cannot make an accurate assessment of the crime scene and the risk level of the offender. Additionally, if the body of a victim is not recovered at the time a case review is commenced, it is impossible to narrow the field of suspects when considering who may have had access to the site where the victim disappeared from, the homicide site, and the dump site (if in fact all these locations are independent of one another). Last, without the recovery of a body, there is often a complete lack of physical, forensic evidence.",

However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some \"primordial\" form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans.",

      "abstract": "Human body consists of three basic components they are Dosha, Dhatu and Mala. Each of these constituent plays different role in the body. Out of these three parts ‘Mala’ can be defines as ‘Malinikarnat Mala’, the entity which develops impurities in body. These ‘Mala’ are three in number; they are like ‘Purisha, Mutra and Sweda’. Out of these ‘Purisha’ (solid waste/stool) has vital role in body mechanism. Ancient Sages also stated that Mana (Mind) is a part of human body. This Mana does three functions Dhee (grasp), Dhriti (Understanding) Smriti (Presentation). For healthy being it is necessary that these three functions perform well. It is observed that the person suffering from Asamyaka Mala (Improper formation of stool) leads to various types of diseases especially it does impact on functions of Mana, like Vaichitya - Dhee hani, Smriti nash (loss of memory). It is also observed that Pitta Dosha and Purisha had relation and Pitta do play important role in Smriti. This Smritinash many times leads to formation of serious psychosomatic conditions in body which ultimately end up into untreatable condition.\r\n\r\nTherefore in this paper an attempt is made to understand relation between Asamyaka Mala and its impact on Smriti. It’s association between healthy and unhealthy stage of life. This is a literature study.",

      "title": "Human Flourishing Versus Desire Satisfaction",
      "abstract": "What is the good for human persons? If I am trying to lead the best possible life I could lead, not the morally best life, but the life that is best for me, what exactly am I seeking? This phrasing of the question I will be pursuing may sound tendentious, so some explanation is needed. What is good for one person, we ordinarily suppose, can conflict with what is good for other persons and with what is required by morality. A prudent person seeks her own good efficiently; she selects the best available means to her good. If we call the value that a person seeks when she is being prudent “prudential value,” then an alternative rendering of the question to be addressed in this essay is “What is prudential value?” We can also say that an individual flourishes or has a life high in well-being when her life is high in prudential value. Of course, these common-sense appearances that the good for an individual, the good for other persons, and the requirements of morality often are in conflict might be deceiving. For all that I have said here, the correct theory of individual good might yield the result that sacrificing oneself for the sake of other people or for the sake of a morally worthy cause can never occur, because helping others and being moral always maximize one's own good. But this would be the surprising result of a theory, not something we should presuppose at the start of inquiry. When a friend has a baby and I express a conventional wish that the child have a good life, I mean a life that is good for the child, not a life that merely helps others or merely respects the constraints of morality. After all, a life that is altruistic and perfectly moral, we suppose, could be a life that is pure hell for the person who lives it—a succession of horrible headaches marked by no achievements or attainments of anything worthwhile and ending in agonizing death at a young age. So the question remains, what constitutes a life that is good for the person who is living it?",

      "abstract": "Skeletal trauma refers to the damage inflicted to the bone, teeth or other human hard tissues. Human body, often, encounter traumatic insults at various stages before and after the death due to certain accidental or intentional acts of homicide or suicide or sometimes due to certain taphonomic factors. Beside establishing biological identity of unknown human remains, anthropologists are routinely involved in reconstruction of death scenes by understanding and interpreting the traumatic/taphonomic lesions imprinted to the recovered human remains. Each type of trauma imprints unique signatures as the mechanism of production of injuries is different with respect to force, angle, direction, tool used, morphology of bone etc. Traumatic injuries caused either during life time (ante-mortem) or just before the death (peri-mortem) can be related to events or circumstances surrounding death whereas post-mortem traumatic signatures may reflect the taphonomic damages or destructions of human remains. Trauma analysis is required to explain various facts like timing of trauma, cause and mechanism of trauma and circumstances around time of death and hence identification of the deceased. The information presented in this review article will provide proper understanding and ability to interpret the skeletal injuries for determining the mechanism and timing of bone trauma required in medicolegal death investigations. Traumatic injuries on the frontal bone, femurs and clavicles corroborated the heinous treatment of Ajnala victims before their death, the comprehensive trauma analysis was not possible due to badly damaged and fragmented nature of retrieved human remains consequent upon their non-scientific exhumation by some amateur archaeologists. Thus, safe and expert-mediated excavation of human remains found in forensic contexts becomes essential to reveal their traumatic history (if any) prior to death.",

The Holy Qur'an repeatedly mentions Tribulation in different ways and in different words. The abundance of verses on the subject of Tribulation indicates the importance of this subject. Natural disasters are a set of harmful events that have no human origin. These events are usually unpredictable or, at least for a long time, cannot be predicted. The natural disasters mentioned in the Qur'an are: floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, lightning, death and life, famine and starvation, locust attacks, frog attacks, loss of property and wealth. When one of the natural disasters occurs in the life of an individual or a group of people, it can have several effects. The training effects of natural disasters are: increasing faith, identifying benefactors, thinking and teaching, increasing patience and perseverance, decreasing arrogance and increasing humility, returning to the right path, increasing thanks-giving, stimulating competition sense, growth and excellence of human to achieve high positions of the hereafter.",

Among the variety of behavioral forms in animals, in dogs in particular, a special place is occupied by behaviors that are expressed in the form of aggression. Establishing the place of unmotivated (idiopathic) aggression of animals (dogs) in this series, as behavior, is important when developing certain legislative acts that determine a certain attitude towards animals in general, especially aggressive in their behavior towards humans. When solving issues regarding humane and responsible attitude towards animals, in relation to the concept of “unmotivated aggression of animals” it is necessary to understand what animal behavior is, forms of their behavior, whether unmotivated aggression of animals is a particular form of behavior. In general, unmotivated aggression in an animal (dog) should be understood as its defensive behavior, expressed in going beyond the stereotypical behavior typical of an animal of a given species and manifested in the form of aggression towards a person and (or) an animal, not caused by any external cause (factor).",

      "abstract": "The usual lazy and short way by chastisement and the rod, which is the only instrument of government that tutors generally know, or even think of, is the most unfit of any to be used in education, because it tends to both these mischiefs. First, this kind of punishment contributes not at all to the mastery of our natural propensity to indulge corporal and present pleasure, and to avoid pain at any rate, but rather encourages it, and thereby strengthens that in us which is the root from whence spring all vicious actions and the irregularities of life. Secondly, this sort of correction naturally breeds an aversion to that which it is the tutor9s business to create a liking to ... Thirdly, such a sort of slavish discipli e makes a slavish temper. The child submits, and dissembles obedience, whilst the fear of the rod hangs over him. But when that is removed, and by being out of sight, he can promise himself impunity, he gives the greater scope to his natural inclination; which by this way is not at all altered, but, on the contrary, heightened and increased in him; and after such restraint breaks out usually with the more violence. Or, fourthly, if severity carried to the highest pitch does prevail and works a cure on the present unruly distemper, it often brings in the room of it a worse and more dangerous disease, by breaking the mind; and then in the place of a disorderly young fellow, you have a low-spirited moped creature, who, however with his unnatural sobriety he may please silly people who commend tame and inactive children because they make no noise nor give them any trouble, yet at last will probably prove as uncomfortable a thing to his friends as he will be all his life a useless thing to himself and others.",

      "abstract": "Regions of social importance (i.e., other people) attract attention in real world scenes, but it is unclear how automatic this bias is and how it might interact with other guidance factors. To investigate this, we recorded eye movements while participants were explicitly instructed to avoid looking at one of two objects in a scene (either a person or a non-social object). The results showed that, while participants could follow these instructions, they still made errors (especially on the first saccade). Crucially, there were about twice as many erroneous looks towards the person than there were towards the other object. This indicates that it is hard to suppress the prioritization of social information during scene viewing, with implications for how quickly and automatically this information is perceived and attended to.",

And if anyone detracts from this in any way, he is usually no less, but in fact often more upset than if some harm is done to his body or things. Although this esteem is heightened by various causes, its primary basis seems to be human nature itself. Indeed, the very word ‘man’ is thought to contain a certain dignity, and the ultimate as well as the most effective argument for deflecting others’ rude insults is taken to be: “Surely I am not a dog or a beast, but as much a man as you.”",

      "title": "Animalizar y mecanizar: dos formas de deshumanización",
      "abstract": "Dehumanization is defined as people?s tendency to perceive the outgroup as being less human than the ingroup (for reviews, see Haslam, Loughnan, Kashima, & Bain, 2008; Leyens, Demoulin, Vaes, Gaunt, & Paladino, 2007, Vaes, Leyens, Paladino and Pires Miranda, 2012). Thus, it might be thought that groups that are denied humanness will be discriminated against to a greater degree than groups considered to be fully human (Vala, Pereira and Leyens, 2009). Indeed, as Leyens et al. (2007) pointed out, this process has subtle and important consequences in our daily lives that can affect intergroup relations. \nFurthermore, according to Haslam (2006), dehumanization can be manifested in two forms: animalistic and mechanistic. In his model, the author posited how individuals can be likened to animals, and hence, they will be perceived as unintelligent, immoral, coarse or uncivilized. Likewise, people can also be seen as robots or machines, in which case, they will be perceived as cold, rigid, mechanical, or lacking emotions or agency. \nThe present dissertation used the model by Haslam in order to analyse and compare these two forms of dehumanization. In our analysis, we will attempt to clarify how animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization affect intergroup relations. This insight was the basis for the development of different empirical studies that form part of this thesis. Accordingly, the chapters included in this dissertation are built on experimental research and show some results related to the different senses of humanness, the creation of new procedures to capture them and discriminate between animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization, and the study of the consequences that both forms of dehumanization have on different interpersonal and intergroup measures.\nThe thesis is structured in four chapters. The first chapter is a theoretical review of the most relevant literature on infrahumanization and dehumanization. Specifically, it provides theoretical support for the main sections included in this dissertation: the different senses of humanness; the various forms of measuring animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization; the consequences of dehumanization reported in the literature. The second chapter includes the main goals set in the thesis, as well as our hypotheses. The reader will find the empirical part of the dissertation from chapter 3 onwards. Eleven studies are presented across four papers. Lastly, in the fourth chapter, we discuss the main findings and analyse the theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and also some ideas for future research. \nIt should be noted that the papers presented in the third chapter of the thesis were written with the intention of being submitted for publication, therefore, certain explanations of basic concepts and theories inevitably appear several times. Additionally, in order to fulfill the requirements of the International PhD program at Granada University, some chapters were written in Spanish (chapter 1), and others in English (chapters 2, 3 and 4).",

      "abstract": "In Chapter 13 of the Leviathan on “The Natural Condition, of Mankind” is found Hobbes' doctrine of the state of nature as it is generally known. This may be briefly summed up as follows: In faculties of mind and body, men are, on the whole, so nearly equal that one cannot claim for himself any benefit to which another may not pretend as well as he. From this equality of ability arises equality of hope in attaining ends desired. “And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies.” There are three principal causes of quarrel among men; first, the desire for gain; second, for safety, and third, for glory. Hence where there is no common power to keep men in awe, “they are in that condition called war, and such a war as is of every man against every man.” This war need not be constant conflict, since “the nature of war consists not in actual fighting, but in the known disposition thereto during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary.” In such a state of war, actual or potential, the condition of man is most unfortunate and deplorable. “The life of man in such a state,” says Hobbes, “is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”",

The purpose of this presented work is to (a) list and describe these 25 Life APPs, (b) show how they can be interspersed into standard physiology courses, and (c) to offer a currently used “Matching Quiz”, constructed within Brightspace (D2L), as an aid in students in learning these concepts. The 25 Life APPs include the “top ten”: Positive and Negative Feedback; Structure and Function relationships; Mortality vs Morbidity; Physiology as Applied Physics; Acute vs Chronic actions, Symptoms or Signs vs Causes; Human Body was better optimized for past environmental conditions; Effects of biological rhythms on general physiology; Primary Effect vs Side Effects; Why do most people think that the average female body is physically inferior to the average male body and why they are wrong. The remaining fifteen Life APPs are: Why some biological processes are simple and others complex; Why all sustained evolved structures have both advantages and disadvantages; Why various biological processes and organisms evolve; You, Free Will and Consciousness; How we know what is real or true vs false; Where the mind stops and the brain or body begins; Prevention over Correction; Redundancy aids in Safety; Difficulties of Borders and Interfaces; The ABCs of critical care; Defining death; Digestive consequences of having evolved in a different environment; GI track optimized for symbiotic bacteria; Why so many bad side effects when we take medicines to solve primary medical issues; Why these Life AAPs are worth remembering. These 25 Life APPs are integrated into he presentations within a 1 st year 2 nd semester course in A&amp;P, as well as the advanced undergraduate course in animal or medical physiology at the University of Maine. They can be adapted, in part or in whole, to any undergraduate or graduate physiology course. They are easily modifiable or selectively parsed. In addition to interspersing them, where appropriate, into standard systems physiology courses, I either assign them or grant extra credit for completing them within a Matching Quiz embedded within Brightspace (D2L). How this is currently done will be demonstrated during the presentation. The author is willing and prepared to share their Brightspace courses used for both IN CLASS and ONLINE teaching. In sum, 25 unifying (physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and all systems covered in physiology) concepts are described and coined as “Life APPs” (All Purpose Principles). These Life APPs have been integrated into standard lectures as well as in a stand-alone Brightspace Matching Quiz. These are made freely available to teachers of biology or physiology.

      "title": "Disaster victim identification: Stable isotope analysis and the identification of unknown decedents",
      "abstract": "Within the complex world of disaster victim identification, or DVI, forensic science practitioners use a variety of investigative techniques to work toward a common goal: identification of the decedents, bringing closure to the affected communities. Identification is a complex undertaking; the event (disaster) also can be extraordinarily complex, as it may be an acute event, or one that spans months or years. Compounding this time issue, remains may be heavily fragmented, dispersed, commingled, or otherwise disrupted by either the perpetrators or the disaster itself. To help solve these complexities, we explore the use of stable isotope analysis (SIA) in DVI events. SIA can be used with a variety of body tissues (hair, nail, bone, and teeth), and each represents different time depths in a decedent's life. Bone collagen and tooth enamel carbonate are useful to reconstruct an individual's diet and source water intakes, respectively, leading to likely population or geographic origin determinations. Additionally, the carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of bone collagen have calculated intraperson ranges. These facts allow investigators to determine likely origin of remains using isotopic data and can be used to link skeletal elements (to an individual), or perhaps more importantly, show that remains are not linked. Application of SIA can thus speed remains identification by eliminating individuals from short lists for identification, linking or decoupling remains, and reducing the need for some DNA testing. These strategies and hypothesis tests should commence early in the DVI process to achieve maximum effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "What can an attention to affect offer those of us who continue to be engaged by criticism, who do it for a living or find it indispensable for some other reasons? For one thing, thinking about affect can change what counts as material and what material might do. I am using word material in psychoanalytic sense to mean the patient's words and behaviour as a whole, in so far as they offer a sort of raw material for interpretations and constructions.1 Affect is part of what an analyst or critic considers in order to build a convincing interpretation (of a lived scene, of a literary or cultural text): one sign that I am performing a good reading or interpreting well is if this reading helps me to understand why I feel a certain way, or why a text makes me feel this way. This is especially case if a feeling is counterintuitive or perverse in sense that it undermines or is simply outside of what I recognize to be my own desires or wishes. Affects or feelings fit psychoanalytic bill perfectly when they are felt to be, as Laplanche and Pontalis put it, somewhat alien ... as far as conscious subject is concerned (246); when they are considered incommensurate with [a subject's] conscious motives (246), they become material for analysis, symptomatic of unconscious wishes, for example, or structures.",

Physical survival and the negotiation of social situations constantly require that we act or abstain from acting. The latter can be, of course, construed as a form of action. The kernel of a circus action is the implementation of a physically challenging plan but such actions are performed within a cluster of verbal, musical, and visual modifiers whose deliberate purpose is to make the actions appear easier or more difficult and dangerous than they actually are. The attitudes and behaviour of the assistants who monitor aerial acts from the ground play a significant part in construing modality of an action as particularly dangerous. Trainers belong to two different categories depending on whether they deal with domestic animals of higher status like dogs and horses or wild animals which qualify them as able to perform the impossible.",

      "title": "The Inevitable Pursuit of the Will and the Problem of Merit According to Thomas Aquinas",
      "abstract": "Man's will necessarily pursues what is in accordance with its nature, and accidentally pursues what does not. Since the will pursues whatever it does in accordance with the good or ultimate purpose, it inevitably pursues formal good in general or the ultimate purpose. And the will inevitably pursues existence, preservation of life, social cooperation, and the pursuit of truth according to man's nature. The methods for realizing these goals are chosen haphazardly. However, when the ends according to these natures are in conflict with each other, the will chooses and pursues one by chance. In particular, in the case of the ultimate goal, it includes not only the aspect of self-completion but also the method of realization, and the will has freedom of execution regarding which method of realization the ultimate goal includes. The will can pursue or reject an ultimate goal whose method of realization is worldly values such as pleasure or wealth, or an ultimate goal whose method of realization is goodness itself. In this way, the ultimate goal that the will knows with freedom of execution is inevitably pursued. Because the will has freedom of action in knowing this ultimate end, these activities can be the object of moral merit. Obtaining faith by God's grace and achieving beatific vision in heaven are also inevitably accepted by the will when God's help is provided. When the grace of faith is given, it cannot be refused, and the will cannot be given freedom of action when preparing to accept it. The human will cannot exercise any freedom of choice or action under these conditions. So, although ‘free will in a broad sense’ can be recognized in the will, it is difficult to give merit to such activities. In heaven, the beatified person does not reject the beatific vision but inevitably pursues it because he has a firm inclination toward goodness. However, in order for the beatified person to have a firm inclination toward goodness, a person must have faith and make efforts in accordance with the correct ultimate goal in this life. The virtue achieved through such efforts in this life is not only the grace of God, but also the freedom of practice as ‘free will in a narrow sense’. These activities can be a contribution to the beatific vision achieved in the afterlife. The degree of supernatural virtue and beatific intuition of the beatified person in heaven varies depending on the grace given initially and the merits formed afterwards.",

      "abstract": "In my Practical Reality I argued that the reasons for which we act are not to be conceived of as psychological states of ourselves, but as real (or maybe only supposed) states of the world. The main reason for saying this was that only thus can we make sense of the idea that it is possible to act for a good reason. The good reasons we have for doing this action rather than that one consist mainly of features of the situations in which we find ourselves; they do not consist in our believing certain things about those situations. For instance, the reason for my helping that person is that she is in trouble and I am the only person around. It is not that I believe both that she is in trouble and that I am the only person around. Give that the (good) reason to help is that she is in trouble etc., it must be possible for my reason for helping to be just that, if it is indeed possible for one to act for a good reason. In fact, this sort of thing must be the normal arrangement. The reasons why we act, therefore, that is, our reasons for doing what we do, are not standardly to be conceived as states of ourselves, but as features of our situations.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes in THE CONCEPT OF MIND Gilbert Ryle describes what he is up to in a way which is quite unhelpful. The following passage will serve as an example of what I mean: To talk of a person’s mind is not to talk of a repository which is permitted to house objects that something called ‘the physical world’ is forbidden to house; it is to talk of the person’s abilities, liabilities and inclinations to do and undergo certain sorts of things, and of the doing and undergoing of these things in the ordinary world, (p. 199) I call this passage unhelpful because it commits the fallacy of false alternatives. It would have us think that talk of a person's mind is either (1) talk of a special non-physical repository or else (2) talk of a person's abilities, liabilities, inclinations, etc.—but not both. Yet surely talk of the mind as a non-physical repository might be one way of talking about a person's abilities, liabilities, inclinations, etc. Perhaps what Ryle should have said is that to speak of the mind as a non-physical repository that houses special, mental objects is a figurative way of putting what could be reported literally in talk of a person’s abilities, liabilities, inclinations, etc. Certainly that is a point Ryle tries to make in his book. Indeed it is a major burden of THE CONCEPT OF MIND to identify and analyze those figures of speech, or tropes, in which mental activities and capacities are commonly reported and described. The idea seems to be that we are misled philosophically by our failure to recognize the tropological character of what we commonly say about the mind and by our naivete as to how the tropes work.",

      "title": "Severe Spinal Cord Injury: A Case Study",
      "abstract": "SEVERE SPINAL CORD INJURY: A CASE STUDY BY ABUL FADL MOHSIN EBRAHIM* INTRODUCTION Any attempt to save life in general is considered to be a dignified duty and the Qur’ān alludes to this as follows: ‘. . . and whoever saves the life of a human being, it is as if he has saved the life of all of humankind . . .’ (Al-Ma’idah, 5:32) This Qu’ānic verse can justifiably be used to make a case for attempting to sustain life even by means of placing a patient on a ventilator or other life-sustaining devices. On the basis of analogy (qiyas) then, not to make use of extraordinary means to remove the distress of the patient would be in contravention of the above Qu’ānic imperative pertaining to the importance of saving human lives. But, Muslims should not lose sight of the fact that resorting to extraordinary means to sustain life does not in any way ‘prolong’ life. Islam teaches us that death is inevitable and will occur at the time decreed for it by Allah and the Qu’ān endorses this reality: And for all people a term (ajal) has been set. And when the end of the term approaches, they can neither delay it by a single moment, nor can they hasten it. (Al-Munafiqun, 63:11) Referring to the inevitability of death, Ibn Sina’ states: ‘It should be remembered that knowledge of health preservation helps neither in avoiding death nor in escaping from external afflictions. It also does not provide means of extending life indefinitely.’1 CASE SCENARIO Mr T.K. is a 26-year-old man who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained a severe injury to the spinal cord at the C3 level (3rd cervical vertebral level). He was unable to breathe, or to move his hands and legs. He was urgently intubated, that is, a tube was inserted into his trachea, in order to support his airway, and he was immediately ventilated by the ambulance personnel. Thereafter , he was transferred to a major metropolitan hospital, where he went assessment and examination by the attending neurosurgeon. He was found to have a complete spinal cord injury at the 3rd cervical level, thus meaning that he had no likelihood of recovering any function in his hands or legs. He would also be unable to breathe unassisted, that is, he would require ventilation on a lifelong * University of Kwazulu-Natal, Durban. 1 Ibn Sina, Abu cAli Husayn, n.d.

Mr T.K. did not sustain a head injury and was fully conscious and was unable to speak because of the tube in his mouth. However, he was able to understand events around him. Mr T.K. was admitted into the ICU unit for ventilation. A decision had to be made as to how long to ventilate Mr T.K. Since he was not married his elderly parents were called in to discuss the case. Mr T.K. could only communicate by means of fluttering his eyelids. His long-term prognosis was of course very poor. Patients who are completely quadriplegic are likely to develop life-threatening complications such as pneumonia, urinary infections or bedsores, all of which lead to an early demise. It is also very expensive to ventilate such patients on a prolonged basis. There was no likelihood Mr T.K.’s prognosis would improve in the future. Although a portable ventilator could be utilized in the long term to ventilate Mr T.K. at home, he would nevertheless be unable to move any part of his body from his neck downwards. QUESTIONS 1. Was it prudent on the part of the ambulance personnel who initially assessed Mr T.K. to intubate and ventilate him in the first instance? 2. Once the neurosurgeon had assessed that Mr T.K. had severe spinal cord damage with no likelihood of...",

Your attention might be drawn more towards certain objects first and then wander around taking in the remaining objects. Very rarely will your visual system need to pause and take more time to investigate what a particular object is – even more rarely will it not be able to interpret it at all (perhaps the four-horned statue in the back of the room will be confusing at first, but it still can be interpreted as a type of four-legged, hoofed animal).

      "title": "The Purpose of Personal Value",
      "abstract": "It seems as if there are things that have what we might call personal value—special objects, artwork by our children, etc. This term is meant to mark a difference between things whose value seems tied to a particular person, as opposed to things (like the Mona Lisa) that are valuable, period. The concept of personal value hasn’t received much focused attention, but I believe that it is of not only theoretical, but practical importance. In this paper, I explore the practical angle, arguing that personal value is important to our ability to make sense of ourselves. I give several desiderata for an account of personal value, and use examples to raise questions for Toni Ronnow-Rasmussen’s recent analysis of personal value. This practical stance leads me to offer an amendment to this analysis. It seems as though some things have what we might call personal value. That is, their value seems particularly tied to a specific person in a way that other valuable things are not. That is, the value of things like your favorite mug or your child’s scribbly drawing seems different from the value of the Mona Lisa and social justice. The former don’t have much (if any) value in the grand scheme of things, but the latter do. But we wouldn’t want to say that your favorite mug isn’t valuable; it might have quite a bit of value to you. This difference hasn’t received much concentrated attention in philosophical literature, but I think it is of not only theoretical, but practical interest. It is the practical angle I wish to explore in this paper. In particular, I want to argue that the purpose of a notion of personal value is to help us sort what is important to us from what is not—and that we need this concept in order to make sense of our lives. A sense of the practical significance of the notion should, then, shape an account of it, and at the end of the paper I offer some suggestions toward this end. To get directly to the point, I claim that the reason we need a notion of personal value is that impersonal value is pervasive and overwhelming and we can’t adequately respond to it all. One way to think of the problem that hoarders have is that they have difficulty letting things go because they not only recognize value in the most mundane objects, but also have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility to respond to that value—in particular, by possessing and keeping the objects. But hoarding is just an extreme case of clutter, which is (so I think) the result of a tendency most of us have: the tendency to appreciate value. This is a basic fact of life. Creatures as sophisticated as we are have cognitive and emotional capacities that are deeply intertwined, and which allow for a great deal of nuance in our perception, recognition, and 1 Cite Bennett Helm. 2 appreciation of value. We find value in things beyond those that satisfy our basic needs; we are uplifted by sunsets, we fight for freedom and justice, we care about other people. In this sense, we think that there are things that matter, period. This mattering doesn’t have to be grand; things can matter in minor ways, for instance by being useful for everyday life (as, for instance, can openers are). These things that matter have impersonal value, that is, value that is not specifically related to particular valuers, or that we value without reference to anything or anyone else. In addition to the many specific valuing attitudes, we are capable of a great many different actions in response to the recognition of value. For instance, considering just one example, recognition of the value of art can range from believing that art is a good thing, to visiting art museums, to collecting art, to lobbying for legislation to fund the National Endowment for the Arts. Given the enormous range of objects in the world (including abstract ones like justice), their manifold shades of significance, and the wide range of appropriate responses to this significance, the world should seem overwhelmingly full of value, much the way it is overwhelmingly full of light, color and noise to a newborn baby. But it doesn’t. Just as a baby learns to focus attention and differentiate objects from one another, we learn to focus our valuing and concentrate on just some of the value in the world, adopting it as our own. We take out a stake in it, so to speak. This attachment to some valuable things is what makes it possible to operate successfully in the world. So we can think of personal value as a kind of attention: it helps us to pick out of the “blooming, buzzing confusion” the things that matter most to us. This serves in contexts as concrete as clearing out the clutter in our living and working spaces, or as broad and abstract as the architecture of our personal lives, and on many levels in between. To begin to understand the idea of personal value, let’s look at a sample of things that seem, at least on the surface, to have it. My favorite example is my raggedy old stuffed pink rabbit Pete. He was my favorite toy when I was a child, and as a result his fur is worn off and his tail is hanging by a thread; surely no one who didn’t know me would find him valuable, and the only reason that those who do know me will value him is derived from my valuing him. He is something that has virtually no impersonal value, but a great deal of personal value. He has what we often term “sentimental” value. What else can have personal value? The laptop I’m using to write this has a great deal of personal value to me, but it is not at all like Pete’s sentimental value. This computer contains files that are important to me for both personal and professional reasons. Although my important files are backed up, the loss of this computer would be quite significant, because it is an important tool that I use nearly all the time. But unlike Pete, nothing hinges on its being this particular computer. I could, with reasonable ease, transfer all of the files that matter to me to another computer. Then that computer would take on the significance that this one has. What matters is that I have a computer, not that I have this computer. The photograph of stones under the rippling water of Lake Superior that hangs above our kitchen table also has personal value to me. There are a number of reasons for this, but the one I want to highlight has to do with the fact that I find it visually appealing. Again, unlike Pete, nothing",

And, without doubt, not done out of habit.\r\nThis does not mean that one is helpless before the thing thus produced. Rather, that the object’s conditions become unexpected. It provokes an anomaly. Something that is underground starts to emerge – arbitrary choices, misleading decisions, mistakes provided for. An outline.\r\nNot that humility would become these things’ final sanctuary. On an emotional level, some objects might suggest a need for support. Care. Looking-after. Perhaps a homeopathic ambition. On a material or visual level, the opposite might be true. Dumb material, daft, unhygienic, contaminated with something else. Beyond rescue. The line between those two levels is precarious – sometimes overwhelming and untrustworthy.",

      "abstract": "Bahwa sesungguhnya apa yang menjadi keinginan dan kebutuhan manusia itu bukan hanya terbatas pada kebutuhan makan, minum, pakaian atau kenikmatan-kenikmatan lainnya. Berdasarkan hasil riset dan observasi, mereka mengambil kesimpulan bahwa pada diri manusia terdapat semacam keinginan dankebutuhan yang bersifat universal. Kebutuhan ini melebihi kebutuhan yang lainnya bahkan mengatasi kebutuhan akan kekuasaan. Keinginan akan kebutuhan tersebut merupakan kebutuhan kodrati yaitu berupa keinginan untuk mencintai dan dicintai Tuhan. Karena adanya fitrah ini, maka manusia selalu membutuhkan pegangan hidup yang disebut agama. Rumusan masalah dalam penelitian ini adalah; 1. Benarkah kehidupan manusia dalam masyarakat banyak mengalami kegoncangan, 2. Sejauhmana peran agama dalam perilaku manusia serta pengaruhnya terhadap ketenangan dan ketentraman batin atau jiwa manusia. Analisa datanya menggunakan sintesa-analisa dan induksi-deduksi. Kesimpulan penelitian ini adalah; 1. Dalam kehidupan modern, terlalu banyak manusia yang membanggakan rasio, materi yang ada pada akhirnya dapat menjerumuskan manusia kejurang yang sangat dalam, yang mengakibatkan manusia memalingkan diri dari hal-hal yang bersifat supra natural. Dalam kehidupan manusia modern yang telah kehilangan jati dirinya, berjalan nyaris tanpa pedoman yang kokoh yang membuatnya sangat ringkih dan mudah terombang ambing dalam seribu satu krisis. 2. Agama mempunyai peran yang sangat penting dalam kehidupan manusia. Agama memberikan ketenangan dan ketentraman serta kedamaian batin. Dalam kaitannya dengan perilaku agama mengandung norma-norma dan etika yang akan mengarahkan manusia kepada jalan yang benar. Ketenangan dan ketentraman batin itu diperoleh dengan jalan dzikrullah",

      "abstract": "Man has always had to fight for his survival. From a certain perspective, human history is a long series of human attempts to progress in the search for better and more stable life conditions. However, since many obstacles and many dangers threaten his life, man is confronted daily with very many threats against his existence and with the ultimate threat of death. If one is flesh, then one is definitely and continually under the threat of death and decay. Our own body can become a source of threats against ourselves when the pathologic processes change its structure and integrity. All human beings are under a threat that is rather within the being than outside it. By experiencing the decay of his own body, man knows that his existence in this world is problematic even beyond any external threats. Within his being, man bears the necessity of his end and thus fear shoots ever deeper roots into this profound experience of corruptibility that makes man feel the sting of death even when he creates life. In the words of the Bible, the Son of God “became flesh” (John 1.14) to redeem man from this condition to the immortality for which he was created. Confronting man with his death is the key of the process that imposes a new way in which he relates to his own truth and life, which can only be lived to its fullest as a gift from Above.",

As a result of this, different clothing styles can evoke different connotations based on the viewers assumption of the ideals of the groups or contexts that the wearer’s clothing connects them to, such as formal office dress and LGBTQ+ fashions, whether by choice or by pressure. Also, through dress individuals can internalize these ideals of the group, to influence their view of themselves, and in turn how they interact with the outside world. Furthermore, clothing can also highlight a person’s individuality through failure to conform, evoking a different individual-world interaction. Regardless, an individual’s desire to express themselves and externalize the internal can lead to clothing construction or altering to better represent themselves, and/or their relationship to a group.",

      "title": "Figures of Evil in the Business World",
      "abstract": "When you ask people What is evil?, their responses are striking in several respects. They tend to name individuals, singling out certain people as evil?e.g., Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, or Joseph Stalin. They typically view evil as inhering in people or in quasi-personal agents (e.g., devils or vampires), not in animals or natural forces. Respondents never describe themselves as evil or as in any way complicitous in evil deeds. A recent poll of Americans who regularly attend church estimated that only three percent believe that they are the ones who might go to hell.1 And they perceive evil as an active, creative, and even autonomous force at work in the world. This last response suggests that perhaps the popular imagination knows something that ethical theorists do not. Ethicists who study busi nesses and organizations typically attribute malevolence and cruelty on the part of businesspeople to either a failure of moral reasoning or to a complete lack of empathie imagination. Some ethical lapses do appear to be the result of individuals' failure to think; they operate on a kind of moral autopilot, following a script they have never thought to question. The pilots who, during the 1950s, routinely dumped fuel into the ocean prior to landing did not set out to harm the environment. They were simply following the landing procedures they had been taught by those pilots who were their teachers. If evil is identical with mindlessness, then the best way to combat it is to instill habits of mindfulness. Those of us who teach ethics try to do so by asking our students to consider cases with a view to determining where and why people went wrong. We look for revealing patterns and causes. We",

In a fight, the opponent is just a noxious stimulus. The actions of the combatants are dominated by an urge to destroy or to drive away this noxious stimulus. The~aggressive acts of each of the opponents stimulate aggressive counter acts of the other. This process, then, is mostly self-perpetuating and automatic. Such are the combats one finds in the sub-human world, combats between enemy species, between rivals for a mate, between competitors for food or living space.",

      "title": "Critical Innocence and Straight Reading",
      "abstract": "I USE here not (in the first instance) in the sense of not harming or not intending to harm, but in the sense of not being accountable for the consequences (possibly harmful, although this is no longer essential to the meaning of the term) of not having knowledge one does not happen to have-knowledge that one might have or even be expected or assumed to have. Innocence in this sense is not the same thing as ignorance, but it presupposes ignorance. Of course the two senses are connected, since it was tasting the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge that constituted the traditional first loss of innocence, but that is not a line I wish to follow here, even though it is not without relevance to the issues I shall be discussing. There are some things one can't come to know without losing one's innocence in some respect or other-coming to know which reveals hitherto unrealized possibilities of error, either already committed (as in the evangelical conviction of sin) or encountered for the first time, whether as risk or temptation. Such knowledge may be disquieting, but it may also be liberating, since error does not necessarily ensue, nor is it the only new possibility. In this short article I want to deal with a kind of knowledge of language, which has consequences for the understanding of literature, that I think falls under this description. A useful paradigm case of loss of innocence in the sense I mean, and that I have described elsewhere, is something that happens frequently in the history of individual religious belief. Somebody growing up in a closed community, and learning only one set of beliefs, may die in the faith without ever having felt a challenge to it. But just knowing that an alternative set of beliefs exists and is held, let us say, by infidels may start a chain of thought like this: here are two sets of beliefs that contradict one another; they cannot both be true, so one of them must be false; but if one is false the other may be false also, so there may be no true belief. Language has this in common with religious belief, that the one we start with is characteristically that of the culture we grow up in, and it may be a long time before we grasp the significance of the fact that there are others. It need not ever be grasped: people (English tourists on the Continent used to be one of the stock examples) can observe that foreigners",

We should add very much to our happiness by a timely recognition of the simple truth that every man's chief and real existence is in his own skin, and not in other people's opinions; and, consequently, that the actual conditions of our personal life, health, temperament, capacity, income, wife, children, friends, home, are a hundred times more important for our happiness than what other people are pleased to think of us: otherwise we shall be miserable.(Schopenhauer)",

      "abstract": "Euthanasia, also known as assisted suicide, is the act of intentionally ending the life of a person suffering from a terminal illness or incurable condition. The word \"euthanasia\" comes from the Greek words \"eu,\" meaning \"good,\" and \"thanatos,\" meaning \"death.\"1 Passive euthanasia entails the withholding treatment necessary for the continuance of life. Active euthanasia entails the use of lethal substances or forces (such as administering a lethal injection), and is more controversial. Euthanasia is a highly sensitive issue under scrutiny from medical, ethical, religious, cultural and socio-economic viewpoints.",

      "title": "One tune, three dances : using a traumatic stress framework to understand trauma survivors as networked news sources",
      "abstract": "Newman and Nelson (2012) describe three ‘dances’ to explain the vacillating psychological states of trauma survivors: the dance of approach and avoidance; the dance of fragmentation and integration; and the dance of resilience and vulnerability. The first pair of seemingly opposite responses describes how survivors at times cope by ‘approaching’ the trauma, for example by gathering information about what happened; whilst at other times, the same person will cope by ‘avoiding’ the trauma by engaging in activities which distract them from the memory of the trauma or having to deal with the consequences of it. The ‘dance’ of fragmentation and integration describes the opposing individual or group experiences encountered after traumas or disasters. Individuals may experience fragmentation, or emotional disconnection, from the trauma as an adaptive means of survival. The ‘dance’ of resilience and vulnerability refers to an individual’s ability to ‘process’ trauma and return to a resilient state in which they re-learn to trust people and the world around them and ‘bounce back’ to a state of being resilient again. \r\n\r\nThis paper will illustrate how an understanding of the three dances can be used to enable survivors of child sexual assault to engage with the media to tell their stories. I will give current examples from six months of journalism research, collaboration and writing of a series of news stories and features which broke an exclusive story simultaneously in The Australian and The Times in London during 2013.",

      "title": "Emotional tears: What they are and how they work",
      "abstract": "Tears serve ophthalmic functions: They lubricate, nourish, and protect the cornea. Tearers produce tears non-permanently and at relatively low cost. And observers pay attention to the eyes of others and extract from eyes and faces a lot of information about others’ stable and transient characteristics, including their mental states. These background conditions may have led to the evolution in the human lineage of additional signaling functions in tears. Emotional tearing occurs during negative events (e.g., injuries) and positive events (e.g., achievements). Episodes of tearing appear to be united by tearers’ subjective imputation of negative or positive value to certain internal or external events. Knowing the degree to which things enhance or diminish one’s prospects—the value of things—is a pressing matter for humans and other organisms. Value information is produced for internal consumption, to be used by behavior-regulating mechanisms in the focal individual. But some value information is made available, in addition, to other people, through tearing and other forms of verbal and non-verbal communication. Tearing may function as an implicit plea for receivers to minimize the costs imposed on the tearer by nature, by third-parties, or by the receivers themselves—common when the tearer has lower formidability or wherewithal than receivers do. In addition, tearing may exhort receivers to infer and register which things the tearer values, positively or negatively. Here, we characterize tears, describe the game-theoretic logic of bargaining from a position of weakness, outline the computational systems that regulate the production of and responses to emotional tears, and review findings about emotional tearing that are relevant to the signaling hypothesis.",

      "title": "Pride, Shame, and Group Identification",
      "abstract": "Self-conscious emotions such as shame and pride are emotions that typically focus on the self of the person who feels them. In other words, the intentional object of these emotions is assumed to be the subject that experiences them. Many reasons speak in its favor and yet this account seems to leave a question open: how to cash out those cases in which one genuinely feels ashamed or proud of what someone else does? This paper contends that such cases do not necessarily challenge the idea that shame and pride are about the emoting subject. Rather, we claim that some of the most paradigmatic scenarios of shame and pride induced by others can be accommodated by taking seriously the consideration that, in such cases, the subject “group-identifies” with the other. This is the idea that, in feeling these forms of shame or pride, the subject is conceiving of herself as a member of the same group as the subject acting shamefully or in an admirable way. In other words, these peculiar emotive responses are elicited in the subject insofar as, and to the extent that, she is (or sees herself as being) a member of a group – the group to which those who act shamefully or admirably also belong. By looking into the way in which the notion of group identification can allow for an account of hetero-induced shame and pride, this paper attempts to achieve a sort of mutual enlightenment that brings to light not only an important and generally neglected form of self-conscious emotions, but also relevant features of group identification. In particular, it generates evidence for the idea that group identification is a psychological process that the subject does not have to carry out intentionally in the sense that it is not necessarily triggered by the subject’s conative states like desires or intentions.",

Terjemahnya: Dan dari segala sesuatu Kami ciptakan berpasangpasangan supaya kamu mengingat kebesaran Allah (49). Jadi, segala sesuatu yang diciptakan oleh Allah swt di muka bumi ini masing-masing memiliki pasangan. Misalnya: laki-laki dan perempuan, jantan dan betina, siang dan malam, atas dan bawah, baik dan buruk, yang sesuai dengan keinginan dan yang tidak sesuai dengan keinginan. Dalam kehidupan di dunia ini, setiap manusia tidak akan kosong dari dua hal, yaitu: 1) Yang sesuai dengan keinginannya. 2) Yang tidak sesuai dengan keinginannya. Hal-hal yang sesuai dengan keinginan manusia, seperti: sehat, selamat, banyak harta, banyak keluarga, banyak sahabat dan semua kelezatan dunia lainnya. Adapun hal-hal yang tidak sesuai dengan keinginan manusia, seperti: ketaatan, kemaksiatan dan musibah.1 1JamEl al-DFn al-QEsimG, Tahb Mau`izat al-Mu’minn (Cet.

Demikian juga manusia memiliki pilihan untuk menolak kemaksiatan atau melakukan kemaksiatan. Akan tetapi, musibah tidak demikian halnya, musibah tidak terikat dengan ikhtiar manusia.3 Artinya manusia tidak memiliki pilihan untuk menolak musibah, manusia hanya memiliki pilihan untuk menghindari atau menghindarkan musibah. Persoalan musibah tidak saja dibahas oleh al-Qur’an, tetapi juga dibahas oleh Hadis Rasulullah saw. Namun dalam tulisan ini, akan dibahas tentang musibah berdasarkan Hadis Rasulullah saw. Dan sudah barang tentu persoalan musibah telah diuraikan oleh banyak Hadis dengan matan dan sanad yang mungkin berbeda dalam berbagai kitab Hadis. Perbedaan matan dan sanad Hadis yang berbicara tentang suatu pokok persoalan, tidak terlepas dari periwayatan Hadis secara lisan dalam kurun waktu yang relatif lama. Lebih satu abad sepeninggal Rasulullah saw, barulah Hadis itu dibukukan, yaitu pada masa pemerintahan Umar bin Abdil Aziz (w. 101 H).4 Akan tetapi, perbedaan matan Hadis yang berbicara tentang suatu pokok persoalan bisa menjadi penyebab perbedaan kualitas Hadis.

The current study examines everyday beliefs about authentic objects, with three primary goals: to determine the scope of adults' evaluation of authentic objects, to examine such evaluation in two distinct cultural settings, and to determine whether a person's attachment history (i.e., whether or not they owned an attachment object as a child) predicts evaluation of authentic objects. We found that college students in the UK (N=125) and the USA (N=119) consistently evaluate a broad range of authentic items as more valuable than matched control (inauthentic) objects, more desirable to keep, and more desirable to touch, though only non-personal authentic items were judged to be more appropriate for display in a museum. These patterns were remarkably similar across the two cultural contexts. Additionally, those who had an attachment object as a child evaluated objects more favorably, and in particular judged authentic objects to be more valuable. Altogether, these results demonstrate broad endorsement of \"positive contagion\" among college-educated adults.",

Besides, other people's life is appraised according to different criteria: Some circumstances suggest that disposing of others' life--i.e. eliminating it good and proper--is advisable.

      "title": "The representation of self through the dialogic properties of talk and conduct",
      "abstract": "It is a basic dialogical principle that the meaning of what is said or done is based on its similarities and especially its differences with other things that might have been said or done as relevantly instead, just then, just there. This makes what was actually said or done meaningful as a “choice” for all practical purposes, whether the actor made it consciously or not. And any choice a person makes (or is deemed to make) is revealing about what he or she had in mind — his or her intentions and wants, values and affects, character and qualities as a social being — that subjectively warranted producing what was said or done instead of one of the alternatives. What one’s talk and conduct reveal about what one had in mind constitutes a representation of one’s self as a social being. This representation is a persona, a “face” in Goffman’s sense. This representation is discursively, dialogically produced, such that actors’ talk and conduct will unavoidably produce a representation of themselves regardless of whether they intend it. Accordingly, persons who would not be expected to have such competence nonetheless produce representations of self, for example young children or impaired adults. Insofar as those representations are in the person’s self-interest, there is a warrant for considering that they have that competence after all. In contrast, persons who can be expected to have such competence may nonetheless produce representations that work against their self-interest by accident or deficiencies of performance. Arguably, it is an additional dimension of the representation of self that an actor produces, having to do with his or her competence, whether the representation seems to be intentional, and beyond that, artful or clever. I examine two cases to elaborate on the key propositions here: (a) that representations of self are produced whether intended or not, (b) that ones that seem to be intended because they are in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of his or her competence, and (c) that ones that seem unintentional because they are not in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of a performance lapse, or more broadly, deficiencies of competence. The first case is of two young children whose talk and conduct interactively produce representations of self that do serve their respective interests, and thus warrant reconsideration of the expressive and interactional competence of children of that age. The second is of a doctor in an urban clinic whose representation of self is not in his self-interest.",

Participants indicated their emotional reaction to and immorality judgment of a story protagonist killing him- or herself. Sadness, not disgust, was the modal emotional reaction. Intention mattered: Intentionally killing oneself and killing oneself for revenge was judged more immoral than accidentally killing oneself and killing oneself for altruistic intention.

      "abstract": "Embodiment approaches to cognition and emotion have put forth the idea that the way we think and talk about affective events often recruits spatial information that stems, to some extent, from our bodily experiences. For example, metaphorical expressions such as \"being someone's right hand\" or \"leaving something bad behind\" convey affectivity associated with the lateral and sagittal dimensions of space. Action tendencies associated with affect such as the directional fluency of hand movements (dominant right hand-side - positive; non-dominant left hand-side - negative) and approach-avoidance behaviors (forward - positive; backwards - negative) might be mechanisms supporting such associations. Against this background, experimental research has investigated whether positive and negative words are freely allocated into space (e.g., close or far from one's body) or resonate with congruent (vs. incongruent) predefined manual actions usually performed by joysticks or button presses (e.g., positive - right; negative - left, or vice versa). However, to date, it is unclear how the processing of affective concepts resonate with directional actions of the whole body, the more if such actions are performed freely within a context enabling both, lateral and sagittal movements. Accordingly, 67 right-handed participants were to freely step on an 8-response pad (front, back, right, left, front-right, front-left, back-right, or back-left) after being presented in front of them valence-laden personal life-events submitted before the task (e.g., words or sentences such as \"graduation\" or \"birth of a child\"). The most revealing finding of this study indicates that approach-avoidance behaviors and space-valence associations across laterality are interwoven during whole body step actions: Positive events induced steps highly biased to front-right whereas negative events induced steps highly biased to back-left.",

The art of offerings is the art of symbols in which concrete and abstract could create artistic as well as symbols of supernatural characters; ten characters, five characters which are applicable and have different functions. And sometimes contradictory according to the needs and intended use. From these observations arose the interpretation of a meaning that, in meeting the needs of human life, basically has two major potential attractions to each other and complementary, i.e. doing structuring/restructuring or order which is oriented on the arrangement of a better life.

The concept of the balance contained in the upakara or offering means in comparison to the meaning of life phenomena that occur in society today seems to have been neglected and even abandoned. This can be proven where there has been deviation measures both the nature and the human life, among others, the exploitation of natural resources, discrimination in law and human rights, gender, and abuse of authority in the field of public administration, and will impact the spread of ecological crisis and moral degradation, as well as heighten the level of community poverty.

This difference is sometimes captured by appealing to shared or joint intentions that allow individuals to coordinate what they do over space and time. In what follows we will use the terminology of we-intentionality to refer to what individuals do when they engage in group ways of thinking, feeling and acting. Our aim in this paper is to argue that we-intentionality is best understood in relation to a shared living environment in which acting individuals are situated. By the “living environment” we mean to refer to places and everyday situations in which humans act. These places and situations are simultaneously social, cultural, material and natural. We will use the term “affordance” to refer to the possibilities for action the living environment furnishes. Affordances form and are maintained over time through the activities people repeatedly engage in the living environment. We will show how we-intentionality is best understood in relation to the affordances of the living environmentand by taking into account the skills people have to engage with these affordances. For this reason we coin the term ‘skilled we-intentionality’ to characterize the intentionality characteristic of group ways of acting, feeling and thinking.</ns4:p>",

      "abstract": "I would like to add to Julio Arboleda- Florez's excellent discussion of the problem of psychiatric participation in interrogations. There is considerable international support for asking psychiatrists and other physicians not only to decline to participate in torture and related practices, but also to speak out vigorously against its use by governments.\r\n\r\nWhile medical ethics surely disapproves such practices, they are also widely condemned in other quarters. For example, in its aspirational of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, the United Nations General Assembly, after asserting that no person under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, adds in a note: The term 'cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses, whether physical or mental, including the holding of a detained or imprisoned person in conditions which deprive him, temporarily or permanently, of the use of any of his natural senses, such as sight or hearing, or of his awareness of place and the passing of time (1).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Body of Principles requires that no detained person while being interrogated shall be subject to violence, threats or methods of interrogation which impair his capacity of decision or his judgement (1).\r\n\r\nPsychiatrists are in a unique position to understand and communicate the importance of these principles and should denounce torture strongly in every possible venue. As Sagan and Jonsen (2) observed, because the medical skills used for healing can be maliciously perverted with devastating effects on the spirit and the body, it is incumbent upon the medical profession and upon all of its practitioners to protest in effective ways against torture as an instrument of political control. This is even more urgently true today than when it was written thirty years ago.",

Just as both seed and soil are necessary for plant growth (you won’ t get much plant unless you have both of these), so when we look at depression we need to look at both the seeds – the stresses or triggering events – and the nature of the child at the time these events occur. It would be meaningless to say that one or the other is the cause: both are necessary.",

      "title": "What Is General Semantics?: A Personal View.",
      "abstract": "Sometimes when people ask What General Semantics?, don't want to answer. My reluctance to categorize general semantics arises from the general semantics principle of non-identity. This postulates that no two things are identical in all respects. Suppose say, a Such a sentence uses a form of is called the is-of-identity. It violates the non-identity principle. In effect, I've said, individual noun (Pat) equals class noun (politician), X identical to Y, identical to This seems harmless, you say. Not so! Tunnel Vision I've confused the specific with the general, confused things with words, and imposed linguistic limitations that do not reflect the rich diversity of a living human who has personality, hopes, habits, a certain physique, etc. I've reduced Pat to a label, politician. My self-imposed tunnel vision will prejudge and damage my relationship with Pat. By treating this individual as identical to a class, category, or group, can't help but think and act as if all politicians are alike. If a particular politician has disappointed me, will probably react badly to all. Labels That Limit Suppose we have a task to do, and we only have a We can say, I can't do it, only have a screwdriver. In practice, we can use a screwdriver to drive screws, to hammer, chisel, lever, wedge, garden, open cans, crack ice, stir liquids, etc. Similarly, we can use the numerous tools of general semantics to achieve diverse goals. Hence my reluctance to limit general semantics with is-of-identity labeling. Yet to describe, we must focus, select, abstract. Incidentally, a key formulation of the system of general semantics says that we process information at biological and verbal levels by abstracting, by leaving things out. We've chosen not to describe the system by means of the is-of-identity, by what it is. We can describe something by what it does. Success and Survival think of general semantics as a system for making evaluations vital to success and survival. By evaluating, mean our processing of perceptions and inferences as influenced by existing conscious and unconscious assumptions. Evaluations, not necessarily conscious ones, involve our thoughts, feelings, judgments, decisions, etc. Generally we do something as a result. Evaluating leads to appropriate or inappropriate action. We might describe general semantics as an integrated system for improving our thinking, evaluating, communicating, etc. Of course, in doing so we've only just begun. Alfred Korzybski formulated general semantics in the first half of this century in his major work, Science and Sanity, and he continued to write and lecture about general semantics until his death in 1950. Numerous educators, writers, and editors have continued to develop and disseminate his work, including Irving J. Lee, Wendell Johnson, Harry Weinberg, Francis Chisholm, Kenneth Johnson, S. I. Hayakawa, Elwood Murray, Russell Joyner, Robert Pula, Anatol Rapoport, Mary Morain, D. David Bourland, Jr., Susan Presby Kodish, Bruce I. Kodish, Earl Hautala, Jeremy Klein, and Gregory Sawin. Beyond Aristotle Korzybski called general semantics a non-Aristotelian system because its many-valued logic goes beyond the two-valued, either-or logic attributed to Aristotle. Two-valued Aristotelian logic says either X Y, or X not Y; it offers no middle choices, and it often leads to either-or evaluating. Non-Aristotelian logic employs multiple values, a range of choices, more in keeping with the diversity of lived experience. It adheres to the principle of non-identity by allowing degrees of difference or similarity. Separation of Word and Thing Korzybski recognized that language and lived experience consist of two distinctly separate realms. He said The word not the thing, and Whatever you might say the object 'is,' well, it not. …",

      "abstract": "What is meant by “method” in the sciences? The English word derives from the ancient Greek methodos, which has its roots in the idea of being crafty or cunning. Later for the Greeks it came to mean “the pursuit of knowledge” or “a way of enquiry” (literally “way of pursuit”). For us moderns it has a wider usage. The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that a method is a way of doing something in accordance with a plan, or a special procedure; or it is a regular systematic way of either treating a person or attaining a goal. It is also a systematic or orderly arrangement of topics, discourses or ideas. In general one can speak of a method for gutting and filleting fish, baking a cake, wiring a fuse box, surveying a given piece of landscape, conducting a funeral or cracking a safe. Not following the prescribed method usually leads to a botched, or socially unacceptable, outcome. There are also methods for teaching languages, for example, the immersion method; there are methods for teaching the violin to the very young, for example, the Suzuki method; there are methods for learning and playing curling, or a nose flute; and so on. In general there are methods whereby one can not only best teach or learn a given subject, but also present an effective case in a law court, write up a report, conduct an orchestra or a meeting, and so on.",

      "title": "Bonded actions",
      "abstract": "Although all social action is directed at other people, many social actions are initiated by someone who did not perform the action. This form of social action is called bonded action - any action that is not a direct expression of the acting individual's will or decision - anything that someone asks, coerces, or forces another person to say or do. Bonded actions are characterized by the social bonds that hold a relationship together, but the action itself can also be directed at people outside the relationship. That actions are bonded means not only that they are initiated by or together with others within the same relationship; it often means that people are provided with resources to help them perform these actions. People who act on behalf of organizations are transformed into organizational centaurs. Not unlike the mythical centaurs, their individual human features are insufficient to restrain the collective power of which they are a part. Most people are affiliated with several relationships, and they perform different types of bonded actions. In this way, the individual's ability to act is divided, and each piece uses only part of the person's repertoire of actions. Both actions and emotions are divided and exercised as people move from relationship to relationship. The remainder of the chapter is an exploration of the interfaces between bonds and between individuals and their bonds. Some form of casting occurs in most social bonds as a method of creating correspondence between individuals and bonds. The concepts of greedy relationships and emotional labour are also discussed, as is the interface between bonds in such situations as multiple citizenship, whistleblowing, corruption, and match fixing.",

According to agency accounts of this pride relation, the self and the object of pride are suitably related just in case one is morally responsible for the existence or excellence of the object of one's pride. I argue that agency accounts fail. This argument provides a strong prima facie defence of an alternate account of pride, according to which the self and the object of pride are suitably related just in case one's relation to the object of pride indicates that one's life accords with some of one's personal ideals. I conclude that the pride relation, though distinct from the relation of moral responsibility, is nonetheless a relation of philosophical interest that merits further attention. … the objects which excite these passions [pride and humility], are very numerous, and seemingly very different from each other. Pride or self‐esteem may arise from the qualities of the mind; wit, good‐sense, learning, courage, integrity: from those of the body; beauty, strength, agility, good mien, address in dancing, riding, fencing: from external advantages; country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens, horses, dogs, cloaths. [I] afterwards proceed to find out that common circumstance, in which all these objects agree, and which causes them to operate on the passions. —David Hume",

Anonymity, in this definition, is constituted formally by the absence of a name, or the presence of a false name, in the medium of publication. Friends, family, colleagues, editors, and publishers, naturally, are frequently aware of the identity of an anonymous author (but they are also frequently kept in the dark). The anonymity of a publication, as I define it, is not affected by whether a few people are in on the secret, or whether the identity of the author is in fact an open secret to many. For example, consider a first edition that has been published anonymously while the second edition has been signed; the author is now known, but the first edition continues to be an anonymous publication.",

      "abstract": "Si hay una acción, dentro de un contexto bélico, que muestre la magnitud del odio hacia el Otro enemigo es, sin duda, el tratamiento que se da a los cadáveres. En las escenas bélicas de la Ilíada se observa un deseo poderoso de mutilar el cuerpo del enemigo, ya sea con las propias manos o dejándoselo a los perros o aves de rapiña. En la actualidad, hemos sido testigos en más de una ocasión de cómo las redes sociales han sido el escenario escogido por soldados para mostrar a través de la publicación de vídeos o fotos el tratamiento que se le da al cuerpo del enemigo, ya sea torturándolo o con actos vejatorios. ¿Cómo es posible que el tratamiento hacia el cuerpo del enemigo haya cambiado tan poco en más de 3000 años? La mutilación del cadáver del enemigo puede leerse en términos de la total deshumanización del Otro. Cuando Aquiles arrastra el cuerpo de Héctor deja su cara en el suelo con el fin de desfigurarla, ya que la cara es la parte del cuerpo que nos individualiza. Así, la vida del Otro en la guerra se vuelve una vida digna de ser destruida. Estas vidas son consideradas inferiores y, por eso, no merecedoras de los mismos derechos o privilegios que acompañas al Nosotros. Siguiendo este razonamiento, el Yo se autoproclama como legitimador de llevar a cabo tales actos de violencia, como analizaremos aquí.",

But it is less clear how to ask the same question of a society. The question is muddied further by the fact that societies can change. A leopard can’t change its spots. But a society can become more or less productive in the organization of its economy, more or less equal in its distribution of opportunity, more or less democratic. This course provides an extended answer to the question of of a country the United States is. It also explores the implications of that answer for understanding, and making progress in solving, some of the social problems that confront America today. Our discussion revolves around five key values that most Americans believe our society should realize: \n1. Freedom: the idea, commonly thought to be the most essential to the American creed, that people should be able to live their lives, to the greatest degree possible, as they wish. This means people should be free from coercive restrictions imposed by others and, as much as possible, have the capacity to put their life plans into effect. \n2. Prosperity: the idea that an economy should generate a high standard of living for most people, not just a small privileged elite. \n3. Economic efficiency: the idea that the economy should generate rational outcomes, effectively balancing costs and benefits in the way resources are used.\n4. Fairness: the idea that people should be treated justly and that they should have equal opportunity to make something of their lives without unfair privileges and unfair disadvantages.\n5. Democracy: the idea that our public decisions should reflect the collective will of equal citizens, not of powerful and privileged elites.",

      "title": "Making sense of safety: Figure 1",
      "abstract": "Beyond injury prevention\n\nThe concept of “safety” can have many different meanings. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines it as “freedom from danger and risks”, while the Merriam-Webster Dictionary describes safety as “the condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss”. According to etymologist Douglas Harper, the word safe first came into use in the English language around 1280, derived from the Old French sauf , which in turn stemmed from the Latin salvus , meaning “uninjured, healthy, safe”. The Latin word is related to the concepts of salus (“good health”), saluber (“healthful”), and solidus (“solid”), all derived from the Proto-Indo-European base word solwos , meaning “whole”.1 Thus, at its root, the concept of safety revolves around wholeness and health.\n\nInjury prevention researchers have defined safety as “a state or situation characterised by adequate control of physical, material, or moral threats”, which “contributes to a perception of being sheltered from danger” (Andersson and Svanstrom, as quoted in Welander et al , page 122). Safety is commonly viewed through the lens of specific injury domains: for some researchers in the injury prevention field, safety has come to mean the prevention of crime and violence; for others, a reduction in motor vehicle deaths or a feeling of being out of danger rather than being in a positive state of human growth and development.3\n\nDue to the multitude of views on the definition of safety, a collaborative effort was launched in 1996 by two World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centers on Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention, sponsored by the Ministry of Health, Quebec, Canada, and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, to develop international consensus on the conceptual and operational aspects of safety and safety promotion.2 A document was published in 1998 entitled Safety and Safety Promotion: Conceptual …",

By this effect, it is an important factor of (human) evolution protecting man from harmful impacts, similarly to the role of immunity. However, immunity is also continuously influenced by hormetic effects of environmental [chemical (pollutions), physical (background irradiations and heat), etc.] and medical (drugs and therapeutic irradiations) and food interactions. In contrast to earlier beliefs, the no-threshold irradiation dogma is not valid in low-dose domains and here the hormesis concept is valid. Low-dose therapeutic irradiation, as well as background irradiations (by radon spas or moderately far from the epicenter of atomic bomb or nuclear facilities), is rather beneficial than destructive and the fear from them seems to be unreasonable from immunological point of view. Practically, all immune parameters are beneficially influenced by all forms of low-dose radiations.",

      "title": "BLIND FAITH ACCORDING TO THE JAINAS: THE YAMA CASE",
      "abstract": "According to this pan-Indian1 maxim, there is a connexion between the last thought or thoughts of the dying and their fate in the next life. Hence, it is necessary to help the dying during this essential moment. Ritualising death is the best way to reach this aim. Ritual death is an option only for one who has made up his mind without hurry, if his certain death is near. Suicide determined by emotions, such as excessive arrogance, anger, love or fear,2 is not sanctioned by the rite, because it involves blind attachment and haste. The deceived lover, for instance, who takes the decision to hang himself,3 to throw himself from a rock or to drown himself into a river, shows only that he is a fool (bāla), and dies the death of a fool (bālamaraṇa). In this kind of “deliberate” death or suicide there is no room for ritual, because there is no, or very little, room for reflection and conscience. Yet, when disease or similar circumstances give death the appearance of inevitability, and when this is not only established by the dying, but confirmed by his guru, the choice of dying according to a ritual may seem rational (paṇḍita-maraṇa). This is the case in the Jaina ritual eradication (Skt. saṃlekhanā) of karmic particles at the end of life. In the context of this ritual, death is not awaited passively. Fasting unto death is an activity. By taking his vows again, by progressively reducing food and drink, the future dead plays an active part in his own process of dying. Moreover, his activity involves the religious group to which he belongs. He does not die alone, away from human society, but near his guru, in a place which reminds him of his belonging to a Jaina community. However, despite the fact that the ritual death is backed by the religious group or by some of its mendicant or lay members, the man who is fasting to death is in some way, alone, busy with his own thoughts. Loneliness or solitariness (ekatva) is familiar to the Jainas. They know that social and even family bounds do not ameliorate the helpless situation (aśaraṇa) of anybody dying—the",

Manusia memerlukan pertolongan satu sama lainnya dan persekutuan dalam memperoleh kemajuannya. Disamping itu tiap-tiap individu manusia masing-masing mempunyai kepentingan dari awal sampai akhir hidupnya, bahkan sejak sebelum dilahirkan kedunia sudah mempunyai kepentingan, juga sampai sesudah di kuburkannya, tiap tiap kepentingan antara satu dengan yang lainnya ada yang bersamaan ada juga yang berlainan, bahkan ada yang bertentangan ada juga yang menyebabkan bentrokan. Semua ini memerlukan perlindungan dan peraturan. Setiap individu manusia mempunyai keinginan supaya memperoleh kebutuhannya. Usaha untuk memperoleh kebutuhan masing-masing, timbul saingan yang kadang-kadang bertentangan antara satu kebutuhan dengan lainnya. Timbul perlombaan, persaingan, penyerobotan,penganiayaan, dan pembunuhan. Keadilan dan tata tertib hidup dapat dipelihara dengan semestinya, perlu adanya peraturan dan hukuman yang dapat dilaksanakan dengan sempurna dan seksama. Al-Ghazali menerangkan bahwa berakhlak baik atau berakhlak terpuji itu menghilangkan semua adat-adat kebiasaan yang tercela yang sudah dirincikan oleh agama islam serta menjauhkan diri dari padanya, sebagaimana menjauhkan diri dari tiap najis dan kotoran, kemudian membiasakan adat kebiasaan yang baik, menggemarinya, melakukannya dan mencintainya.

      "title": "\"Lawful as Eating\": Art, Life, and Magic in the Winter's Tale",
      "abstract": "Leontes's speech in the middle of the statue scene in The Winter's Tale makes a puzzling analogy, put in the form of a conditional proposition. If this be he says as the statue comes to life, it be an art as eating. (1) But why as eating?, one may ask. What is it about in this context, that makes it a fit term for the comparison Leontes is making, and a completion of Leontes's thought? Is there is a kind of lawfulness to different from or akin to other kinds of lawfulness, to which of some sort might aspire? What is the meaning and value of here? One way to proceed toward an answer and get inside the thought Leontes expresses would be to consider eating as a material practice. The idea then would be to think of magic as a material practice too: let the one practice be as as another. But the two practices are not structurally equivalent. With respect to the persons involved in their respective actions, the magic Leontes is thinking about is a productive or art; (2) if it is ever practiced as an art at all, is intransitive, or at most self-reflexive; it is an art of consumption. Moreover, the magic in question is a suspect art, only rarely practiced, by only a small number of self-selected practitioners, and often dubious from a religious or moral standpoint; whereas eating is universal, whether artfully undertaken, by the wise, or unartfully by everyone else, and it is seldom in that sense dubious. In Food in Shakespeare, Joan Fitzpatrick argues that lawful in this passage means normal, as when a physical aspect of a body is rather than abnormal, and benign rather than malignant. (3) And so normality is what is in question when magic and eating are compared. Whether transitive or intransitive, the two practices may be comparable in terms of their normality. Let something abnormal (like magic) be something normal (like eating). But Fitzpatrick also argues that essential to the psychology of The Winter's Tale, even a key to Leontes's notoriously causeless jealousy, are unsound eating practices, so that in fact abnormal eating is what Leontes's proposition is occupied with. The idea sounds funny, but this is a funny play: what Leontes would have needed to do is either to avoid being overcome with irrational jealousy or be cured of the melancholy he fell into after the apparent death of his wife and daughter was to have dieted himself better. If this be magic, let it be an art as eating, indicates a shared normality from which Leontes's life has up to now pathologically strayed, and from which it shall no longer stray. Let this act of magic, the resurrection of Hermione, be a material practice as normal from now on as the material practice of eating well from now on--even if, again, magic is a transitive art, eating an intransitive art, if it is an art at all, and a main problem of this play has been not that eating is a normal thing to do but that eating can be undertaken abnormally or unjustly, under suspect conditions. Enter Antigonous, pursued (and eaten) by a bear. As Fitzpatrick shows, the theme of eating as a norm easily violated or rendered grotesque is woven into the pattern of themes in this play about violated norms. But to interpret Leontes's wishful injunction, If this be magic ... as a statement of potential equivalence, and even as a registration of the idea that eating was once unlawful or abnormal in Sicilia, and for that reason a direct cause of the ills that have beset the kingdom, is problematic. It misses the sense of surprise and wonder that Leontes is expressing, and the polysemy of the language Leontes uses to express it. (4) It even misses, I think, the special point about the nature of eating that Leontes is making. If this be magic, let it be an art as eating. The sentence is technically a subjunctive conditional, with the additional complication that its main clause is either wishful or hortatory, bordering on what in some languages would be called the optative, yet also taking the form of what grammarians categorize as an imperative. …",

For some people, death becomes so familiar that fear becomes daring, in some sense, they are ready to lose everything, or at least, no longer expects anything, as heroes did on the battlefield. Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad IV.3.36 has mentioned that: when this body starts to frail, whether it frails through old age or disease, just as a mango or a fig or a fruit of the Peplum tree releases itself from its bond (gets detached from its stalk), even so this person frees himself from these limbs and returns again as he came to the place from which he started back to a new life. Data was collected using desk study and analyzed using Hindu studies. The finding of this research that man as a descendant of &lt;em&gt;Raja Bunu&lt;/em&gt; who inhabits this world will someday return to &lt;em&gt;Ranying Hatalla&lt;/em&gt; through death. Life is temporary, as an exodus that someday will return to where we came from. Just as policemen, magistrates, chariot-drivers, leaders of the village gathered round for king’s departure, or as breaths gather round at the end, when a person starts breathing difficultly or when he is about to die, that is when death is a way of ‘freedom‘ to the eternity.&lt;/p&gt;",

This is to say that after creating a single entity the creator destroys the mould. No two things are of the same nature with another, even those in the same family or of the same species. Coming to the human family, the same uniqueness is applicable. No two human beings are the same, even between identical twins there are still always that marks of identification. This shows that every human being is meant to act himself, for he has no replica. Every human person has a unique content and container, meaning that any form of competition and comparison in one's life is stifles creativity and innovation. Hence, this work is out to liberate humanity from the aged long monster of squeezing individuals into a single mould. It will do a critical analysis and exposition on the power of uniqueness via creativity and innovation in politics, economy, education and religion. Hence, the clarion call “Give me chance to act myself, do not squeeze me in the same mould, I have no replica!”.",

      "title": "Bioevolutionary Ethics: A New Paradigm for Public Policy Making",
      "abstract": "The thesis I propose here is simple. Morality and ethics should serve as the basis for public policy; and biological processes lead to the formation of what E. O. Wilson calls our sensibilities. In other words, our notion of right and wrong naturally proceed from our biological evolution. Anything with which a consequence is associated also has an ethical component. This is most easily seen in three superordinate reference points that guide human behavior: (1) concern for individual survival; (2) concern for the survival of the entire culture: and (3) abstract or transcendent concerns that enhance the quality of life. We now understand that our individual survival, the survival of the culture as a whole, and our transcendent concerns are all inextricably bound to the survival of our planet from which we evolved or, more completely, the universe from which we evolved. These reference points that guide human behavior have associated with them a set of rules, moral principles and rights and wrongs that modify human behavior to insure that these reference points are sustained. Most of the time when we speak of ethics or morals it is understood by most to be in a religious context or in the context of some personal and subjective value system. The point of my brief introduction to bioevolutionary ethics is to establish that there is another alternative, one that is objective and rooted in an understanding of our bioevolution. This notion is not new. There are whole schools of thought and philosophy on the subject of ethics based in biology, particularly biological feedback loops. I hasten to add here that the assertion that ethics have evolved from our biological evolution has come and gone over the years and has been refuted by philosophical arguments rooted in David Hume's is/ought dichotomy (1) and G.E. Moore's naturalistic fallacy. (2) There has, in the past, been an inability on the part of evolutionary biologists to show the link between actions that promote survival and moral behavior. Since this is only a brief comment, I will not take the time to present counter arguments to these problems but will simply say that they are problems of language and the logical construct and no longer are valid. Returning now to biological evolution, an often--cited example to make this point is that there is a moral or religious reason to abstain from alcohol. However, the alternative view is that society has observed the negative consequences that overindulgence in alcohol brings, and it has developed a set of rules to govern its consumption. Is it immoral to drink and drive, or deleterious to society as a whole and therefore wrong? Or are they one and the same? The basis for the biological approach to right and wrong is rooted in feedback information given to all biological organisms to enhance survivability through modification of behavior. The human brain is the most efficient processor of information known, and it is, of course, biological. Most people are aware that our planet was threatened by our use of fluorocarbons. We were given the feedback that, if the use of these chemicals continued, our survival would be in jeopardy. Thus, we modified our behavior accordingly. The following story helps illustrate the point about moral intolerance versus biologically-based right and wrong. I lived with the Mennonites in Belize for a time and lived amongst a very strict sect that believed the use of modernisms, as they called them, was forbidden. They firmly held that the use of the internal combustion engine, chemicals, and such would eventually lead to the destruction of human kind and were therefore evil. Biologically-based ethics, on the other hand, would say that these Mennonites had enough cumulative experience to know that the nature of man was such that he would extract as much immediate advantage and gratification as possible from these new technological tools. Lacking wisdom, he would use the tools, blind of any negative consequences, and this would finally lead to his destruction. …",

      "title": "In Re Eichmann: A Dilemma of Law and Morality",
      "abstract": "Ours is an age of paradox. In science we are daily reaching ever greater achievements, overcoming time and space “and now nothing will be restrained from [us], which [we] have imagined to do.” We are literally reaching “unto Heaven.” These achievements in science are in large measure due to our ability to free ourselves of attachment to concrete “thinghood” and to advance toward ever greater abstraction. By contrast, in the humanities, in ethics, and in law, we are still deeply ingrained in a world of “things,” of the concrete and tangible, although a tendency toward abandonment of this orientation is increasingly noticeable. Personality values not tied to external, visible and tangible objects are emerging very slowly. In international law this process lags behind that observable in national legislation. Thus, for example, while spying on another state in the course of an authorized stay therein is widely practiced, there is deep resentment when the wrong consists in a wrongful “touching” of the territory of another state, for this violates “sovereignty” in an “immediate” rather than “consequential” manner, “sovereignty” being apparently conceived of as a physical entity rather than as the realm of a people’s privacy. This is reminiscent of early legal notions, such as the view that an action of trespass will lie only when there has been some direct physical contact, however slight, of the defendant with the body or property of the plaintiff, a view clearly rooted in belief in the magic of touching. A similarly “thinghood-bound” conception of international law is reflected in the recent United Nations Security Council resolution censuring Israel for the capture of Eichmann.",

      "title": "Physicalism",
      "abstract": "Physicalism is a view about the relationship between people’s mental properties and their physical properties. It claims that people’s mental properties are nothing over and above – nothing additional to – their physical properties. People’s mental properties would certainly be nothing over and above their physical properties if their mental properties turned out to form a proper subset of their physical properties, so that every mental property turned out to be identical with – to be literally one and the same thing as – some physical property (e.g. the physical property of having one’s brain be in such and such neurophysiological state). People’s mental properties might also be nothing over and above their physical properties if mental properties turned out to be identical with functional properties that were physically realised. A functional property is the property of having some or other physical property that plays a particular functional role (e.g. that has certain typical causes and typical effects). For example, suppose the mental property of being in pain turns out to be the property of being in some or other internal state that is typically caused by bodily damage and that typically causes wincing and groaning. In that case, if the internal state playing that functional role is always in fact some physical state of the brain, even if it is not always the same type of physical brain state, then being in pain is nothing over and above a physical property. The claim that a particular mental property is identical with a particular physical or functional property is not advanced as any kind of a priori claim, e.g. as a conceptual or analytic truth. It must be supported by empirical evidence. For example, it is argued that the identification of mental property M with physical property P would provide the best explanation of an observed correlation between instances of M and instances of P. Physicalism is claimed to be analogous to such a posteriori scientific hypotheses as that genes are segments of DNA or that chemical elements are systems of physical particles. The two features of mental states that are most often argued to present a problem for physicalism are the phenomenal character of sensations (e.g. the introspectible nature of a severe toothache) and the intentionality of beliefs and desires (e.g. the fact that believing that Bhutan is in India is about Bhutan and India). Physicalists have offered physicalism-friendly accounts of both features.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives This review will describe how human exercise performance at the highest level is exquisitely orchestrated by a set of responses by all body systems related to the evolutionary adaptations that have taken place over a long history. The review will also describe how many adaptations or features are co-opted ( exaptations ) for use in different ways and have utility other than for selective advantage. Methods A review of the literature by relevant search engines and reference lists in key published articles using the terms, performance, limitations, regulation, trade-offs as related to exercise, indicates that there are at least three areas which could be considered key in understanding the evolutionary basis of human exercise performance. Results First, there is a basic assumption that exaptations have limitations or capacities which cannot be exceeded which in turn will limit our physical performance. Second, it is thought that some biological systems and tissues have additional capacity which is rarely fully accessed by the organism; referred to as a safety factor . Third, there are biological trade-offs which occur when there is an increase in one trait or characteristic traded for a decrease in another. Conclusions Adaptations have resulted in safety factors for body systems and tissues with trade-offs that are most advantageous for human performance for a specific environment.",

These questions are important because if we do not answer them, we shan't know what exactly loving the world is, or whether the world is worth loving, or whether loving the world makes one better off. In answer to the question, this paper argues that loving the world is good because (1) it elevates the lover´s sense of self-worth, (2) it tends to lead us to protect the world, (3) it tends to lead us to avoid harming the earth and other human beings, (4) it supports relationships that tend to promote peace and cooperation among individuals and groups, (5) it tends to promote the well-being of those who love the world, (6) it promotes knowledge of the earth and humanity, and self-knowledge, (7) it promotes people's acting in accordance with ethical requirements, (8) it tends to lead us to attunement to the earth and our fellow humans. 186 WORDS.",

      "abstract": "Abstract I watch a stranger cringe in pain, and I react to help. The cognitive/behavioral mechanisms are built into the brain. The origins are ancient. Underlying the response are rules for detection, detecting discomfort in another. The bodily sensibility is not on one side and the rules of engagement on the other.1 Fast appraisal of these events generates approach or avoidance. The representations in the brain are rich in information processing and reflect bodily engagement. Bodily representations are inherent in what has been traditionally called the “moral sentiments” (A. Smith, 1759/1976; table 4.1). Darwin (1871/1982) repeatedly referred to the “moral sense.” He asserted, “Any animal whatever, endowed with a well-marked social instinct, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense of conscience, as soon as its intellectual power had become as well or nearly as well developed as in man” (p. 95). The use of such social abilities is not necessarily solely oriented toward doing no harm or helping conspecifics.",

      "title": "When bad people do good things: will moral enhancement make the world a better place?",
      "abstract": "In his thoughtful defence of very modest moral enhancement, David DeGrazia1 makes the following assumption: ‘Behavioural improvement (ie, ‘greater conformity to appropriate moral norms and therefore a higher frequency of right action’) is highly desirable in the interest of making the world a better place and securing better lives for human beings and other sentient beings’. Later in the paper, he gives a list of some psychological characteristics that ‘all reasonable people can agree … represent moral defects’. I think I am a reasonable person, and I agree that most if not all items on the lists do represent moral defects—I certainly would regard them as such in a close family member or friend. But if I were in the business of ‘making the world a better place and securing better lives for human beings and other sentient beings’, I would hesitate to prescribe moral enhancement (or therapy—the distinction does not matter for my purposes) for everyone with these acknowledged defects. A lot of good work, from removing tumours to negotiating treaties, may be best done by people with serious moral defects.\n\nFor a simple consequentialist, a moral defect is just a trait that tends to make the world a worse place. Not being a consequentialist, I think that moral defects should be identified independently of their tendency to produce worse outcomes. For this reason, I think it's necessary to qualify DeGrazia's starting assumption—I think behavioural improvement may sometimes be undesirable if our goal is to make the world a better place. My reasons will be familiar to readers of Bernard Williams.\n\nAs …",

One passage of his account has become famous: When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shewn by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting or avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signiWed, and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires.",

      "title": "Pavlov + Skinner = Premack",
      "abstract": "Behavior is a sequence of actions. Premackian conditioning occurs when one of those actions permits an animal to engage in more biologically potent positive responses—reinforcement—or forces them to engage in less positive (or negative) responses —punishment. Signals of the transition from one class of actions to another focus the instrumental responses in the first class and inform the contingent responses in the second class. The signals may be innate (USs) or learned (sign-learning); excitatory (leading to more positive actions) or inhibitory (leading to less positive actions). The potency of an action has phylogenetic origins, but may be conditioned by proximity to more potent responses, such as consummation of a reinforcer. With practice instrumental responses may take on increased strength, and in some cases become motivationally autonomous—become habits. Stimuli or responses that signal the availability of more positive actions may become incentive motivators that animals will approach. Discriminative stimuli do not have intrinsic value as reinforcers, but only the value derived from the responses that they release. These forces bend an animal’s trajectory through its stimulus-action-time context into a path that leads more directly to positive actions. The association of actions (conditioned responses, operants, and observing responses) with actions of different potency (ultimately unconditioned responses or consummatory behavior) is the primary association in Premackian conditioning. All other types of conditioning may be interpreted as instances of such Premackian conditioning.",

It pursues this argument via a close consideration of Derrida’s thought, and especially his discussion of the concepts of perjury, testimony, and oath in his later work. It shows that, for Derrida, precisely because the other, or some crucial aspect of the other, remains absolutely other (unknown, opaque, a secret), every interaction presupposes an oath to say what one means and believe what the other says. Put differently, and paradoxically, our capacity for deception that compels us to trust or have faith in one another.

The hearing impaired person (or: the person who has a hearing deficiency) shares this deficiency with her surrounding, she also lives this experience deep within herself. Deafness brings together several disciplines, based on the biological, as well as, social and pedagogical approaches (aspects). This deficiency, which is often resented by others and is initially misunderstood, rubs off on the person who is affected and risks of demoralizing and discouraging her. Strengthening of the ego and personality development of the deaf as a whole autonomous person increases her self confidence and helps her build a solid identity. However, the question often asked: what is the identity of a deaf person? Hearing, deaf or bicultural? What is her future? Before getting any recognition from others, the deaf person needs to know herself. This return to oneself requires her to have knowledge of her own abilities, cultural background and an important feeling of security (a place among his people). The motivation for a better future is a prerequisite for a healthy and balanced development, both from the relational and mental domain. Under what conditions does the deaf person live? Is it framed, loved, recognized? Is it informed, directed, monitored? What image does she have of her own body? What factors from an early age are put into play? What image does she have of herself or what image do we reflect on her? Why? The type of equipment offered, cochlear implants or conventional hearing aid, do they play a role? In this study several factors are being explored; they deal with the problems and issues of the deaf person, the experiences of the person as having a hearing deficiency, the nature and severity of the condition that affects the person and also how this person perceives her own image, consequently her identity and her future.",

      "title": "332 What’s causing obesity in pets and what can we do about it?",
      "abstract": "Abstract The majority of dogs (56%) and cats (60%) are now overweight or obese. A novel theory posits that obesity in pets is due to “treats” and excessive meal amounts given by the “pet-parent” to obtain affection from the pet, which enables “‘eating addiction” in the pet and results in pet-parent “co-dependence.” The pet-parent may even become hostage to the treats/food to avoid the ire of the pet. Eating addiction in the pet appears related to stress/conflict, involving the displacement mechanism, which is a bio-behavioral mechanism in the brains of all animals, even fruit flies. It allows the animal to deal with situations that cannot readily be faced or avoided or are thwarting, such as social isolation. Displacement behavior is out-of-context, irrepressible behavior, e.g. an animal in the wild who sleeps or feeds when threatened by a predator. It is thought due to re-channeling of overflow brain energy to another drive (e.g. feeding drive) when two drives, e.g. fight or flight, equally oppose each other. Moving the opposing drives out of equilibrium, by resolving the animal’s stressful life situations, theoretically halts the displacement mechanism and addictive behavior, e.g. overeating/obesity. Similarly, dealing with the pet-parent’s stressful life situations curtails displacement regarding overfeeding the pet. Treatment for each contribution to companion animal obesity will be presented: Pet-parent seeking affection from the pet by giving food treats, which induces and subsequently triggers displacement overeating in the pet -- &amp;gt; Treatment is pet-parent withdrawal/abstinence from treat-giving. Displacement of pet-parent’s stressful life situations by feeding the pet. The received affection induces and subsequently triggers further treat-giving by the pet-parent. -- &amp;gt; Treatment is developing an action plan for each of the pet-parent’s stressful life situations. Begging, annoyance, aggression, and hostage state of the pet. -- &amp;gt; Treatment is “tough love” by the pet-parent.",

      "abstract": "The third stage is the life of ideas and creations that persist in social memory long after their individual creators have passed on. Ideas are created by individual personalities, communicated to others, and then enter human culture. Design for creativity is considered in terms of temporal and spatial factors and the two cerebral hemispheres. The temporal criteria drive the left hemisphere, for example, acoustic parameters related to voice, speech, and music as well as visual temporal patterns related to movements such as leaves in a gentle breeze, twinkling stars, pendiulum of wall clock, flame, or streamlet [1]. Factors related to spatial patterns, such as those generated in painting and sculpture, engage the right hemisphere. For creativity-enhancing design, creative working space (CWS) [2-6], separate areas are devoted to activities that mainly engage left cerebral hemisphere (calculation, writing sentences, reading) or right hemisphere (ex. drawing figures, painting, selection photographs). Such creative activities may keep a body in good health and a mind strong, no matter what the age, even up to the last moment of life hopefully without any mentally weak. Through individual creation i.e., “the most beautiful flower,” each individual develops respect for others. Mutual respect may avoid ill treatment of each other, and on larger social scales, may help avoid wars.",

      "title": "Disabled or Differently-Abled: A Reading on Disability in A Song of ICE and Fire",
      "abstract": "To analyze if the inclusion and exclusion system in our society is fair. A few bodies born with a different design, unlike the majority are brought under the category of the ‘disabled.’ It has been a human tendency from time immemorial to keep such people hidden or shied away. Such individuals are devoid of the daily lifestyle of the ordinary people. This isolation leaves a great impact on the physical and mental growth of the individual resulting in further damages in the personality. Socialization becomes lesser or completely barred. Hence such individuals are born, live and die in seclusion. The human inclination of stereotyping them has always resulted in the denial of their rights. Martin creates a reflection of society with many disabled characters and how they are treated. The central characters like Bran, Tyrion and Jamie and others as Varys, Hodor, Maester Aemon, Shireen, Patch face, Ghost etc. all are with limited biological functions and are treated differently. In the present paper, the researcher makes a study on this attitude of the society and weigh the justification for the same. Ironically, almost all these characters prove to have their own ingenuity in their lives. Some even prove to be abler than their respective counterparts. So, the question is “should they be kept in seclusion?” Can the inclination of the world to isolate them be justified? Does the world belong only to the majority “Normals?” This paper concludes that it is not. The world cannot be complete without them as it possesses a heterogenous population demanding equal inclusion of every category.",

Some even tend to exclude it, either identifying it with personal development, or with (professional) training. The study focuses on another subject, almost overlooked by specialists, self-sufficiency (understood as the general tendency towards complacency of the great majority of people), on the one side, and the ratio between self-sufficiency and self-education, on the other side. Also, the study aims to prove that: a. without self-education we are condemned to self-sufficiency; b. Self-education is the antidote of self-sufficiency, it is what gives us (or by which we regain) our inner life, our spiritual noblesse, the access to the deep issues of humanity, through which we grow from the inside, organically and authentically.",

It claims that there are widespread psychological barriers against harming, since there are data which suggest that a small percentage of people simply do not. Human beings have psychological barriers against various actions, for example: approaching the edges of cliffs, stealing, handling corpses, standing too close during conversation, eating rotten food, handling snakes, or speaking in public. Some-like those concerning conversational distance-may vary with culture, upbringing and individual history. The barrier theory of evil says that evil acts are bad acts that are made possible by people using an innate or learned strategy to overcome barriers to harm. The barrier to harming humans is not restricted to killing. Combat sports like boxing, kick-boxing, muay thai, and mixed martial arts tournaments like K1, Pancrase or UFC.",

      "title": "Postponement Behavior as a Function of Approach and Avoidance Motivation",
      "abstract": "Human behavior frequently involves planning in relation to interpersonal events scheduled to occur in the near future. A person may be required publicly to commit himself to participate in an impending event at some preferred point in time; thus, for example, he may freely elect to postpone his response rather than perform it immediately. One would generally expect postponement behavior to bear predictable relationships to the strength of relevant motives, particularly when these motives are incompatible with each other. This paper tests two deductions drawn from application of Miller's (1944, 1959) conflict model to postponement behavior. Specifically, the stimulus-similarity axis of the conflict model is identified with the future time dimension, along which some conflict-evoking event may be located. The hypotheses concern S's tendency to postpone his voluntary participation in the event, as a function of the strength of conflicting motives. In order to derive specific testable hypotheses consider first that S commits himself, in the immediate present, to take part in an event which is to occur at some point in futur'e time, and that he may either participate immediately or postpone his participation to some specified degree. Consider also that chis event will be both rewarding and punishing to respective degrees explicitly stated beforehand by E. If it is assumed that a temporal gradient of reward exists, then, the more imminent the event, the stronger will be the acquired approach to it al the instant of commitment. If it is similarly assumed that a temporal gradient of punishment exists, rhen, the more imminent the",

      "abstract": "Humans are immersed in an ocean of words — we understand them, think with them, repeat them, play with their sounds and meanings, and create novel combinations that are understandable to other humans adrift in our part of the ocean. The skill with which a human uses words in speaking has long been a key element in the perception of his or her intelligence. We have a marked tendency to treat people who are articulate as more intelligent than those who are speak poorly. For example, I am startled when a well-spoken ‘customer service representative’ on the telephone is unable to spell psychology or to retain a seven-digit phone number. I am surprised in the opposite direction when someone who speaks English poorly, or with a large proportion of uninterpretable slang, suddenly conveys a subtle and discerning point or quickly fixes a complex problem with my computer software. This language test also has traditionally been used to separate the intellectual ability of humans from that of other animals. Put simply, if other animals can’t understand and generate words or signs in sentencelike combinations, we judge them as less intelligent than humans. The language-based divide that we have constructed between humans and other animals is well defended. During the last 30 years, work suggesting language-related communication in species ranging from chimpanzees to sea lions has attracted a firestorm of criticism that questioned its accuracy, efficacy, and importance. Objections have included claims of outright fraud, inadvertent cuing, and dismissal of results as ‘mere trial-and-error learning’. Perhaps the most common academic complaint is that the language-like productions of nonhumans lack the grammatical constraints and generativity characteristic of human language. Why are humans, certainly academic humans, so intent on distinguishing human language reception and production from the abilities of nonhuman animals? One possibility is that language is the key to a number",

      "abstract": "Book synopsis: The conditional, if...then, is probably the most important term in natural language and forms the core of systems of logic and mental representation. It occurs in all human languages and allows people to express their knowledge of the causal or law-like structure of the world and of others' behaviour, e.g., if you turn the key the car starts, if John walks the dog he stops for a pint of beer; to make promises, e.g., if you cook tonight, I'll wash up all week; to regulate behaviour, e.g., if you are drinking beer, you must be over 18 years of age; to suggest what would have happened had things been different, e.g., if the match had been dry it would have lit, among many other possible uses. The way in which the conditional is modelled also determines the core of most logical systems. Unsurprisingly, it is also the most researched expression in the psychology of human reasoning.\r\n\r\nCognition and Conditionals is the first volume for over 20 years (On Conditionals, 1986, CUP) that brings together recent developments in the cognitive science and psychology of conditional reasoning. Over the last 10 to 15 years, research on conditionals has come to dominate the psychology of reasoning providing a rich seam of results that have created new theoretical possibilities. This book shows how these developments have led researchers to view people's conditional reasoning behaviour more as succesful probabilistic reasoning rather than as errorful logical reasoning. It shows how the multifarious, and apparently competing, theoretical positions developed over the last 50 years in this area - mental logics, mental models, heuristic approaches, dual process theory, and probabilistic approaches-have responded to these insights. Its organisation reflects the view that an integrative approach is emerging that may need to exploit aspects of all these theoretical positions to explain the rich and complex phenomenon of reasoning with conditionals. It includes an introductory chapter relating the development of the psychology of reasoning to developments in the logic and semantics of the conditional. It also includes chapters by many of the leading figures in this field",

      "abstract": "Dignity highlights value, honesty, moral merits, the degree of appreciation as well as a person’s rank in society. In Christian teaching, human dignity is regarded as a divine gift that whatever the circumstances in which the person lives, takes God’s given Model as an example of life and attitude. Term form of dignity in a society can also be understood as the autonomy and freedom of thought as well as the behavior of an individual. Human dignity is very much linked to the sense of honor because a worthy man always inspires respect both to himself and to those around him, to his values and the values of others.1 Thus, the term dignity means the quality to be worthy, prestige, moral authority, dignified attitude, greatness and self–esteem. When talking about the esteem granted to a person we must understand the respect and consideration for human worth and dignity of each person in itself. Dignity cannot be represented without honesty, responsibility, fairness, courage, duty, honesty, etc., values which it integrates. The disregard of the human being, regardless of the reasons from which it springs, brings damages to human dignity, and as such must be regarded as inhuman and reprehensible acts. Human dignity requires the credit or trust that should be given to each person.  KEY WORDS: worth, dignity, human condition, humanistic conceptions, virtue, honesty, respect, responsibility, moral authority.",

With language we can\ncommunicate our experience, our thoughts, and even our aspirations to others.\nLanguage, however, is not only for communication. Words allow us to classify\nobjects in the world. By the use of language we make sense of our experiences\nin a very structured and elaborate way. We can ‘class’ objects together and we\ncan make subtle distinctions between them. We can predict certain qualities that\nmay be found in an object by comparing our own experience with the internal\nlist of objects that fits the same class as the object being observed. For example,\na child’s first confrontation with a puppy may result in a variety of experiences.\nIf the puppy is friendly and quiet and allows the child to play or cuddle it, the\nchild’s first experience will, in the main, be a pleasurable one. If, on the other\nhand, the puppy barks or growls or even bites the child, the outcome will be\nquite different. Whatever the outcome the child will probably add to his or her\ngrowing vocabulary either the word ‘dog’ or ‘puppy’ (or perhaps ‘Rover’,\n‘Shep’, ‘Snapper’ etc.). On the second occasion that this child comes into\ncontact with a dog, the child will most probably remember the first experience.\nIt is likely that the child will utter the appropriate label, ‘dog’ or ‘Rover’\nalthough the experience may well be of a different dog altogether. What is\nimportant is that the child has started to classify his or her experience and by so\ndoing can start to predict the potential outcome of the encounter and to act\naccordingly, either by attempting to play or by moving away in fright. The word\n‘dog’ helps to classify differences; for example, ‘cats’ are often like puppies in\nappearance but do not fit the same class.",

      "abstract": "The terrors of flying are as old as the dreams of it. The first flight of man, reported in Greek mythology, ended with the crashing down of Icarus. Today, planes have become indispensable. Air transport companies boast the fact that travel by air is the safest, despite the fact that fear is ever present. There is little knowledge about fears and passenger behavior. Accident statistics turn terrifying events into “cases”. Tribute is paid to “technical progress” and to “more quality of life.” Measures must be taken to reduce the reasons for apprehension to achieve some kind of rationally based safety to relate to behavior. One should, however, not aim to abolish fear to an irrational and unrealistic degree. Such induced behavior cannot be firm in a real crisis. Fears are founded upon social and personal reasons: (1) Predominantly sociological aspects: the fact of airplane disasters; obscurity of the causes and effects of such disasters; inadequate knowledge of technical facts; doubts about disaster prevention; and “technology trauma.” (2) Predominantly socio-psychological aspects: alien surroundings; isolation; don't know what to do; inescapability; and “Mogadishou-effect.” Anthropological and socio-cultural factors also have an impact. Fear of flying of pilot and crew: Their reasons for fear are related to the exact knowledge of dangers and risks, which are involved in economic and job efficiency oriented requirements and obligations. We recommend: improving information and explanation of risks and the related behavioral safety; improving technical means and management of disaster prevention along with appropriate mediation; courses to decrease fears of flying, including safety training; and decreasing potential conflict with airline personnel.",

      "title": "The Nonperformativity of Antiracism",
      "abstract": "In this paper, I reflect on institutional speech acts: those that make claims \"about\" or \"on behalf' of an institution. Such speech acts involve acts of naming: the institution is named, and in being \"given\" a name, the institution is also \"given\" attributes, qualities, and even a character. By \"speech acts\" I include not just spoken words but writing and visual images—all the materials that give an institution interiority, as if it has a face, as well as feelings, thoughts, or judgments. They might say, for example, \"the university regrets,\" or just simply, \"we regret.\" More specifically, in this paper, I examine documents that are authorized by institutions (such as race-equality policies, which are often signed by, say, the vice-chancellor on behalf of an institution), make claims about the institution (for instance, by describing the institution as having certain qualities, such as being diverse), or point toward future action (by committing an institution to a course of action, such as diversity or equality, which in turn might involve the commitment of resources).Such speech acts do not do what they say: they do not, as it were, commit a person, organization, or state to an action. Instead, they are nonperformatives. They are speech acts that read as if they are performatives, and this \"reading\" generates its own effects. For John Langshaw Austin a performative refers to a particular class of speech. An utterance is performative when it does what it says: \"the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action\" (1975, 6). For Austin, conditions have to be in place to allow such words to act, or in his terms, to allow performatives to be \"happy.\" The \"action\" of the performative is not in the \"words,\" or if it is \"in\" the words, it is \"in\" them only in so far as the words are \"in the right place\" to secure the effect that they name. Performatives succeed when they are uttered by the right person, to the right people, and in a way that takes the right form. As Judith Butler argues, \"performativity must be understood not as a singular or deliberate 'act', but, rather as the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names\" (1993, 2, emphasis added).The speech acts that commit the university to equality, I suggest, are non-performatives.1 They \"work\" precisely by not bringing about the effects that they name. For Austin, failed performatives are \"unhappy\": they do not act because the conditions are not in place that are required for the action to succeed (for example, if the person who apologizes is insincere then the apology would be unhappy). In my model of the \"nonperformative,\" the failure of the speech act to do what it says is not a failure of intent or even circumstance, but it is actually what the speech act is doing. In other words, the nonperformative does not \"fail to act\" because of conditions that are external to the speech act: rather, it \"works\" because it fails to bring about what it names. My paper will be structured by taking up four specific forms of institutional speech acts: admissions, commitments, performances, and descriptions.Second, in this paper, I want to suggest that the nonperformativity of antiracist speech acts requires a new approach to the relation between texts and social action, which I will be calling \"an ethnography of texts.\" Such an approach still considers texts as actions, which \"do things,\" but it also suggests that \"texts\" are not \"finished\" as forms of action, as what they \"do\" depends on how they are \"taken up.\" To track what texts do, we need to follow them around. If texts circulate as documents or objects within public culture, then our task is to follow them, to see how they move as well as how they get stuck. So rather than just looking at university documentation on diversity for what it says, although I do this, as close readings are important and necessary, I also ask what they do, in part by talking to practitioners who use these documents to support their actions. This paper hence draws on interviews with diversity and equal opportunities officers or staff from personnel units with responsibility for diversity at ten universities in the United Kingdom, an analysis of policy documents and my own participation in discussions within universities and policy conferences.The academic and political background to this research is provided by scholarship in critical race studies that has analyzed institutional racism in higher education in the United Kingdom, in all of its complexity (Modood and Acland 1998; Shiner and Madood 2002; Law, Phillips, and Turney 2004). My argument extends this work by pointing to a relationship between the new discourses of racial equality and the extension of institutional racism. In other words, rather than considering the turn to promoting racial equality as a sign of overcoming institutional racism, my argument will explore the \"terms\" on which this promotion is happening within higher education.In order to reflect on the politics of institutional speech acts, I want to think first about a politics of admission. I begin by analyzing the concept of institutional racism and the paradoxes that follow when institutional racism becomes part of institutional language. This has happened in the United Kingdom, where institutions (in particular, the police) have either recognized themselves as being institutionally racist or have adopted a definition of institutional racism within their race-equality policies. The Macpherson Report (1999) on the police handling of the murder of a young Black man, Stephen Lawrence, has been the key in this public turn. The Macpherson Report is an important document insofar as it recognizes the police force as \"institutionally racist.\" According to the report, institutional racism amounts to \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people\" (1).The language of institutional racism was not, of course, invented by the report, but it draws on a long history of Black activism and scholarship. How is this language used here? Defining an institution as racist involves recognition of the collective rather than individual nature of racism. Moreover, it forecloses what is meant by collective and institutional by seeing evidence of that collectivity only in what institutions fail to do. In other words, the report defines institutional racism in such a way that racism is not seen as an ongoing series of actions that shape institutions or the norms that get reproduced or posited over time. We might wish to see racism as a form of doing or even a field of positive action, rather than as a form of inaction. For instance, we might wish to examine how institutions become White through the positing of some bodies rather than others as the subjects of the institution (querying, for example, who the institution is shaped for and who it is shaped by). Racism would not be evident in what we fail to do, but what we have already done, whereby the \"we\" is an effect of the doing. The recognition of institutional racism within the Macpherson Report reproduces the whiteness of institutions by seeing racism simply as the failure to provide for non-White others because of a difference that is somehow theirs.It is worth noting that psychological language that creeps into the definition: \"processes, attitudes, and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping\" (Macpherson Report 1999, 1). In a way, the institution becomes recognized as racist only through being posited as an individual, as someone who suffers from prejudice but who could be treated so that they would act better toward racialized others. To say \"we are racist\" is here translated into the statement it seeks to replace, \"I am racist,\" where \"our racism\" is described as a bad practice that can be changed through learning more tolerant attitudes and behavior. Indeed, if the institution becomes like the individual, then one suspects that the institution also takes the place of individuals: it is the institution that is the bad person rather than this person or that person. In other words, the transformation of the collective into an individual (a collective without individuals) might allow individual actors to deny or refuse responsibility for collective forms of racism.But there is more to understanding how institutional racism becomes an institutional admission. What does it mean for a subject or institution to posit itself as being racist? If racism is shaped by actions that do not get seen by those who are its beneficiaries, what does it mean for those beneficiaries to see it? I would suggest that such admissions might work both by claiming to see racism (in what the institution fails to do) and by maintaining the definition of racism as unseeing. If racism is defined as unwitting and collective prejudice, then the claim to be racist by being able to see racism in this or that form of practice is also a claim not to be racist in the same way.The paradoxes of admitting to one's own racism are clear: saying \"we are racist\" becomes a claim to have overcome the conditions (unseen racism) that require the speech act in the first place. The logic is, first, we say, \"we are racist,\" and insofar as we can admit to being racist (and racists are unwitting), then we show that \"we are not racist,\" or at least that we are not racist in the same way. What is important here is that the admission converts swiftly into a declarative mode: the speech act, in its performance, is taken up as having shown that the institution has overcome what it is that the speech act admits to. Simply put, admissions of racism become readable as declarations of commitment to antiracism. What does this conversion of admissions into commitments do?In the United Kingdom, there has been a proliferation of documents on race equality; we might even say that race equality is increasingly being documented or turned into documents. The circulation of race-equality documents in the public sector is a direct result of the 2000 Race Relations Amendment Act, which requires all public bodies to have and enforce a race-equality and action plan. This is an important piece of legislation insofar as race equality now becomes a positive duty; something that organizations must do. The first specific duty under the act for higher and further education organizations is that they must write a race-equality policy. The RRAA has fascinated me partly as it has generated a huge amount of documentation: the documentation is, as it were, one of the objects of the act, what it points toward.My own experience of writing such a document as part of a race-equality team was instructive. We adopted the Macpherson definition of \"institutional racism\" in the document, although we fell short of naming our institution itself as \"being institutionally racist.\" In working on this policy, we tried to bring a critical language of antiracism into the wording of the document. This meant that in the document we identified inequalities and racism as the history behind the document: in other words, we took up \"diversity\" and \"equality\" as terms within the document given that they do not describe the institution.I was taught a good lesson, which of course means a hard lesson: the language we think of as critical can easily lend itself to the very techniques of governance we critique. So we wrote the document, and the university was praised for its policy by the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU), and the vice chancellor was able to congratulate the university on its performance: we did well. At a meeting with staff, the vice chancellor praised staff for their excellent work, referring to the letter from the ECU. It was a feel good moment, but those of us who wrote the document did not feel so good. A document that documented the racism of the university became usable as a measure of good performance. Here, having a good race-equality policy quickly got translated into being good at race equality. Such a translation works to conceal the very inequalities that the documents were written to reveal. The document becomes a fetishized object, something that has value by being cut off from the process of documentation. In other words, its very existence is taken as evidence that the institutional environment documented by the document (racism, inequality, injustice) has been overcome; as if by saying that we \"do it\" means that's no longer what we do.Such documents function as statements of commitment to race equality: indeed, such commitments are often made in the first sentences of the policies. Having a race-equality policy, especially having a \"good race-equality policy,\" is about making an institutional commitment public. The documents are read as signs of commitment and in turn seem to commit the institution to doing something. Or do they?Let me quote from the opening paragraphs of two race-equality policies: The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA 2000) places a requirement on a wide range of public authorities, including all Further and Higher Education institutions, to promote race equality in a proactive way through all their functions and to publish a Race Equality Policy. This Race Equality Policy has been published to inform all [xxx] staff and students and all other partners of our institutional commitment under the requirements of the RRAA 2000. [xxx] recognises that by embracing diversity it can achieve its ultimate goal to become a 'world class University' and pursue excellence in research, teaching and clinical service.. . .[xxx] values its diverse community and is opposed to racism in all its forms. The [xxx] is committed to the fair and equal treatment of all individuals and aims to ensure that no-one in the [xxx] community is disadvantaged on the grounds of race, cultural background, ethnic or national origin or religious belief.These documents show the different ways in which the university is imagined as a subject with a commitment to race equality. In the first one, the policy begins with law: it frames the institutional commitment in terms of compliance with law. In a way, then, the document names its commitment by framing that commitment as a requirement: we commit insofar as we are required to do so. Commitment here is literally under the law. We might note that while this institutional commitment is named, it is not named as a commitment to something; we are simply committed to whatever the law commits us to do.The second quote seems to take us further, insofar as it names racism and declares the organization as being opposed to racism. At the same time, the statement also functions to bring the organization into the policy as being antiracist, a self-declaration that ironically can participate in the concealment of racism within the university. Declaring a commitment to opposing racism might function as a form of organizational pride: antiracism as a speech act might then accumulate value for the organization, as a sign of its own commitment. A university that commits to antiracism might also be one that does not recognize racism as an ongoing reality, or if it did recognize such racism, then it would be more likely to see that racism as coming from \"strangers\" outside of the institution rather than \"natives\" inside it. It is as if the university now says, if we are committed to antiracism (and we have said we are), then how can we be racists? Declarations of commitment can block recognition of racism. Paradoxically, the recognition of racism can be taken up as a sign of commitment, which in turn blocks the recognition of racism. The work of such speech acts seems to be precisely how they function to hinder rather than enable action. In other words, the failure, or the nonperformativity, of antiracist speech acts is a mechanism for the reproduction of institutional authority, which conceals the ongoing reality of racism.In one 2005 newspaper article about racism experienced by international students at Royal Holloway, we can see exactly this mechanism at work. Students from Korea complained about racism experienced on campus and about the failure of the college to respond adequately: \"Students, particularly east Asian students, feel fearful of these attacks and are deeply concerned that something should be done. But, they have no proper channels of complaint and are worried that too much noise would have a negative effect on their status at college\" (Pai 2005, 3). The article highlights the multiples ways that racism can affect the experiences of Black and Asian students: it can involve direct violence, and it also affects how students respond to such violence, fearing that reporting racism would lead to further marginalization. But the response of the college to this report was to deny the students' charges: \"Royal Holloway's spokeswoman said: 'This could not be further from the truth. The college prides itself on its levels of pastoral care'\" (Pai 2005, 3, emphasis added). In other words, organizational pride and the self-perception of being good block the recognition of racism. Organizational pride in being good at hearing messages prevents the message getting through. Such a speech act does exactly what it says that it does not do: it refuses to hear complaint in the very moment it says that it does hear complaint. If colleges have pride in their policies of pastoral care and antiracism, then they also fail to hear about racism. Being committed to antiracism can function as a perverse performance of racism: \"you\" are wrong to describe us as uncaring and racist because \"we\" are committed to being antiracist. Antiracism functions here as a discourse of organizational pride.As I have suggested, many of the race-equality documents function as statements of commitment and take a simple form: \"we are committed to. . . . \" Such statements of commitment might work to limit rather than enable action, insofar as they block recognition of the ongoing nature of what it is the organization is committed to opposing. However, we can still ask the question, what do statements of commitment commit institutions to do?When asking practitioners about this process of writing race-equality policies, I ask specifically about statements of commitment. What do they (or do they?) commit the university to do? In the following exchange between me and three interviewees from the personnel department of a university, we can see the hesitation that follows such a question.Question: It's a statement of commitment clearly as many of them are, do you feel that the statement itself commits the university to something?Responses:I would say yes but don't say why.Yes it does, but my angle, I suppose, is that you have to have reminders, examples, arguments all the time.And I think it's a good working document that people can take with them.But people don't like being told to read it.Yes they don't like it.We don't like being told we have to tick these boxes.It is true, but it exists, and I think it's a reference document and people will go back and read it if they wanted to find out something. But people don't want to be told to read it.If we took statements of commitment as performatives, we would say that they commit a person to something. But such performativity is not assumed by practitioners. The first response is that the statement of commitment does \"commit,\" but for unknown reasons. This uncertainty is itself telling, for it suggests that commitment is in some way mysterious and would need to be explained. In other words, the commitment does not simply follow the letter of the document. The word \"commitment\" does not do what it says. The second response also is a \"yes\" but a qualified one: the statement of commitment does commit, but it has to be supplemented by other forms of institutional pressure (reminders, examples, and so on). In other words, the commitment is not given by the document but depends on the work generated around the document. It is interesting that the next intervention begins with further qualification: \"but people don't like to be told to read it.\" If the statement of commitment does not necessarily commit the university to doing anything, then practitioners have to keep up the pressure; it is this pressure that can mean that documents do not work. This is a telling pressure for diversity workers: we have to put pressure on the document because it does not work, and the pressure on documents is what makes them not work. The compulsion to read the document means that it loses rather than gains currency. If people are required to read it, then they \"don't like it.\" Indeed, the following utterance moves from \"they don't like it\" to \"we don't like being told to tick these boxes.\" The commitment itself becomes a \"tick\" in the box. Now \"commitment\" is usually described in opposition to the \"tick box\"; a tick box approach to diversity would be where institutions go along with the process, but are not \"behind\" the action. For commitment to become a tick in the box is to suggest that \"being behind\" can itself be a matter of institutional performance. We create the illusion of being behind an action, even at the moment the action is not performed.The final utterance describes the statement of commitment as a \"reference document\" that people can use. This document then exists insofar as people refer back to it, as something that can help them to do things. Such documents by implication can only work if they are not obligatory: if people do not have to use them, then they might work. What this sequences of utterance shows is not only how documents of commitment are perceived as non-commitments in and of themselves but also how this lack of commitment in the document—which implies that we have to be committed to them to make them work—is what makes them less likely to generate commitment in others.The question then becomes where commitment is located, if it is not in the statements of commitment or in the people who generate such statements. Why does commitment matter so much to diversity and equality work, if it seems always not to be where it should be? I asked why statements of commitment matter to another practitioner: Oh that's hard. I think you cannot not have them, if you don't have them, well to me as a practitioner it's a starting point, again it's whether that gets fitted into practice. Commitments can't come without other actions. So the commitment to me is about what the institution believes in and what it intends to do—it can't stand alone, it has to come with how you're actually going to do it. I think if they weren't there then, well I refer to them quite a lot as you well know, if you're trying to, let's say there's an issue that's come up and somebody is not, maybe there's an issue and perhaps they're racist in what they bring up in their practice or something like that, and it's good to refer back to these documents, but actually you're an employee of the university and the university has made a statement about this. So in terms of watching the other members of staff and in my own experience, I've used it for that.The sentence \"commitments can't come without other actions\" is instructive because it suggests that commitment is an action, but it is one that does not act on its own. Instead, it depends on other actions, or on what is done with it. Commitment might be, in other words, a technology that can be used or deployed within specific settings. The work of commitment is how you act on the action: it is about what the action allows the practitioner to do. The statement of commitment is also described as a reference point, something you can use, when challenging how people act within the institution. In other words, the statement of commitment does not commit the institution to anything, but it allows the practitioner to support their claims for or against specific action. The statement functions as a supporting device.So although a statement of commitment can block action by constructing the university or organization as already committed to race equality, these statements also can support other actions precisely by giving this illusion of being behind. Practitioners use such statements to challenge people within the organization, by showing they are \"out of line\" with the direction of the organization, even if this line is itself imaginary and does not direct institutional action. Documents do not simply have a referential or descriptive function: it is not simply that they describe principles that a university already has. Indeed, in a way, the documents might even perform a lie insofar as they represent the university as if it has principles that it does not have. But this can be a useful lie: by producing the university as if it was a subject with such principles, the documents then become usable as they allow practitioners to make members of the university as well as the university itself as an imagined entity subject to those principles. Statements of commitment then might do something, not in and of themselves, but because they enable the exposure of a gap between what organizations say they do, and what they actually do: indeed, they might \"do something\" insofar as they fail to describe what organizations do.So what work are these documents doing in their failure to bring about the effects that they name? Such documents arguably are forms of institutional performance. They are ways in which universities perform an image of themselves, to be sure, but they are also ways in which universities perform in the sense of \"doing well.\" To return to my own experience of writing a diversity document: the document that documents racism becomes usable as a measure of good performance. What does it mean for \"equality\" and \"diversity\" to be seen as measurable in the first place? Are they becoming boxes to be ticked? Or a \"paper trail\" that goes nowhere?Diversity and equality are increasingly discussed in the United Kingdom through an emphasis on good practice. Although good practice is often seen as \"beyond the tick box\" (or rather, the tick box approach is seen as bad practice), I would suggest that \"the tick box\" and the \"good practice\" are part of the same vocabulary. The tick box shows we have done it (whatever we do) while the good practice shows we have done it (whatever we do), where the \"it\" is taken as a sign of good performance. Good practice guides and tool-kits are produced based on the principle that the best way of improving institutional performance is to share good practice. These documents too move around. An example can be taken from the ECU toolkit on communications, \"Good Talking: The HE Communicators Equality and Diversity Toolkit,\" which includes the following as an example of \"general good practice\": \"University of Southampton has produced institutional equality and diversity gifts and novelties that are in great demand.\" For diversity novelties to become a sign of good practice is clear evidence of how diversity is being repackaged, as if it was a property of objects that can be passed around. So an organization even gets a \"tick\" for its novelties.The RRAA signals a shift within the public sectors toward seeing equality and diversity as performance indicators, as things that can be measured. Heidi Mirza (2005) has described this as the \"bureaucratisation of diversity.\" Indeed, the RRAA has encouraged the shift toward seeing diversity and equality work as auditable. Audit culture not only measures performance but it depends on the reliability of such measurements. It also associates good performance with accountability, efficiency, and quality, assumed goals for organizations (Powers 1994, 1). Race equality would be something that could be measured, such that doing well would become an indicator of institutional good performance. In other words, race equality would be a sign of accountability, efficiency, and quality.Practitioners expressed mixed feelings about equality and diversity becoming auditable. Some suggested that to audit equality and diversity would be a good thing, as universities only take seriously the activities that are audited and attached to financial returns or penalties. As one interviewee describes, \"I think it would be useful in the HE sector because it wouldn't have been done, just thinking about how they could operate and how they've been lagging behind, it was the push, you know you had to do it.\" Audit becomes here a \"stick\" that would compel action, as a compulsion that energizes or creates an institutional drive. Others suggested that audit would not necessarily work, given how audit culture works as a kind of awareness of itself. As one director of personnel elaborates: An audit can establish if we have gone through processes, it can't really determine whether we are altering culture here. It can perhaps show whether we are reaching various targets, say you know, the same teacher of leadership staff who come from various backgrounds over time. But the trouble is when dealing with audit you tend always to respond in terms of process you know, we've done this report, we've got a plan out and all that sort of stuff. And I could see that you could get a rough idea if universities were putting effort into diversity by doing that, but the trouble is that in universities we've got an audit-aware culture in administrations. And so people are practiced at how to show auditors that processes are being gone through.So if diversity and equality were audited, then u",

      "abstract": "In talking of using the media to mental health, we are up against a difficulty from the start. We cannot promote mental health in the same sense as we might an object or a personality not even in the same way that we might, in the interests of physical health, a diet or a set of exercises or even a life-style. The factors that contribute to the mental health of an individual or a society are too subtle, too tenuous; and the means by which they are achieved, on purpose or accidentally, are too diffused and too deeply enmeshed in our social roots to be easily affected by direct action. Even indirect action in this area is complex. Professionals in mental health might well decide that its interests would be served if, for example, more mentally handicapped people were shown in TV dramas to be leading comparatively normal lives, or if those who have nervous breakdowns were dealt with more sympathetically; they might think it better for characters to be shown coping with their problems mainly on their own or in their families, rather than invariably calling in a doctor. It might be thought a step forward, in our fragmented society, if there were more positive images of people living successfully on their own, rather than so often finding fulfillment only in a happy-ever-after partnership; it might help if someone with an alcohol problem were seen to tackle it successfully, rather than being portrayed only as a drunken lout. We could devise endless ways in which the media might further the cause of mental health; but there would be no obvious means by which we could induce editors and producers of programs to fall in with our wishes.",

      "title": "The 'inclusive engineering' approach: an optimum diameter for ease of opening",
      "abstract": "Social equality demands a shift in attitude, away from treating older people and people with disabilities as special cases requiring special design solutions, and towards enabling them to have equal access to any product or service through a more inclusive approach to the design of buildings, public spaces and, more recently, products and services. This is not just important for social equality but also for business growth through new products and services and through creating wider potential markets.\r\nIt is a sad fact of life that as people get older there is a massive decline in their strength and dexterity. Due to the fact that we handle and manipulate so many things\r\nthroughout our life time, from the tiniest and most dexterous of tasks to heavy manual labour, this decline is very noticeable in our hands. In nearly all the actions that we use our hands for there is some form of grip used in order to hold onto an object before manipulating it. The natural decrease in strength combined with debilitating illness such as arthritis, means that hand grip strength or finger grip strength are very seriously affected.\r\nThis has a knock on affect of making it much harder to twist things or pinch and pull things. Therefore there is often a measured decrease in torque strength with age caused not so much by a decrease in wrist strength but more often than not by a decrease in grip strength.\r\nConsumer packaging is a field in which many people, including young able bodied people, often struggle in relation to openability. Yet it is present in even the most mundane and neccessary of every day tasks such as eating, cleaning teeth, even drinking. Human interation with consumer packaging requires a wide range of hand dexterity and strength and a variety of differing hand actions. This paper looks at just one such set of actions; that used to open bottles and jars. It outlines all the arguments for inclusive design, stressing the importance for both consumers and business. This paper also outlines an engineering design approach for inclusive design that uses real human factors as design limits, resulting in packaging that will be easily opened by all it’s end users without the expensive trial and error approach that has been used up to this point in time. This paper examines the affect of\r\ngrip strength on the required trorque to open closures and concludes that there is an optimum diameter for ease of opening that will decrease the required strength to open such closures.",

      "abstract": "Dehumanization involves failing to acknowledge that another person has the full suite of emotions, cognitions and capabilities associated with being human. Recent work has described two distinct types or dimensions: mechanistic and animalistic (Haslam, 2006; Haslam & Loughnan, 2014). Mechanistic dehumanization involves denying someone characteristics of human nature such as emotionality and interpersonal warmth, and a tendency to perceive them as cold, rigid and lacking in animation, much like automata. Animalistic dehumanization involves perceiving someone as devoid of uniquely human characteristics such as civility and higher cognition, and a tendency to view them as coarse, unintelligent and immoral, much like animals. Dehumanization on either dimension has consequences for our ability to see others as victims, and to experience moral outrage at their victimization (Gray, Gray & Wegner, 2007; Bastian et al., 2011). Our project will examine whether dehumanization of female victims on either dimension influences our assessment of the wrongness of male consent violations and deserved punishment. Participants will read scenarios of heterosexual encounters containing consent violations by a male. The female will be varied between subjects to reflect a profile that encourages humanization or dehumanization on one or both dimensions. Participants’ moral outrage at the male as well as the severity of punishment deserved will be assessed. We expect dehumanization along either dimension will attenuate both measures. However, mechanistically dehumanized females are regarded as cognitively capable, and thus more blame-worthy and less deserving of protection. Those victim scenarios may experience more attenuated levels of outrage and punishment.\r\nDiscipline: Psychology (Honours)\r\nFaculty Mentor: Dr. Aimee Skye",

Since all disasters derive from human causation, the crux of each comes down to one element: the \"fourth\" environment, the people's culture. From origin to development, reaction to recovery, culture is the driver that facilitates, frames, and guides disaster. People's prior experiences of disaster also create a pervasive idea of what peril exists or what a disaster will entail. Tales of former disasters led people to deny weather predictions and remain in their houses during both Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina. The most mysterious factor in people's relation to the environment, and subsequently in their vulnerability to disaster, is place attachment.

      "abstract": "A fetish is a more or less concrete object of sexual desire. It can be a part of the body, an object, a situation, or some abstraction. Breasts, buttocks, feet, hair, and genitals belong to the parts of the body; clothing, shoes, whips, dildos, uniforms, cars, or specific materials such as leather, silk, satin, velvet, and rubber are possible objects; situations can be cinemas, saunas, dark rooms, dinner tables, beaches, or prison cells; and more abstract examples of fetishism include youth, beauty, hospitality, power, submission, and humiliation. Ultimately, any part of the body, object, situation, or abstraction can become a fetish and, on the other hand, all sexual pleasure depends on fetishes. Naming or reading the word can be as exciting as the object to which it refers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas proposes a radical re-interpretation of the sixth commandment in which the prohibition of homicide holds in all times and all situations. He assigns bloodshed no foundational function. Instead he sees in the face to face encounter of one human with another the recognition in each of the vulnerable “you” which precludes the possibility of homicide. Lévinas cites Jacob’s fear of killing his brother Esau as proof that the fear of killing is stronger than fear of death itself. The ego does not precede the encounter but rather “I” is constituted in the recognition of the other. Thus Lévinas moves beyond Jesus’s “you must love your neighbor as yourself” and urges “Love your neighbor; he is yourself.”",

      "abstract": "This experiment extends the growing literature aimed at identifying the conditions that impel people to make religious attributions. A total of 177 subjects were presented a series of 16 vignettes after each of which they provided an attributional analysis. The event depicted in each vignette was either (a) an action or occurrence having (b) a positive or negative outcome that was (c) life-altering or non-life-altering. Subjects selected their attributions from a menu that included religious causal agents (God, Satan), several naturalistic causes (e.g., the protagonist's characteristics, other actors), and nonreligious-supernaturalistic causes (fate, luck). As predicted, attributions to God were most commonly made when the event was a life-altering occurrence having positive consequences. Attributions to Satan, rarely made, were prompted by life-altering events having negative consequences. As for whether subjects exhibited a God-of-the-gaps pattern of causal reasoning, the evidence was mixed but tended to support the conclusion that they did not.",

      "abstract": "“Utility,” in plain English, means usefulness . In Australia, a ute is a useful vehicle. Jeremy Bentham specialized the meaning to a particular sort of usefulness. “By utility,” he said, “is meant that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness (all this in the present case comes to the same thing) or (what comes again to the same thing) to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered” (1823, p. 2). The “principle of utility” is the principle that actions are to be judged by their usefulness in this sense: their tendency to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness. When John Stuart Mill (1969, p. 213) spoke of the “perfectly just conception of Utility or Happiness, considered as the directive rule of human conduct,” he was using “Utility” as a short name for this principle. “The greatest happiness principle” was another name for it. People who subscribed to this principle came to be known as utilitarians.",

The insane are first men, and secondarily diseased men; and in a due consideration of this order of things lies the main secret of the successful treatment of such. The drunkard is first a man and secondarily a man with a peculiar weakness. The convict is, in like manner, first a man, and then a sinner…; but when the keeper watches a hundred men herded together in virtue of the one common characteristic of their being criminals, the guilt becomes the prominent circumstance and there is an end of the brotherly faith in each, to which each must mainly owe his cure. This, in our human weakness, is the great evil attendant upon the good of collecting together sufferers under any particular physical or moral evil. Visitors are shy of the blind, the deaf and dumb, and insane, when they see them all together, while they would feel little or nothing of this shyness, if they met each sufferer in the bosom of his own family.

But how can we know in the case of someone else which outward behaviour patterns are signs of which inner states?

It is thus notsurprising that the conceptualization of fear in the book of Deuteronomy is strongly linked to the activation and moral formation of both individual and community. On the one hand, and especially in the book’s eve-of-battle rhetoric, fear is something to be avoided and confined so that it does not contaminate the entire community (“fear not!”). On the other hand, whenits object is the nation’s deity, fear is something to be learned and taught (“so that they may learn to fear me… and teach theirchildren for ever”). In both capacities, fear in Deuteronomy has an extraordinary potential to shape the social order. It has akey role to play in stabilizing society and promoting both collective and individual flourishing, while also being understoodas a destabilizing, destructive force that is to be quarantined as if it were a contagious virus. </",

Will any ofyour readers deny any ofdie following statements? 1.Almost all greyhounds can run faster than dachshunds; alsatians are more likely to bite you than great danes; spaniels are more sentimental than fox terriers; sheepdogs and foxhounds display an inherited capacity for dieir professions. But they can all interbreed, like the different races ofHomo sapiens. 2.Any characteristic ofa biological population follows a statistical distribution curve: size, speed, endurance, enterprise, a capacity for mathematics, music, or hunting, anything that can conceivably be measured. 3.These distribution curves are not usually the same for different characteristics or different populations. 4.In any human population a man with any particular intellectual, social, athletic, emotional, or adventurous capacity is trained by the company he keeps toward marrying a woman, or the sister of a man, with diat capacity. Thus groups arise with specially developed mental, social, and physical characteristics; and diese are inherited. 5.Inherited racial differences obviously exist in man in respect of physical qualities. It is hard to believe that intellectual, emotional, and social differences are not based on qualities inherent in the nervous system (reacting of course with social and physical environment) and so can be passed on by inheritance and modified by selection. The only alternative is to suppose that die Creator standardized his invention at the start and has not since let selection work. None of this implies that racial differences imply moral superiority. The strongest contender for die proposition that all men are equal would not claim diat all footballers are equal. It is not immoral to inquire why one footballer is better than another, or why men (on the average) can run faster than women. It is not wicked to ask whether diere are more, orfewer, potential poets ormathematicians amongAfrican childrendian among European ones, or whedier the poets ormadiematicians, when diey mature, will be radier different or kind. It takes all kinds to make a world; it would be a pity to insist, ifall men are not equal at everything, that the differences must be ironed out or hushed up. That seems to me dishonest.

      "title": "Self-realization",
      "abstract": "‘Self-realization’ is the development and expression of characteristic attributes and potentials in a fashion which comprehensively discloses their subject’s real nature. Usually, the ‘self’ in question is the individual person, but the concept has also been applied to corporate bodies held to possess a unitary identity. What constitutes the self’s ‘real nature’ is the key variable generating the many conceptions of self-realization. These can be grouped broadly into two types: (1) the ‘collectivist’, in which the self-realizing lifestyle, being either the same for all or specific to a person or subgroup of people, is ultimately definable only in the context, and perhaps with reference to the common purposes, of a collective social body; (2) the ‘individualist’, in which a person’s self-realization has no necessary connection with the ends of a particular community. As an ethic, self-realization can be proposed as the means to achieve a life identified as good by some criterion independent of the self-realizing process, or held to be that which actually defines the good. Its critics typically argue that human nature is such that any equation of ‘self-realization’ and ‘goodness’ is implausible or undesirable.",

      "title": "Acquisition of Resources Without a Prior Owner’ s Consent: Minerals, Capture, Found Property",
      "abstract": "Abstract One person may voluntarily transfer property to another. As we will see, writers in the Aristotelian tradition described these transfers as acts of commutative justice, if they were intended to obtain an equivalent for what was given, or as acts of liberality, if they were intended to enrich the other party at the giver’ s expense. Alternatively, a person may acquire property that did not previously belong to anyone else. Under Roman law, he might catch an animal or find an object which no one else owned or whose owner could not be identified. Often, he obtained title to such an object by occupatio or raking possession of it. Some modem philosophers have seen in occupatio or first possession or in some kindred concept the origin of all property. For John Locke, since each person owned his own labor, one who mixed his labor with an object thereby became its owner. He left it unclear what one had to do to mix one’ s labor with an object beyond taking possession of it. According to Immanuel Kant, one could appropriate anything that was not previously owned or used by someone else. He rested this idea on the will. The will would pointlessly lose some of its freedom if a person could not appropriate some thing that no one else owned or was using. For both philosophers, after resources had originally been acquired in these ways, they could then be legitimately transferred from one person to another by agreement in the absence of force or fraud.",

      "title": "In the depth of psychic ignorance: Self-mutilation in the alleviation of suffering—A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction: In several cultures—primitive, modern, and contemporary—the body represents an object of communication. According to the definition of the Descriptors in Health Science, self-mutilation is the “act of damaging one’s own body until permanent destruction of a limb or other essential body region is achieved.” Self-mutilation is a kind of agreement to avoid total annihilation of the person, in other words, suicide. In this perspective, it represents a victory, sometimes a pyrrhic victory, of the life drive over the death drive, where a dichotomous relationship is assumed. Case Report: An 18-year-old, female, student, smoker, alcoholic, refers that she doesn’t use illicit drugs. She reports that months before her mother’s death she started self-mutilating behaviors on her arm, forearm, and thigh. When asked about the reasons that drove her to practice physical injuries on her own body, the patient verbalized: “I feel relief when I provoke another pain different from the one I feel internally.” She adds: “I don’t feel panic when I see blood running down my arm”; “today I am no longer able to cry, so I feel the need to inflict self-injury.” She affirms that at the moment before the mutilation acts, she is balanced, and there are no triggering factors for the injuries. Conclusion: The undeniable psychic precariousness makes this “private” self-mutilation show, in the recourse to the act-pain, the conceivable damage truly experienced by the subject. In this dimension of absence or emptiness and when facing the act of self-mutilation, the physician is called to exercise not to capture the look of the mutilated body, but to resort to the artifices of a clinic whose ethics is based on listening to a subject trapped in the repetition of the same.",

The question invokes a contrast between events that are actions, in which the higher faculties of human beings come into play, and those movements of a person's body – instances of behavior other than actions, or mere bodily happenings – that he does not himself make. This contrast can evidently be generalized. It is a special case of the contrast between activity and passivity, which is considerably wider in scope.",

      "title": "The Naturalness Preference",
      "abstract": "Two reasons prevail for preferring natural products over those that appear to be “unnatural”. The first root is instrumental reasons, which are concrete, measurable benefits in a “natural” product over an “unnatural” one. The second root of the naturalness preference is ideational reasoning, which is a belief in moral superiority of one product over another even if they are chemically the same. Meng Li found that people tend to claim their naturalness preference is based on instrumental thinking when their preference is actually ideational (based on ideology). This explains why chemophobia is not abated when people are taught scientific facts. Instead, seeing one claim of moral superiority on a product (e.g. organic) causes people to make a suite of other generically morally positive assumptions about the same product (e.g. environmentally friendly, organic, natural, more nutritious, etc.). Marketers exploit this psychology by making nebulous claims on their packaging—or even by merely invoking natural/green imagery and textures—and the consumer assumes a suite of other ethically positive attributes that makes that product more attractive to them. Some brands are able to make a lot of money by exploiting this technique without breaking any laws.",

      "title": "\"On the Brink of Tears and Laughter\" Joy and Suffering in the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas",
      "abstract": "The idea of enjoyment (jouissance), of “life as love of life,” is a crucial preconditional aspect in Levinas’s ethical thought. The self takes satisfaction in its own being by consuming the outside world through enjoyment, through making the Other into the Same. For Levinas, however, it is the face of the other person that interrupts my enjoyment and calls me to responsibility: “one has to first enjoy one’s bread, not in order to have the merit of giving it, but in order to give it with one’s heart, to give oneself in giving it.” My enjoyment thereby becomes meaningful in the other. Levinas also attempts to “envisage suffering . . . in the inter-human perspective - that is, as meaningful in me, useless in the Other.” In the context of his philosophical project, this move is necessary, lest my suffering become an alibi for the suspension of my responsibility, and lest one see the Other’s suffering as theodicy, as part of God’s plan. Unlike enjoyment, my suffering, “at the limit of its ‘usefulness,’” is precisely that which “does not fit in me.” This idea of an outside that cannot be assimilated and that instead assimilates or changes me is the essence of revelation. Nevertheless, Levinas does not address the fact that personal, even expiatory, suffering may often have more problematic interpersonal dimensions.",

It jumps along to catch the ball. The father yells at the dog, telling it not to bite the football, but too late. The dog wants to be part of the game. It catches the ball, it bites and the ball bursts. The boy cries and the father yells at the dog. The dog cowers and takes its tail between its legs. The boy and the father pity the dog, who they love, and now engage in a new game with a dog-friendly ball instead. How is this situation accomplished? Is it all about human actions? Is it the ball that rolls that makes the situation? Is it all about the dog’s behaviour? Where is the agency? Who is morally responsible for what? How can we analytically approach such situations?

      "abstract": "Cardiac surgery: a complex system Heart surgery has much in common with other high technology systems in which performance and outcomes depend on multifaceted interactions of individual, technical and organizational factors. In addition, our specialty often functions as a chaotic/emergent system since the initial circumstances vary in patients with the same medical condition resulting in uncertainty and lack of predictability [1]. Complexity: The American Heritage Dictionary defines complex and complicated as “things whose parts are so interconnected or interwoven as to make the whole perplexing”. If we add rarity and small numbers to complexity, the results is a distinctiveness that explains many aspects of our profession and specialty such as variability with institutional differences in outcomes; inconsistency of results in treating rare diseases and uncertainty on any inference about results of complex rare lesions [2]. A system is a set of interdependent elements that are interacting, or working together, to accomplish a common goal. All systems, at the “atomic” level, consist of individuals, activities, connections, and pathways with the following characteristics, qualities or peculiarities in complex systems: • Heterogeneity of the parties (diverse nature and multiple); • Cause-and-effect relationships may be nonlinear and obvious only in retrospect; • Richness of interaction between them (including their contradictory character); • Multidimensional and multi-referential; • Many variables commonly present; • Provide information that by itself reveals the extent of its complexity; • Under an apparent simplicity, they often hide the true dynamics of these processes and interactions between its parts • Vulnerability — Are influenced by factors and surprising circumstances that may affect, cause, or facilitate a change in behavior and expected results, altering all or changed significantly “Complex business generates complex services.

Some individuals give credence to God as an existing transcendent reality; other people oscillate between belief and unbelief at different moments of their lives while some atheists adamantly deny God’s existence. Regardless of their stance, all three groups must have a certain mental conception or representation of the divinity to be able to believe in it, wrestle with it, or deny it. Such representation has significant antecedents in both parental representations (Freud, 1910; Rizzuto, 1979) and other affectively significant early objects and obtains from them prevailing emotional characteristics, which inevitably contribute to the dynamic organization of the relational or rejecting experiences the subject has with his/her personally conceived divinity.In this paper I offer a clinical example from a completed analysis to illustrate the patient’s libidinal and defensive and, at times, organizing use of the divinity during the course of his treatment.",

      "title": "Be Like This. Norms, Examples, Documents and Indexicals from a Neo-Aristotelian Perspective",
      "abstract": "I propose an account of exemplarity based on the (neo-Aristotelian) ontological distinction between individuals and properties, and on the corresponding semantic distinction between singular terms, which single out individuals, and predicates, which designate properties. I shall focus on indexicals as paradigmatic singular terms. For instance, “this man” is an indexical, whereas “man” or “red” are predicates. I shall define an example as an individual used as a constituent of a predicate, as when one says “The color of my car is like this” pointing at a particular sample. An example, so understood, is a sort of virtual finger or wand, which turns an individual singled out by an indexical (“this”) into a predicate (“like this”). I shall develop this conception of exemplarity in order to account for the normative force of examples. First, I shall characterize a normative claim as a sentence that connects a subject to a predicate through a deontic verb (should, ought, must, can, may etc.). Then, I shall call “normative exemplarity” the case in which the predicate of a normative claim is an example, as when one says “You should behave like this man” pointing at Socrates. Finally, I shall argue that some norms can be enforced within a certain community through normative exemplarity, provided that the relevant features of the exemplar individual (that to whom the indexical refers in the expression “like this”) remain accessible to the members of the community. I shall show that if the exemplar individual does not exist anymore, the community can still keep such norms in force by relying on documents that allow the community's members to steadily preserve the relevant features of that individual. Ultimately, understanding such processes of generation and preservation of examples can contribute to explain how normative systems emerge from the historical content of the times.",

Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode deskriptif kualitatif dengan teknik pengumpulan data observasi, wawancara dan dokumentasi.

Dari hasil penelitian pandangan mereka terhadap kebiasaan membawa sekep(senjata tajam). \r\nHasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa kebiasaan masyarakat Desa Laragan Luar dalam membawa sekep(senjata tajam) terdapat beberapa alasan serta pandangan yang berbeda-beda, perinciannya sebagai berikut; (1) Jaga-jaga takut ada bahaya yang tidak di inginkan. Masyarakat larangan luar percaya bahwa dalam mempertahankan diri bukannya pasrah kepada Tuhan akan tetapi juga harus ada usaha dari diri sendiri, yaitu dengan nyikep. Maka dengan nyikep dia jiwanya merasa tenang, akan siap apabila marabahaya datang.(2) Melindungi diri dari kemungkinan bahaya. Apalagi ketika ada pesta rakyat, seperti misalnya pemilihan kepala desa, maka untuk berjaga-jaga masyarakat larangan luar nyikep.(3) Melindungi keluarga, Karena keluarga merupakan tanggung jawab, dan juga kekelurga merupakan identitas bagaimana berwibawanya sebagai pimpinan keluarga.(4) Sebagai identites. Karena nyikep merupakan identitas dan sudah menjadi tradisi di madura, khususnya masyarakat larangan luar yang sampai sekarang masih ada, dan dijaga pelestariannya.(5) Tradisi, merupakan kearifan lokal yang berlaku dilingkungan masyarakat larangan luar. Merupakan warisan dari para leluhur madura dan mewariskan dari generasi ke generasi, kearifan lokal yang berlaku di madura merupakan jati diri dari orang madura.(6) Adanya kepercayaan salah satu tanda kejantanan laki-laki selalu membawa sekep.

In addition, the blush itself can be a source of self-consciousness and\nshame. Fear of blushing (erythophobia) can be the major presenting problem\nin social phobia and social anxiety. It creates a problem in several ways. First,\nunlike body shame associated with disﬁgurements, skin diseases or body\nshape, it is experienced as an involuntary reaction. Second, awareness that one\nis blushing can intensify it; indeed, simply being told (correctly or not) that\none is blushing can induce a blush. Third, people can regard their blushing in\na negative light. Not only may they be anxious of how others evaluate them\nbecause they blush (external shame), they may interpret their dispositions to\nblush as a sign of personal weakness or evidence of social ineptness (internal\nshame). Both forms of shame can lead those who are susceptible to blush to\nengage in a variety of defensive or safety behaviours and avoid social situations in which blushing may occur. Such anxieties and defensive behaviours\ncan be heightened by the perceptions that blushing is beyond their conscious\ncontrol. Furthermore, as a blush begins attention can become more selffocused interfering with eﬀorts at social presentation and producing cognitive\noverload, which adds to anxiety, especially as other behaviours (e.g., speech\nﬂow) are interrupted (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). As discussed below, these\nconcerns can lead people to seek professional help and there are a range of\npsychological and medical approaches to intervention.",

The soft power and the hope of expanding it to the rest of the world are appealing to those who have already tasted success from their political and economic position and to those who are not too dissatisfied with the world as it is. When a single word serves so many purposes, it legitimately raises ideological suspicions. Such ambiguities have a relationship with the evolution of the meaning of the word itself but also with its semantic ecology (the other words it replaces or generates) and with its mediology; that is, the material ways and means of such a spiritual process.",

      "abstract": "The Oxford English Dictionary defines sin as 'A transgression of the divine law and an offence against God, a violation (especially wilful or deliberate) of some religious or moral principle.' According to this definition, a sin is committed when someone does something wrong: human beings are the subject and sin the object. Without a perpetrator, sin would have no existence. Yet the apostle Paul portrays sin differently. In his letter to the Romans, sin comes to life. Humanity is no longer the subject, but the object. It is no longer the person who commits the sin: rather, sin is at work within the person. In conjunction with death, sin rules over the entire world (Rom. 5:12–21). The law is powerless before it. It exploits the commandments of God for its own ends, using them to provoke the very things they were intended to prevent (7:7–13). Human nature, sold out to sin, is powerless to resist. Those who end up doing the evilthat they deplore recognise, to their dismay, that sin has taken charge of their behaviour (7:13–25). In Romans 5–8, sin is the active agent and humanity its passive victim.",

      "abstract": "Redundancy is defined as any kind of the active living organic body (including organization, organs, individuals, and even species), due to its existence, result in output reduction of individuals, population, community and even ecosystem for human's benefits. Or simply say that redundancy is the overgrowth of individual organs, plant population that expose negative effects to aim production of individual organs, population and community performance etc. To reduce the living body to a suitable level, the performance of organs, individuals, population, community and ecosystem, to human's benefit, will be increased, we call the living body redundancy. The process of redundancy occurring is the process of functional extension and its existence is helpful to maintain the stability of individuals, population and even community. According to level of redundancy that exists in life system, redundancy can be divided into individuals, population and community. Compensation or overcompensation could be realized through the reduction of the redundancy, which occurs on different levels of life system, i.e. the production of aim organs or performance of aim species population could be improved through reduction of redundancy, and the increase of the production is based on the reduction of stability of life system to variable environments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter describes five considerations which suggest that no properties are moral status enhancing. First, if some properties were moral status enhancing, an implausibly wide range of properties would be. Second, if it were possible for some properties to increase individuals’ level of moral status, it would also be possible for others to decrease it. The fact that there are no moral status decreasing properties thus implies that there are no degrees of moral status. Third, the fact that our actions do not influence our level of moral status suggests that our capacities do not either. Fourth, postulation of degrees of moral status is unable to explain why possession of some properties increases the importance of individuals’ interests, rights, or claims when it does not influence what they have at stake. Fifth, degrees of moral status requires non-arbitrary and morally relevant thresholds, which do not exist.",

      "abstract": "The paper defines philosophical categories of good and evil in the process of upbringing and development of the personality. People are good by nature. That is why they tend towards the good, they desire what is good, they feel bad and do not function well when they are touched by evil. Goodness is part of the natural environment of the human being; goodness is the natural climate of the human person. At the same time, however, people perform bad deeds. They create evil. They often harm others. This is the cause of disorder in a person's environment. It turns out that the only effective and reasonable means of restoring such order is forgiveness. It is the only thing that has a chance to realistically stop the potential avalanche of evil that appears to be the obvious result of wrongdoing and “nurturing” harm or planning revenge. The evil that “insidiously” enters the world creates the need for forgiveness as the only way to respond to harm; as a way that leads to real order in a person's environment",

      "title": "Industrial Design Support “Think Tank” Technique",
      "abstract": "“Think tank” is one of most familiar techniques frequently handled in the third millennium. A great debate is currently running about the intention of the technique and its function from the view point of its technical term vocabulary alternatives.  Most of Those who used this term regard it as a new version of group thinking techniques. That is owing to that the first syllabus of the term “think” indicates “Judgment contmplation; weighing up; Expectation, believe, or imagination. It also denotes the use or exercise of the mind or one's power to reason in order to make inferences, decisions, or to arrive at a solution , judgment; Recalling knowledge from memory; visualizing; etc., in one hand. On the other hand, the conception of the second syllabus “tank”  based on a common interpretation  would entail a large (usually metallic) vessel for holding gases or liquids; A freight car that transports liquids or gases in bulk; a cell, etc. This would allow the term “think tank” to refer -in a direct interpretation- to any group of specialists designated to to carry on an interactive discussion about a specific issue as one of contemporary group thinking techniques. In the same time and due to the lack of  deep critical interpretation of the term “think tank”  according to several investigations on the matter and the improper definition and conceptualization nobody –to our knowledge-   in the field of design in general and industrial design in particular has carried out a comprehensive  inquiry to verify the specific roll of industrial designers in supporting “think tank” technique activities. Aim of the study: The study aims at clarifying the intention, meaning and definition of the “think tank” technique, as a technical expression to eliminate misleading thoughts about the definition & function of “think tank” technique in one hand and to emphasize upon the roll that can be played by industrial designers when involved in “think tank” activities, or supporting its achievement, in view of his explicit & tacit Qualifications. Findings: Reaching  a convenient definition and concept to  “think tank” from the industrail design point of view. Compilation of the major Industrial Designers Qualifications that would assist  “think tank” activities. Issuing a set of  recommendations and evaluation criteria insurs  the proper integration of “think tank” acquaintance within the existing Industrial Design body of knowledge.",

      "abstract": "At the heart of Aristotle’s account of ethical upbringing is habituation. At least all of the virtues of character – justice, generosity, temperance, courage, and so on – just are habituated states brought about by the repeated doing of actions of a certain ethical type. We are not born courageous or cowardly (although we may have natural dispositions in one direction or the other); rather, we are made courageous or cowardly insofar as we have engaged in courageous or cowardly actions in our lives. Engaging in actions of a certain type gives rise to the corresponding habituated state of character. In short, “we become just by doing just things, temperate by doing temperate things, and courageous by doing courageous things” (N.E. ii.1, 1103a34–b2). Let us call this idea “the habituation principle” (HP). As the explicit analogy with craft (technê) in N.E. ii.1 shows, the habituation principle is itself value neutral: one becomes a good harpist or a good builder if one acquires good building or harp-playing habits, but a bad one if not; similarly one becomes a virtuous person if she engages in virtuous acts, but a bad or vicious person if one doesn’t.",

In fact, just before this, he argues that human craftsmanship enables the elements of air and water to make ships sail in opposite directions, fire to do one sort of thing in the kitchen, another in the shops of metal-workers, including the production of iron, which in its turn peacefully tills the soil or besieges the town in war. So if even human Art is capable of making something as wonderful as a clock out of the elements, how much more might God be able to do with them? [End Page 577]",

      "title": "The Doppelgänger Phenomenon and Death: A Peculiar Case of Homicide by a Subject with First-Episode Psychosis",
      "abstract": "The Doppelgänger phenomenon refers to the experience of a direct encounter with one's self, characteriswed by: (i) the perception of a figure with one's own identical physical features; or (ii) the apprehension that the perceived figure shares the same personality and identity. The Doppelgänger does not only look like the same person, it is his/her double. The perceptual element is usually a hallucination, although occasionally a false perception of an actual figure may be involved. This phenomenon has been described in individuals suffering from overwhelming fear, severe anxiety or intoxication, epilepsy, as well as in the sleep-wakefulness transition. It has also been reported in major psychoses. The fear of imminent death often precedes the Doppelgänger experience. This report presents the case of a 30-year-old man, Mr. Y, who was stabbed to death by Mr. X, his \"double\". The aggressor and his victim, although not related, were truly doubles; remarkably, they shared the same name and surname, age, professional activity and place of work. Moreover, they attended the same sports center but barely knew each other. The forensic psychiatric evaluations in Mr. X, subsequent to the crime committed, were suggestive of a psychotic condition. This case is unique in the scientific literature. In the most serious psychotic forms, the issue of the \"double\" calls into question not only the dissociative processes involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disorder, but also bio-psycho-social elements, as well as personal data in this case, which made the victim and the aggressor \"identical\". In the context of psychopathological functioning, the delusional mood (Wahnstimmung) that precedes the development of delirium is a sort of gateway to an impending psychotic illness, involving delusional awareness or mood (atmosphere). In psychosis, splitting is the main issue and this influence is seen as an evil, foreign, apocalyptic and unknown side no longer recognised as belonging to the self even in a physical sense. In such a situation, it is felt that the only way to survive is by suppressing one's double as a defense against disorganisation of the self.",

The answers must be sought in many quarters, viz. (1) a popular saying known in more than one culture, (2) the behaviour of the eye, (3) a common Jewish cluster of idioms, (4) the pious ideal in Israel on the subject of rebuke, reproof, and (5) the Law and the Prophets.

God is recogized as the infinite good, which indeed he is, but this infinity in made both so big and individualized that it elbows out all other goods. This emphatically God does not do, otherwise when we called him creator it would be only of a shadow world.

      "abstract": "Every item that an animal encounters, whether animate or inanimate, is a stimulus. If an animal has had the opportunity to learn to remain relaxed in the presence of that stimulus (to habituate) the stimulus will be one that, for that specific animal, maintains a state of emotional neutrality. Alternatively, if the stimulus initiates any form of emotional response (whether positive or negative in its nature), the stimulus becomes a stressor. As the majority of domestic dogs live in close proximity to human owners in a socially and physically rich and diverse environment, exposure to stressors is an inevitable part of the domestic dog's life. However, the impact of these stressors can be severely detrimental to both the emotional and physical welfare of the dog. These welfare infringements can place considerable constraints on the affected dog's behavioural repertoire and its capacity to behave in a manner that is consistent with an owner's and the general public's expectations. Such failures to meet behavioural expectations is a common factor in requests for the relinquishment and euthanasia of dogs. A previous article provided a general discussion on stress in companion animals; this article examines the prevalence, recognition, avoidance and resolution of stress in dogs.",

Fur ther suppose that I was deeply committed to this project, both intellectu ally and emotionally, and found it difficult to imagine life without it; the project was not merely something I chose but something I was—it partly constituted my identity. Under such circumstances, should I be given any special treatment? Specifically, should I be entitled to a greater than normal share of social resources to support my project? On one standard reading of liberalism, I should not be. Insofar as lib eralism is committed to neutrality toward (justice-respecting) concep tions of the good life, my share of resources should not vary with my plan of life and the particular ends and preferences associated with it, as liberal principles of justice properly take no notice of such variations— be they across persons or with respect to a single person across time— but rather focus on the development and exercise of those common moral powers (viz., rationality and reasonableness) that characterize free and equal citizens.1 In brief, I should adjust my plan of life to accord with my just share of social resources, not the other way around.

      "title": "The Kantian Formula of Human Dignity and its Implications for Bioethics",
      "abstract": "In bioethical discussions one often finds arguments resting on the notion of the dignity of the human person. It is, for example, said that the human person may not be treated as a mere means, an instrument or an object. The idea of dignity seems to be of great importance especially with respect to the problems surrounding the taking of lives. But the conclusions drawn from this idea are by no means unanimous. One would expect that capital punishment is at least prima facie excluded by the idea of human dignity. But Kant, to whom we owe perhaps the most important explication of this idea, held that respect for the dignity of the murderer demands exactly this kind of punishment. Another perhaps surprising example dates back to 1954 when a Catholic moral theologian objected against the donation of an organ from a living donor in the following way [1]: The human being was created for himself (propter se seu propter suam propriam perfectionem). Man is not a mere utilis, he was not created for the well-being of another creature (not ordinatus ad bonum seu utilitatem alius creaturae). Whoever donates an organ as a living donor, treats himself as a mere res utilis in the service of his neighbour. We may have an idea of what it means to treat our neighbour as means, as utilis, but the idea of treating oneself as a means sounds inappropriate. One modern philosopher seems to feel the same difficulty when, dealing with the Kantian formula, he makes the following reservation [2]: Note that I have eliminated any reference to 'mistreating in one's own person'; for I do not see how anyone can treat himself as a mere means. According to the Kantian formula (second formula of the Categorical Imperative), which tries to explicate the idea of human dignity, should never be treated as a mere means, but also as an end. The application of this formula is not easy. It may appear even more difficult if one looks at Kant's own application of his formula to questions of applied ethics in his Metaphysics of Morals (a book very rarely commented upon) [3]. For a correct understanding of the idea of human dignity and for its correct application in questions of applied ethics one has to look for the correct interpretation of the Kantian formula [4]. This can be done by answering the following three questions: 1. What is humanity (Menschheit) which has to be treated as an end in itself? 2. How is it possible to treat not only other persons as means, but also oneself or correctly in one's own person? 3. What does it mean to treat not only as a means?",

      "abstract": "This article concerns contemporary philosophical discussions of death. The philosophy of death attempts to determine what it is for people and other living things to die and to be mortal, how and the extent to which death, mortality, and posthumous events benefit or harm those who die, and the morality of killing. The issues that arise might loosely be classified as metaphysical, prudential, and moral. The metaphysical issues concern what death is, how it and mortality are related, and, by extension, what it is to be alive, what you and I are, and what the persistence conditions of living creatures are. (The former issues are covered under Nature of Death and Mortality, while the latter are covered under Life and Persistence over Time.) The prudential issues concern how and the extent to which death, mortality, posthumous events, and coming to be affect the welfare of those who die (covered under Mortal Harm and Posthumous Harm), and the time when those effects are incurred (covered under the Timing Issue). Finally, the moral issues concern how the prudential significance of death and posthumous events bear on the moral permissibility of killing. When killing is wrong, it is wrong primarily (even if not exclusively) because of the way death affects its victims. Its objectionableness may be due to the fact that it harms its victims or, in the case of some victims, such as moral agents, because killing them (without their informed consent) is inconsistent with the respect they are due. Philosophers of death attempt to work out whether and how the harmfulness of dying and consent to being killed bear on the wrongness of killing. (These moral issues are covered under Killing.)",

Secretion is a physiologic process, and consists in the elaboration from the blood, or other sources, of material which is discharged on the external or internal surfaces of the body. The material so separated and discharged is a secretion. Many of the secretions have special uses, which do not involve their discharge from the body. Others have no office to perform, but are separated from the blood to be discharged from the body; such may be termed excretions. Most secretions in a healthy body consist of certain well-known combinations, but when these combinations vary, or when new materials enter into their construction, the secretion may be considered abnormal.

It is the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm others; it is not the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm no one but ourselves. In Mill’s classic formulation: the sole end from which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.... The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over him self, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.",

These behaviours give evidence to the explicit hypothesis of the other as distinct from the self, and also as the source of intentionalities and abilities (needs, desires, plans, rationality). From these meanings, listening implies thinking. We can then represent it either in terms of procedures (how to create, obtain, establish, maintain, optimize, show the accurate attitude) – these procedures then become techniques, tools or methods – or in terms of process (what do we feel through such psychic moves ?) The processes develop in a temporality which provides their slow elaboration and maturation in obeying a more biological than mechanical future, whereas the procedures are more elaborate, rational, technical, modelized and segmented, thus more spatialized. The former are ways of acting, the latter are ways of existing. Of course these forms of representation seem heterogeneous, translating very different ways of seeing the world and very different philosophies. They can even claim to be antagonistic, which roughly corresponds to the classical distinction between Homo faber and Homo sapiens. The former is, at least partly, a matter for comprehension, in our acceptation of Dilthey’s terms, whereas the latter is a matter for explanation. The subtle intelligibility of the notion of listening is linked to the distinction between, as well as the contrasted articulation of the two heterogeneous readings.",

The overt, antisocial act may be precipitated by anything which, symbolically or actually, seems to intensify the above factors. Aggression is most intense toward individuals who can either gratify or frustrate basic needs, i.e. family and friends.

This, in turn, leads to an aporia or difficulty: ‘this being supposed, it seems to some a very great difficulty, how any one should ever come to have a Property in any thing’. Locke sets himself to solve this difficulty of individuating the common gift within the constraints of each man's right to it: ‘I shall endeavour to shew, how Men might come to have a property in several parts of that which God gave to Mankind in common’.",

      "abstract": "The recognition of nonrigid motion, particularly that arising from human movement (and by extension from the locomotory activity of animals) has typically made use of high-level parametric models representing the various body parts (legs, arms, trunk, head, etc.) and their connections to each other. Such model-based recognition has been successful in some cases; however, the methods are often difficult to apply to real-world scenes, and are severely limited in their generalizability. The first problem arises from the difficulty of acquiring and tracking the requisite model parts, usually specific joints such as knees, elbows or ankles. This generally requires some prior high-level understanding and segmentation of the scene, or initialization by a human operator. The second problem is due to the fact that the human model is not much good for dogs or birds; for each new type of motion, a new model must be hand-crafted. In this paper, we show that the recognition of human or animal locomotion, and, in fact, any repetitive activity, can be done using low-level, non-parametric representations. Such an approach has the advantage that the same underlying representation is used for all examples, and no individual tailoring of models or prior scene understanding is required. We show in particular that repetitive motion is such a strong cue that the moving actor can be segmented, normalized spatially and temporally, and recognized by matching against a spatio-temporal template of motion features. We have implemented a real-time system that can recognize and classify repetitive motion activities in normal gray-scale image sequences. Results on a number of real-world sequences are described.",

Extrinsic final value, which accrues to things (or persons) in virtue of their relational rather than internal features, cannot be traced back to the intrinsic value of states that involve these things together with their relations. On the contrary, such states, insofar as they are valuable at all, derive their value from the things involved. The endeavour to reduce thing-values to state-values is largely motivated by a mistaken belief that appropriate responses to value must consist in preferring and/or promoting. A pluralist approach to value analysis obviates the need for reduction: the final value of a thing or person can be given an independent interpretation in terms of the appropriate thing- or person-oriented responses: admiration, love, respect, protection, care, cherishing, etc.",

Those who did traditional treatments believe that because of their culture which forms the society’s behavior to entrust healing through traditional treatment. For the people of Desa Tutut Arjowinangun Malang, Pengobatan tradisional is a socio-cultural treatment or treatment based on culture. Pengobatan Tradisional here uses a dream interpretation that can only be done by the healer or shaman Pengobatan Tradisional. The solution of the pain suffered by the patient is derived from a dukun’s dream interpretation and combined with the ritual of giving salt to the patient. The ability of healers, shamans, or healers to carry out traditional medical practices is not obtained by chance or by accident, but by a certain stage or ritual. A healer or dukun has the ability to carry out his traditional treatment practices also through the possession of heirlooms. They are like kris and or ancient weapons in the past, stone, jewelry, and so on. These heritage objects are believed to give a power to perform a ritual both for treatment and other activities that can not be done by most humans. In addition to some of the explanations that have been outlined above, traditional medicine still has a place in the Society due to the support of the surrounding community. The village community of Tutut Arjowinangun gives trust to the dukun Pengobatan Tradisional to provide an alternative for healing. The community of Desa Tutut Arjowinangun Malang has different perception about illness. The majority of Tutut Arjowinangun Malang Village people interprete medical illness as a disturbance of the body’s metabolic system. But the people of Desa Tutut Arjowinangun Malang who still adhere to cultural values will certainly have different perception on the pain. As Foster points out that a personalistic system is a system in which illness is caused by the intervention of an active agent, an active agent here being a supernatural being. These supernatural beings are like supernatural beings or gods, non-human beings such as ghosts, ancestral spirits or evil spirits as well as human beings in the form of sorcerers or sorcerers. So here the sick person is the victim, the object of aggression or punishment specifically directed to him for special reasons concerning him alone.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In New Comedy, a bride is presumed to be a virgin at the time of marriage (or, more accurately, at the time of her first marriage); if she has been violated, it is by the man who is destined to become her husband. A courtesan, on the contrary, has relations with several men, and this renders her ineligible as a conjugal partner. For the courtesan, more¬ over, love is a business, and whatever the romantic feelings that may occasionally be attributed to her, her relationships with men are in the first instance commercial. This is the basis for the common characterization of the hetaera as greedy. Marriage stands outside such mercantile transactions. Far from being acquisitive, the marriageable woman seems almost to be devoid of motives altogether. She is the object of another’s desire, and it is she who is transferred from one party to another in the conjugal transaction. The courtesan engages as an agent in the sphere of economic circulation, selling the use of herself to a purchaser, while the bride is passively given, along with a dowry, by her father or nearest male relative to the authority of her husband.",

      "abstract": "Generics are statements such as ‘dogs are mammals’, ‘a tiger is striped’, ‘the dodo is extinct’, ‘ducks lay eggs’ and ‘mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus’. Generic statements express general claims about kinds, rather than claims about particular individuals. Unlike other general statements such as ‘all dogs are mammals’ or ‘most tigers are striped’, generics do not involve the use of explicit quantifiers (such as ‘all’ or ‘most’ in these examples). In English, generics can be expressed using a variety of syntactic forms: bare plurals (e.g. ‘ducks lay eggs’), indefinite singulars (e.g. ‘a tiger is striped’) and definite singulars (‘the dog is a mammal’). (Sometimes, habitual statements such as ‘Mary smokes’ or ‘John runs in the park’ are classified as generics, but we will not follow this practice here.) The truth conditions of generics have proved quite puzzling for theorists. For example, ‘dogs are mammals’ seems to require for its truth that all (possible) dogs be mammals. ‘A tiger is striped’ or ‘ravens are black’, however, are somewhat more forgiving, since they are compatible with the existence of a few stripeless albino tigers, and white albino ravens. ‘Ducks lay eggs’ and ‘a lion has a mane’ are more forgiving still; these generics are true even though it is only the mature members of one gender which possess the relevant properties. This truth-conditional laxity is limited in scope, however: we do not accept ‘ducks are female’ or ‘lions are male’, even though every egg-laying duck is a female duck, and similarly mutatis mutandis for maned lions. Finally, we accept ‘mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus’, even though fewer than 1 per cent of mosquitoes carry the virus, while also rejecting ‘books are paperbacks’, when over 80 per cent of books are paperbacks. The correct analysis of the truth conditions for generics is a matter of great controversy among theorists working on the problem.",

      "title": "ANATOMICAL STUDY OF PRUSHTHAGATA MARMA W.S.R. TO AMSA MARMA",
      "abstract": "Background: Marmas 1 are the most sensitive &amp; vital areas in our body. which, if injured lead to pain, deformity &amp; even death occurs immediately or sometimes later. Sushruta samhita gives detail description of marmas, mainly in the chapter-six of Sharirsthana, Pratyeka Marma Nirdesh Sharir. Acharya Sushruta, has mentioned one hundred &amp; seven marmas in our body, which further divided into five classes depending upon their structure, such as mamsa, sira, snayu, asthi and sandhi marma. There are 27 Snayu Marmas. Amsa 2 marma is one among them. The shoulder joint is most mobile joint in the body The shoulder injuries like rotator cuff tear, Frozen shoulder, dislocation of shoulder etc are common now a days. For example, the group of muscles and tendons in the shoulder is known as the rotator3 or musculotendinous cuff. The trauma or injury to roatator cuff shows immobility of shoulder (Bahustabdhata).So we can say that trauma or injury to the region of amsa marma shows above said lakshana. Materials &amp; Methods: This is the literary study &amp; References and data about Amsa marma is collected from various Ayurvedic and modern texts. From Brihatrayis and Laghutrayis and other classical books Results: The study for Amsa marma is done with the help of both Ayurvedic and Modern texts. By this study, Predominantly the structures falling under the shoulder and scapular region are mostly affected due to trauma to Amsa marma. It is finally observed that the main structures found at this region are ligaments of Acromioclavicular &amp; glenohumeral joint, Trapezius muscle, Rotator cuff &amp; spine of scapula.",

      "abstract": "Maria Frick, Combining physical actions and verbal announcements as \"What I'm doing\" combinations in everyday conversation Frick's paper examines a particular type of announcement in spoken interaction, one in which a speaker verbalizes what they are about to do next.These announcements are accompanied/followed by the speaker's executing the announced action.Therefore, they are said to form an 'action combination': clausal verbal announcement + physical action, constituting a \"What I'm doing\" combination.This type of action combination is an initial (i.e., non-responsive) but not an initiating action, as it does not make a response conditionally relevant.It is distinct from an informing (and is thus not epistemically driven), and also distinct from a directive (thus is not deontically driven).It is appropriate when participants are about to do something that departs from a social norm: break out of a group unilaterally, leave the room, take more than one's share of food, use a boarding-house reach to help oneself at the dinner table, etc.The paper thus makes an original contribution to the understanding of (one kind of) announcement and its use in everyday Finnish conversation, while at the same time pointing to a hitherto unexplored action combination.It demonstrates that declarative clauses are combined with simultaneous or following physical actions within the social action of treating the physical action as accountable and as a departure from social norms.6. Anna Vatanen, Delayed completions of unfinished turns: On the phenomenon and its boundaries Vatanen's article concerns delayed completions, cases in which a response starts before a clause-sized turn has reached a transition-relevance place and in which the initiating speaker cuts off but, after hearing some part of the response, subsequently completes her turn.Vatanen examines the grammatical, prosodic, and embodied resources used by speakers to 27",

      "abstract": "This is a  re-examination of the history of the origin of the universe as recorded in the Bible and an attempt to find out if God actually created man on the 6 th day, if not, which day did he create man. There is also the question as to when God actually completed his work of creation and whether there were different phases involved in the process of creation. The research method used is a case study of the creation of the universe, life, man, plants and animals and an analysis of records in the Bible. Findings are, that there were three phases in the process of creation and that the process did not come to an end on the 6 th day as the process continued on a day after the 7 th day on which God rested. The work also found that there were three other days of creation aside the first 6 days and are referred to as days 8, 9 and 10 bringing the total days of creation to 9 not 6.This work asserts that man was not created or did not come into existence on the sixth day.The main conclusions are that God did not create man on the 6 th day because the decision to create man on the 6 th day was only a pronouncement of a plan of action that was executed on the 8 th day and that the plan also included that of creating the woman. Since man was not created or did not come into existence on the 6 th day, the process of creation did not end on that day but continued on day 8 in which the man was formed and came into being. Also the creative work of God came to an end after forming the woman called Eve and establishing the marriage institution. Consequently, the process can be said to have been completed on day 10, the day the woman was created. That there were three phases in the process of creation and three other days of creation apart from days 1-6 which are days 8, 9 and 10.

To take the first horn of this dilemma is to claim that God can of his free choice make any action obligatory or non-obligatory (or make it obligatory not to do some action).

But there is also an objective perfection, a life which, by its obligations and the activities it entails, of its nature requires a high degree of perfection; and where such a life is embraced by a solemn and perpetual obligation, it places a person in a state of perfection. While the Spirit breathes where it wills, and the subjective degree of love of God depends chiefly on individual grace, the objective means of perfection (namely, good works which, so to say, compel the exercise of a high degree of love of God and other virtues which accompany it) can be studied as a pattern of perfection, and organised as a means of perfection.",

Good environments are the ones that allow people to step back, relax and feel secure, while engaging in interesting and meaningful activity. Bad environments don’t allow respite: they keep people on their toes and somehow magnify meaninglessness and hollow rules and unreasonable demands. They may also be bleak and even unfair or outright scary. But don’t expect everyone to notice the bad environments: recent studies demonstrate that patients with psychosis are far more likely to notice even subtle negative features in the environment than people without symptoms. The same patients are also less likely to notice the good things an environment has to offer – but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be provided.",

      "title": "Spirituality and psycho-physiological health",
      "abstract": "Spirituality is a sacred aspect of human life that refers to the quality of being concerned with religion specially, for those having faith in God. Having faith in God bears a very broad meaning that whatever happens in this universe is through the command of Allah and Allah has power to do anything what He wants without seeking any help of material or immaterial entities and powers. Such belief in God strengthen human being to cope with all sorts of situations or circumstances through their spiritual power. Therefore, psycho- physiological health can also be improved and maintained by strengthening human spirituality to keep away all sorts of evils coming in the way of one's life. In view of such assertion, the present paper was aimed to deliberate the aspect of psycho-physiological health as a function of spiritualistic belief and behavior. It is, indeed, true that spirituality has always been a guiding and directing sacred force to keep oneself psycho-physiologically healthy. In fact, spiritual bent of mind and behavior is most likely to help human being for alleviating from all psycho-physiologically sufferings. Spirituality is a state of holy way of believing and behaving which is governed by high order religiosity, especially those believing in oneness of God (Allah). The phenomenon of spirituality is something which can never be measured but the aspect of spirituality can only be seen or observed which is reflected from the life of religiously spiritual people. Moreover, it is also important to stress on the fact that a spiritual person is so humble in his behavior while interacting with people that he/she never pose his/her religious power and practices because such people have high intensity of fear of Allah and simultaneously also have high level of hope to get forgiveness from Him. Here, it is important to highlight that fear and hope from Allah is the most important bent of mind which seems to be instrumental in governing psycho-behavioral functioning of a spiritual person. Spirituality- being belief in the oneness of God, shapes the psycho-physical personality of a spiritual person in such a fashion in which both Quranic teaching and the prophet's life are reflected. On the basis of Quran and Hadees, if one lives the life then it is most likely that the person may be away from psycho-physiological sufferings. In this regard it can be firmly advocated that even if some psycho-physiological problems occur then these may be overcome by adopting the means of dua, sadqa and khairat but in the circumstances of high intensity of illness, one should also use medicine and/or meet to the doctor because it is also witnessed from the life of our prophet (S.A.W). However, in quest for combating illnesses, both practices be followed simultaneously by an spiritual person because one does not know that which is effective one or both combined together are functionally becoming instrumental for relieving from disease. The belief in the will of God is the basis of spirituality.In the light of the above, the present deliberation will highlight the qualities of a spiritual person which, in turn, may protect him from the diseases of both psycho-physiological nature. It is imperative to mention here that when life tends to over by the command of Allah, then thereafter no worldly means, either spirituality or material resource can save human-being and this is one of the signs of the existence of Allah who is the creator of what is there in the universe and all that matters, happens on Allah's will. The paper will exhaustively discuss spirituality and its various contributing components for minimizing the pains of illnesses as well as sometimes completely eradicating even the symptoms of psycho-physiological diseases as spirituality is very effective for coping with psychological sufferings but physiological sufferings can also be controlled and eradicated by spirituality as well.",

If one means helping behavior, or helping in order to gain subtle self-benefits such as esteem enhancement or guilt avoidance—which is what most behavioral and social scientists mean by altruism—the existence of altruism cannot be doubted. But these definitions trivialize the centuries old egoism-altruism debate. Only by adhering to the notions of altruism and egoism that lie at the heart of that debate do we face head on the fundamental issues it raises about human potential and human nature. The question of the existence of altruism is, at heart, about valuing. Are we humans ever, in any degree capable of valuing the welfare of another, or is our capacity to value limited to our own welfare? It seems we do have the capacity to value another’s welfare.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Toward the end of the last chapter, I argued that domination threatens individuality. Anyone who endures the (nearly) unlimited power of another—be it a husband, an “oriental despot,” or a popular majority—is robbed of the capacity for self-authorship. I argued that this theft can take several forms: the powerless can be coerced outright or intimidated into conformity and obedience, or they can constrain themselves out of fear. Worse still, they can be socialized and manipulated into welcoming the conditions of their subjection. A well-designed democracy is, for Mill, a means of limiting and dividing power and thereby emancipating individuals from these several forms of domination. I also suggested, however, that individuality was something more than an ideal of equality or non-domination. It has other, more positive elements. Conformity, though sometimes a consequence of domination, is, in other cases, simply a matter of habit or comfort. In fact, Mill holds that it is the human intellect’s natural point of repose. To succeed in living deliberately is to succeed, therefore, in overcoming some of the habits of mind that come easiest. In this chapter, I explore Mill’s account of the demands that individuality places on individuals. I focus especially on Mill’s conception of the “active mind,” which he thinks an integral part of individuality.",

      "title": "Beyond Ergonomics: Evolving to Achieve Fewer Back Injuries in the Future?",
      "abstract": "Painful, disabled backs from tissue damage do not just happen, nor are they caused by psychosocial issues. Nearly all injury mechanisms are linked to joint motion and posture patterns. For example, posture determines which tissue is damaged and at which load (magnitude, duration, frequency, load rate etc). In the case of disc herniation, repeated joint flexion appears to be a necessary condition. Even with an “ergonomically correct” or well designed job, some will still experience pain or injury. This is because so much of the loading experienced by joints is generated not by external loads, but by the muscles themselves. People use different strategies to activate muscles and move through motion patterns. Thus, the way that they choose to move plays a large role in determining their risk of injury. While Ergonomics is important, it is only a component in a broader effort needed to achieve minimal injury rates. In many cases, ergonomic approaches involving job design are impractical or do not address the injury mechanisms that form the root cause of disabled backs. Entire sectors of the workforce cannot use job design (such as law enforcement, forestry, farming, fishing, to name a few). Evidence suggests that an approach to address the cause rather than the symptoms must look beyond ergonomics and consider changing the individual. Successful reduction of back injury rates in the future will have to consider “changing the person to fit the task”.",

      "abstract": "The experience of emotion is a fundamental part of human conscious ness. Think, for example, of how different our conscious lives would be without such experiences as joy, anger, fear, disgust, pity, anxiety, and embarrassment. It is uncontroversial that these experiences typically have an intentional content. Anger, for example, is normally directed at someone or something. One may feel angry at one's stock broker for providing bad advice or angry with the cleaning lady for dropping the vase. But it is not uncontroversial that emotional experiences are always intentional. John Searle, for example, remarks, Many conscious states are not Intentional, e.g., a sudden sense of elation ... (1983, p. 2). Moreover, many animals experience emotions and it is natural to suppose that such emotions lack the sophistication of beliefs or thoughts. When a dog experiences delight in seeing its master after an absence of several days, the suggestion that at least part of the dog's experience of delight is a belief (or thought) that its master has returned home seems to import into the experience something that at best is associated with it and perhaps is not really a state to which the dog is subject at all. And even in the case of human beings, emotional experience often does not seem to involve thought. Consider the experience of disgust, to take one obvious example.' Nor is a salient belief required. One may have a strong fear of spiders and yet not believe that spiders typically pose any risk to humans. But if emotional experiences need not involve beliefs or thoughts, then just how are they intentional?2 Recent theories of consciousness have not devoted as much attention to the",

      "title": "Plagiarism and Plunder: Fabrication and Falsification",
      "abstract": "\"You, who are on the road Must have a code that you can live by And so, become yourself Because the past is just a good bye\"1 The recent dismissal of charges of plagiarism made against no less than a Justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of the Philippines2 and subsequent retaliatory threats against protesting faculty of the College of Law of the University of the Philippines3 are matters of grave concern in a country where even the capital crime of plunder can be so blatantly disregarded. Not surprisingly, these misdemeanors share a similar etymology. Plagiarism comes from the \"Latin plagiarius 'kidnapper, seducer, plunderer,' used in the sense of 'literary thief' by Martial, from plagium 'kidnapping,' from plaga 'snare, net.'\"4 According to the World Association of Medical Editors, \"plagiarism is the use of others' published and unpublished ideas or words (or other intellectual property) without attribution or permission, and presenting them as new and original rather than derived from an existing source.\"5 Just as ignorance of the law is not an excuse to violate it, the misconduct of plagiarism is not contingent on whether it was committed intentionally or unintentionally. Technical Plagiarism \"occurs when one inadvertently fails to properly cite, credit, and/or integrate a source, be it text, computer code, graphic, audio, or video information into one's work … (and) can range in severity from an errant footnote, to incomplete citation information to \"forgetting\" to cite altogether.\"6 Five general types of plagiarism have been identified by Barnbaum:7 \"cut and paste,\" \"word-switch,\" \"style,\" \"metaphor,\" and \"idea.\" The first two are easy to understand, the first referring to literally lifting and applying words, phrases, sentences or paragraphs while the second involves substituting words or paraphrasing without attribution. But even following the flow of thought or reasoning style of another, substituting your own words sentence after sentence or paragraph after paragraph is \"style plagiarism\" and the same holds true when the metaphors or ideas of another are used without proper acknowledgement.7 The bottom line is that plagiarism gives the false impression that the words, ideas, composition or creation are those of the plagiarizer and not someone else's, or misleads the recipient about the nature of the plagiarized material.5 There is even \"self-plagiarism,\" which \"refers to the practice of an author using portions of their previous writings on the same topic in another of their publications, without specifically citing it formally in quotes,\"5 and may give the impression that the present work is new and original, when in fact it is not. According to Scanlon,8 while the whole issue of self-plagiarism \"raises knotty conceptual, legal, ethical, and theoretical questions … we do and should give writers legal and ethical latitude for limited self-copying, although certainly not for egregious duplication.\" Barring situational concessions for limited self- and technical plagiarism in exceptional contexts, plagiarism generally involves fabrication and falsification, which in science (as in law) are misconducts of the highest degree, regardless of the presence or absence of \"malicious intent.\" The Code of Conduct and Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors of The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) outlines the duties of editors in pursuing such misconduct: 9 Pursuing misconduct Editors have a duty to act if they suspect misconduct. This duty extends to both published and unpublished papers. Editors should not simply reject papers that raise concerns about possible misconduct. They are ethically obliged to pursue alleged cases. Editors should first seek a response from those accused. If they are not satisfied with the response, they should ask the relevant employers or some appropriate body (perhaps a regulatory body) to investigate. Editors should follow the COPE flowcharts where applicable (link to flowcharts). Editors should make all reasonable efforts to ensure that a proper investigation is conducted; if this does not happen, Editors should make all reasonable attempts to persist in obtaining a resolution to the problem. This is an onerous but important duty. If this \"onerous but important duty\" applies to scientific misconduct, how much more to an institution whose very foundations are based on ethics and morality and whose raison d'etre is their upholding? Where resides this institution's moral authority, if it cannot set the example it ought to? It is not right to take what is not yours without permission; that is thievery at best. It is even worse to shamelessly appropriate for yourself, that which belongs to others; that is looting and piracy. But the large-scale wanton stripping of intellectual (and other) properties and subsequent justification with legalese that violate the very roots of academic (and other) freedoms for present and future generations are tantamount to no less than pillage and plunder.",

      "title": "Sensitivity to Shame in Greek and Roman Epic, with Particular Reference to Claudian and Nonnus",
      "abstract": "English shame and German scham derive from the Gothic schama , ‘to hide, cover, conceal’. German Hemd (shirt) and English and French chemise are other derivatives. In some languages the word for ‘shame’ and the word for ‘wound’ are the same. A wound exposes and can thereby advertise vulnerabilty and a cause for shame. Hiding or covering may seek to guard against wounding, humiliating exposure. Shame is self-evidently an important human emotion. Insofar as animals are innocent of shame, experience of it is a mark of humanity. Much human behaviour is influenced by fear of shame and embarrassment. Living in the face and eyes, shame is very close to the experienced self. Self-image and self-esteem are heavily determined by one's susceptibility to shame. Experience of shame is impossible without a sense of individuation, without a sense of discreteness from the world and of being an object in the eyes of another. Study of shame sensitivity therefore offers many clues to an individual's or a culture's behaviour, sense of identity and relationship to the environment.",

      "title": "De gevel – een intermediair element tussen buiten en binnen: Over het tonen en vertonen van het twintigste-eeuwse woongebouw in Nederland",
      "abstract": "This study is based on the fact that all people have a basic need for protection from other people (and animals) as well as from the elements (the exterior climate). People need a space in which they can withdraw from the rest of the world. The two states, inside and outside, public and private, contact with, or isolation from, the outside world, are relevant in fulfilling this basic need. People also want their home to have a certain appearance or status which they can identify with and which they can present to the outside world. This can also often be derived from the façade. The façade which is on a side which can be seen by the general public can be seen by the most people. Protection and appearance/status are two important characteristics of the façade. The term social filtering is used in this study to mean protection and face or mask to mean appearance/status. The means which can be used for protection embrace a broad spectrum, of which a fence, the doorstep (threshold), the door and shutters are just some initial examples. The means which can be used to lend status to a house are just as diverse. It is impossible to make a strict distinction between the means of social filtering and those of the face or mask and they often fulfil both functions. The façade as social filter and as face or mask of the residential building is the starting point of this study. Both the roles, as social filter and face of the home, have undergone great change as a consequence of the accommodation of several homes in the one building. The history of homes in the Netherlands shows that the individual house has only been one of many dwelling possibilities since the nineteenth century ; the ‘stacking’ of homes on top of each other in larger buildings, described as residential building, became a necessity in the cities. This is why this study is focussed on the residential building and its façade in the city in the Netherlands. Two questions formed the starting point for this study: 1. How can information about the need for contact or isolation, and the need for status, be read from the exterior of a house? 2. What happens to the face and the social filter of a building when we no longer look at it as a house for just one social unit but as a residential building which accommodates several homes? The two questions resulted in an investigation into the aspects by which the social filter and the face of a façade can be read. Residential buildings designed as such to meet the demand in cities began to appear more often in the second half of the nineteenth century. Initially, they were cheap and hardly innovative. By the start of the twentieth century, the entrance to homes in the residential building, an important element of the social filter, had become a subject of study for architects and various solutions were developed. The appearance of the residential building showed, on the one hand, pragmatic approaches, but on the other, architects tried to develop a face or mask for this relatively new type of building. Throughout the twentieth century, the period covered by this study, the residential building and its façade have undergone great change. This change reflects the cultural, social, technical and economic factors which have had an effect on the design of the residential building and the significance of the façade with its social filter and its face or mask. Today, the façade of the residential building has reached a freedom which reflects the possibilities, the architect’s creative expression and the client’s commercial needs. The façade hardly contributes to the communication between life outside and the resident and his or her home inside. Social filtering, which often takes place in a dynamic way between the exterior and the interior, is still important, but now takes place to a large degree behind the façade. The face shown is neutral, if not anonymous, and hides the number of homes behind the screen. In order to follow the changes in the residential building and its façade through the twentieth century and to understand with what means architects have developed the façade in particular, the research question has been formulated as: What factors and architectonic means have been decisive in the Netherlands in the twentieth century for the façade of the residential building as an intermediary element (as face/mask and social filter) between the exterior and the interior? The aim of this study is to learn more about the factors which lead to the decisions about the design of a façade and to understand the architectonic means which are applied to make a façade readable. This study also has the aim of providing an analytical approach to looking at a façade and making a contribution to the design of buildings and a broader study of the relationship between buildings and their façades. The study is organised in a theoretical framework and the analysis of ten projects. The theoretical framework in respect of façade, face and mask (chapter 4), a historical context of residential construction (chapter 5), a context of the development of public, exterior living (chapter 6), and private, interior living (chapter 7) are included in the theoretical framework. The analysis of the ten projects is presented in chapter 8. The framework and the analysis form one whole. The analysis of the case studies demanded a method which would illustrate the façade as social filter and face or mask. In order to make the role of social filter more comprehensible, the transition from the public space in front of the main entrance to the entrance to the home has been illustrated by means of two isometric drawings. The public space of the steps from the doorstep or pavement to the private home is also documented in a diagram, and the architectonic resources which make up this transition are recorded with photos. For the analysis of the façade as a face, the parts of the human face which are easily included visually are used metaphorically. The eyes are openings, the mouth is an entrance or door, the nose is a vertical feature, the head shape of the face is the most easily read form of the building and the profile supports the information because it shows depth. Visually striking aspects of the face which protrude, recede, frame or divide can be translated in the façade as, for example, bay windows, balconies, beams, framing lintels or windowsills. Visually distinguishing lines of profiles can be seen in the form of balconies or, for instance, a switch in material. In order to use the metaphor of the human face as the foundation for an analysis in architecture, an analytical framework has been assembled. The Gestalt laws, applied to buildings by Niels Prak, demonstrate how we visually perceive the built environment. The head shape and horizontal and vertical parts and sections are perceived faster than free forms or a complex picture with a lot of different information. These laws justify the choice of the subjects for analysis which have been drawn in a reduced form. The subjects for analysis for the façade as face are: the head shape, the profile, the openings for light and for the entrance (door), visible constructional elements in the façade (horizontal and vertical), decorative parts, protruding and receding parts, material and colour. In the analysis, the sociocultural background of the project will be described, summarised as building assignment, and all the architectonic aspects will be shown which make up the social filter and appearance, summarised as building form. Façade definitions (chapter 4) The term façade means the vertical exterior of the building, just as the face practically vertical is. The roof is governed by its own principles and is not always a part of the façade unless it can be seen. The horizontal roof, like the crown of a head, cannot easily be seen. The term façade carries several meanings. The façade is something that is presented to its surroundings and that is why it is often associated with the face. The term façade (Latin facies = face) makes the connection with the metaphor of the face clear: the façade of the building is meant to be the presentable side which is shown to the public. The human face communicates non-verbally by means of expression. The façade does not have this movement and can only be called a face metaphorically. The façade can still show what happens behind it to a degree, however, what the building is for, for example. The façade can also exhibit an idea or represent an illusion; the façade is then a mask. The term garment is used for both the protective and aesthetic role of the façade. A garment keeps you warm and protects, but it can also be decorative and the status of the person wearing it can be clear if the code included in the decoration is understood. The façade therefore also fulfils this role as the conveyor of information. The degree to which the façade has a filter role is determined by the degree to which it allows things to pass though it: light, air and temperature but also people and animals. This ability to allow things to pass through it is dynamically regulated depending on the means used. Depending on the building’s spatial configuration, there may also be a front façade, rear façade or side façade. The historic context of the residential building (chapter 5) The urban house changed almost imperceptibly until the nineteenth century into a building which accommodated several homes. The construction of the residential building designed as such intensified in the second half of the century, however, when the increasing demand for housing meant that it was necessary to provide more options. The ‘stacking’ of homes in such a building meant another means of entering the building. The immediate entrance to the home increasingly withdrew from the street and communal entrances and stairwells appeared. The most important change from the individual house to the shared building was the entrance. Architects often lent expression the communal entrance, perhaps to help the resident and visitor become more familiar with its new communal aspect. Various changes to the residential building and its façade can be seen throughout the twentieth century. While architects like Hendrik P. Berlage and his followers in the first two decades enriched the façade with details and news ideas for communal entrances arose, functionalists like Willem van Tijen designed residential buildings in the thirties and during the post-war reconstruction which showed what their function was without any embellishment. Architects reacted to social, economic and technical factors. Where the first residential buildings consisted of six to eight homes per staircase per floor, the introduction of galleries and then, in the fifties, the lift, meant that many more homes could be accommodated. This was particularly the case in the sixties after the first wave of post-war reconstruction. The residential buildings were so big that it was barely possible to see the whole form. They were also a product of mass production. The seventies, with the focus on individuality and consultation, saw the production of homes shift towards small-scale neighbourhoods with façades which made small groups of homes readable. The last two decades of the twentieth century were characterised by more sober façades and larger residential buildings. The façades project neutrality and the anonymity of living in the town or city. The diversity of the façades and the choice of material have increased dramatically and are also used to express the luxury of living in the city. The façade and the public (chapter 6) The gradual transition from street to house in the town or city in the Netherlands has been present for centuries. The border between the two was vague, people worked both in front of, and in the house. An important change for living in the town or city was the disappearance of city walls and gates after 1874 as a consequence of the vestigingswet [‘Settlement Act’], which allowed non-residents into the city or town without checks, and when the front door was established as the border between the public and the private. The façade became a necessary border between the public and the private. The street lost its importance as public space for those living on it as traffic increased. The introduction of the residential building only increased the distance to the street. The anonymization of the street also played a large role throughout the whole of the twentieth century. The functionalists rejected the street and wanted to connect homes with recreation and green spaces. Urban blocks of buildings were opened up as was the layout of residential buildings. This resulted in residential buildings which had several façades which were visible to the public. In the seventies, some architects, like Herman Hertzberger, returned the street to the resident and a pedestrian friendly zone in front of homes (the woonerf) was created. The house façades on the residential areas allowed openness and space to be seen, fusing the public and the private. This approach was quickly followed by a reintroduction of a distance to the street. The last two decades of the twentieth century were characterised by a withdrawal of the social filter role to behind the façade. The street’s role as part of the home can only be found in very protected environments. The façade and private living (chapter 7) Private living was initially led by an increasing embarrassment and hygiene. The need to retreat further into the house gave rise to a more differentiated layout even in the traditional house and this can be read from the façade. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the privacy of the home was lost when it was housed with several others in the one building and by the internal entrance in a relatively open landing on the upper floors. The first two decades of the twentieth century saw various entrances which made privacy possible such as the entrance stairwell and the gallery. The homes received their own front doors with a hall behind them. At subsistence level, privacy was reduced to a very small space and this would only change after the Second World War; regulations for minimum surface areas in the fifties contributed to this. Economic growth in the sixties and seventies allowed a need for individual development and private space within the family. Increasing preferences for homes resulted in a greater diversity but also in neutral houses which could be adapted. The façade reflects this. Privacy at the end of the twentieth century meant freedom of choice. The residential building showed the consideration for this freedom in a neutral façade. The case studies (chapter 8) The case studies reflect the various phases of the changes in the residential building and its façade. The ten projects chosen can be found in the Dutch town or city and have all been designed as homes. The projects chosen are: 1914 – The Hague portico Copernicuslaan, Den Haag, architect unknown 1911-15 – Dwellings in the Indische Buurt, Amsterdam, architect H.P. Berlage 1918-22 – Justus van Effen Complex, Rotterdam, architect M. Brinkman 1925–26 – Residential building Oldenhoeck, Amsterdam, architect P.A. Warners 1932–34 – Bergpolder Flat, Rotterdam, architect W. van Tijen 1955-58 – Dwellings Pendrecht IV, Rotterdam, architects J. en L. de Jonge 1962-68 – Dwellings Het Breed, Amsterdam, architect F. van Gool 1969–76 – Dwellings Molenvliet, Papendrecht, architect F. van der Werff 1978–82 – Dwellings Haarlemmer Houttuinen, Amsterdam, architect H. Hertzberger 1994–98 – City block De Landtong, Rotterdam, architect CIE, F. van Dongen The first two cases just have six to eight homes per staircase per floor and their entrances are richly decorated while the Justus van Effencomplex and, in the sixties, Het Breed project with a gallery bring many more homes together and their entrances are less expressively designed. At the end of the twentieth century, the Landtong connects the homes visually with each other by means of an internal corridor with a void allowing the other floors to be seen. The expression of the collective and the individual through the century is very different; the home cannot always be read from the façade. Conclusion The most important conclusion from this research is that the social filter between the public and the private today often lies behind the screens, so that the transition between the public space and the façade is less gradual and the expressiveness of the façade is different and achieved by other means. The façade is more of a mask to protect the anonymous home than a face that exhibits it. The line between a façade as a face or a mask is not always clear, however, because the perspective of the person looking at it can change. A façade can create an illusion in the distance, but show the home from close by.This study demonstrates the development of the residential building and its façade in the Netherlands with the focus on their development in the twentieth century. The relationship of the façade with the immediate public space surrounding the home and the relationship of the façade with the private home have been important starting points for this study. It places the façade as an important element in protecting the home and as well as an expression of it. The study demonstrates a way of looking at the façade which is very important for design decisions for new construction but also for maintenance and conservation.",

This denoted individuals who were in possession of eyes capable of casting spells, causing harm to others or damage to material objects, whether intentionally or not. An angry or jealous look spawned an evil angel and it was this angel that wreaked the damage attributed to the evil eye. In order not to cast a glance that might have magical consequences, one should turn one's gaze to heaven. Every sudden indisposition was attributed to the influence of the evil eye. Symptoms which were a sure sign that one had fallen victim to it were a high temperature, headache, yawning, stretching, and drowsiness, but the list was an open one, and could also include various types of swelling, convulsions, vomiting, or accidents such as bone fractures or sprains. The power of the evil eye came not so much from otherworldly sources as from the free will — or lack thereof — of the person inflicting it. Verbal attempts would be made to redirect the attention of the evil eye onto other objects, while guests and even people met on the street would be issued with warnings not to 'inflict the eye', to 'look at the lamp', or to 'count nine chimneys', otherwise their 'eyes would end up on the fifth house from here'. A considerable range of common apotropaics was in widespread use in traditional society.",

      "title": "Effects of postnatal light environment on the development of the mouse stress system",
      "abstract": "The postnatal period is a critical time for development where external influences can help shape the long-term structure and function of the brain. Adverse experiences or stressors during the postnatal period, such as abuse or neglect, can have huge consequences on the long term function, health and susceptibility to disease. One environmental factor, whose importance is becoming increasingly more recognised for normal development, is light. Abnormal light during the first three weeks of life has been shown to have long term effects on the circadian system of rodents. On the other hand, the effects of abnormal light during the postnatal period on the stress system have yet been relatively unexplored. Therefore the aim of this thesis was to assess if altered postnatal light environment, such as that a preterm baby might be exposed to, has any long-term effects on the stress system.Mice were raised under constant light (LL), constant darkness (DD) or a normal 12:12hr light:dark cycle (LD) for the first three weeks of life from postnatal day (P)1 up until P21. From P21, all mice were then housed in LD conditions and the stress system was assessed by looking at several different levels of the HPA axis including neuropeptide expression in the brain, body and adrenal weight, and plasma corticosterone levels under both basal and stressed conditions. Learning and memory, anxiety-like behaviour and circadian output rhythms were also evaluated. Finally, mother-pup behaviour and maternal HPA axis were assessed to see if maternal care was changed by altered postnatal light.Both LL and DD rearing caused changes in the HPA axis of offspring with LL raised mice showing alterations in neuropeptide and glucocorticoid receptor expression in the brain. Postnatal DD resulted in a blunted corticosterone response to a stressor in females but had no effect in males. In terms of behaviour, LL raised mice had increased depressive-like behaviour. In contrast, postnatal light appears to have no effect on learning and memory or anxiety behaviour. When we looked at circadian output rhythms, we found that LL rearing appears to confer resilience to the rhythm disrupting effects of LL later on in life as seen by the maintenance of locomotor activity, body temperature and plasma corticosterone rhythms in LL. Maternal care and maternal stress systems appeared unaltered under the different postnatal light environments suggesting that the changes we see in the offspring are attributed to mechanisms other than alterations in maternal care.",

      "abstract": "Ahara and Vihara play very important role in getting these Prayojana. The crucial role of Ahara and Vihara is maintenance of Dhatus i.e., Dhatusamya, by which all physiological activity remain proper e.g. Dahana, Pachana, Chaya-Upachaya Kriya, etc. By Vihara the fitness and constitutional arrangement of body remain well, Jatharagni gets improved and Bala as well Vyadhikshamatva also gets improved. Acharya Charaka says “Aharah Praninam Pranah” and Acharya Sushruta says “Praninam Punarmoolam Aharo Balavarna Ojasam Cha” that is the Ahara is the life of all the Pranis as well as base of Bala, Varna and Oja i.e., life is impossible without Ahara. Thus, Ahara and Vihara are useful for prevention of diseases. Ayurveda also frequently referred as 'Ashtanga Ayurveda' and Rasayana Chikitsa are the part of the Ashtanga Ayurveda. It helps a person to maintain good health or to establish impaired or lost physical or mental health. Rasayana Chikitsa are said to revitalize all the Sapta Dhatus (body elements), therefore, restores equilibrium and health.",

      "abstract": "Discusses two psychopathological phenomena of the Malay culture, Amok and Lattah. Amok refers to the horrific, unexpected, murderous attack in the tropical rest of the kampong (village). Lattah refers to the note gaie in the daily contact between a family and its household staff. It is contended that study of these psychic abnormalities is of great interest because of their specific nature and symptoms (showing some characteristic qualities of the Malay race) and because a deeper insight into those psychic aberrations of primitive people, having a less complicated psychic structure, is of great value to the study of the psychoses of cultured races. Amok is considered an acute, mostly infectious delirium, while the peculiar psychic nature of the Malay is responsible for the symptoms which render this syndrome entirely different from similar ones in Europe. The symptoms of Lattah are described as in consequence of a fright or some other sudden emotion; the startled patient screams, after which she repeats everything that is said, called out or done in front of her (echolally and echopraxis); besides she does everything she is told to do, including actions entirely adverse to her habits and inclinations (automatism by command). These compulsory symptoms can be kept up as long as one wishes by using the element of fright again and again; they disappear as soon as the patient is spoken to quietly and soothed.

In addition to accepting the obvious permissibility of killing microbes and plants (except when this is objectionable for either instrumental or impersonal reasons), most people believe that it can be permissible in a variety of circumstances to kill animals, and also that it can be permissible to kill other human beings in self‐defense and in appropriate conditions in war. There are four distinct categories into which we may sort most or all instances of killing for which there may be a reasonable justification. Perhaps the most contentious category consists of cases in which killing would simply promote the greater good—for example, a case in which killing one person would prevent the killing, or the deaths, of a much greater...",

The Al-Qur'an explains in detail and sequentially that the glorification of human dignity occurs in several phases. The first is before his existence on earth (unseen world): when Allah wants to make a human caliph (ruler) on earth, he orders the angels to prostrate to Adam as a respect, excellence, exaltation and knowledge are taught as a whole. Second, when in the womb where the fetus is well cared for and is well cared for by getting nutritious food through the placenta. Third, when he is in the world, he is given a perfect body shape, makes it easy for him to control the land and sea, is given the right to manage the world and everything in it, is given good sustenance, and is honored by other creations of Allah SWT. Fourth, be glorified at the time of death, at funerals, and after death. To maintain and protect the dignity of human beings, Allah has prepared three important components for humans as a basis for protecting human rights (HAM), namely faith, law, and morals. The method used in interpretation related to this research is the thematic method or maudui 'which is combined with qualitative methods as a basis for library research, Al-Qur'an verses, hadith syarif, journals, articles, seminars, and conference proceedings.",

      "title": "Habunallah [Allah is Sufficient for Us]",
      "abstract": "There is much stress in the Holy Qur’an and Sunnah to remember Allah in all affairs of human life. Remembrance leads a human (he or she) to reflection and thinking, to restrain and advance, to plan and perform. The Holy Qur’an and Sunnah have used various wording for expression of Remembrance of Allah. In this paper we will study and examine only one such phrase which is Hasbunallah and means Allah suffices us. The objective is to create self confidence that every human being is the creation of God and has been gifted with all such faculties which were necessary for him or her according to the will of his or her Maker and that the more a person will remember Allah the more this belief will be established in his or her mind and heart and he or she will feel as if God is always with him or her and has not left him or her unattended or non responding to his or her call. Allah alone is the Creator of all of you while you all belong to Allah alone being the creation of Allah alone. This knowledge brings in the skill how to use the favours of Allah on humanity. It also generates attitude to perform it in the best possible manner with full sense of accountability. Obedience and following comes when one become fully aware that nothing is futile in this universe and there is a role for everyone to play in the right, positive and constructive direction and dimension in open and secret and that rights and obligations are there which are to be recognized, respected and honoured by way of paying and discharging honestly and punctually keeping the intention good throughout. Human rights are fundamental and those are for all. Thanks giving is not a word of art. It is meaningful and purposeful. Similarly the words Habunallah are meaningful and purposeful. Let us survey the whole of the Holy Qur’an to see what guidance is available in this Divinely revealed Book of Guidance.",

      "title": "The Loss of Identity Through Abuse in Toni Morrison’s Beloved.",
      "abstract": "Whilst it is estimated that domestic violence can occur in one quarter of all marriages,[1] it can vary in form, perpetrator, and victim. This form of abuse is often wrongly perceived as purely violence from a man directed towards a woman, often his wife, or as any behaviour by a parent that results in injury to a child.[2] This is also the case in literature, including Toni Morrison’s Beloved. Often not the primary focus of novels, and not always occurring in the stereotypical sense of physical violence between man and woman, it often goes unnoticed or misunderstood, despite being vitally important to the plot of the texts. There is often a change in self that the characters undergo that is caused by the domestic oppression that they are battling. Throughout the course of the abuse, whether mental or physical, the oppressed loses sight of themselves and their true identity. Victims often change to resemble a person that the perpetrator wishes for them to become, just as Sethe’s identity is altered by Beloved. Only when the oppression is defeated, whether that be by fight or flight, can the victim’s identity be reclaimed. The exploration of the patterns of Beloved’s abuse of Sethe, in comparison to those of real domestic abuse reveals, shows how Sethe loses her identity.\r\n \r\n[1] Olivia Salcido, ‘Immigrant Women and Domestic Violence: Common Experiences in Different Countries’, Gender and Society, 16.6 (2002), 898 – 920 [31/10/17] (p. 899).\r\n[2] James Garbarino, Understanding Abusive Families, (Lexington: D C Heath, 1980), p. 5.",

      "abstract": "[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 144(4) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: General (see record 2015-33206-002). In the article the labels on the X-axis of Figure 1 \"Remove Variance\" and \"Preserve Variance\" should be switched.] Symbolic material objects such as art or certain artifacts (e.g., fine pottery, jewelry) share one common element: The combination of generating an expression, and the materialization of this expression in the object. This explains why people place a much greater value on handmade over machine-made objects, and originals over duplicates. We show that this mechanism occurs when a material object's symbolic property is salient and when the creator (artist or craftsman) is perceived to have agency control over the 1-to-1 materialized expression in the object. Coactivation of these 2 factors causes the object to be perceived as having high value because it is seen as the embodied representation of the creator's unique personal expression. In 6 experiments, subjects rated objects in various object categories, which varied on the type of object property (symbolic, functional, aesthetic), the production procedure (handmade, machine-made, analog, digital) and the origin of the symbolic information (person or software). The studies showed that the proposed mechanism applies to symbolic, but not to functional or aesthetic material objects. Furthermore, they show that this specific form of symbolic object valuation could not be explained by various other related psychological theories (e.g., uniqueness, scarcity, physical touching, creative performance). Our research provides a universal framework that identifies a core mechanism for explaining judgments of value for one of our most uniquely human symbolic object categories.",

      "abstract": "The need to fight that emerged with the rise of mankind led man to invent appropriate devices to gain advantages in their struggle against various animals and natural forces first, and then against fellow creatures, for one of the most important requirements of surpassing in a fight is weapons and equipment. Thus, weapon can be defined simply as “the devices developed by man in order to defend themselves against the nature and the enemies.” As the product of maintaining self-existence and struggle for this scope, weapon is a natural feature for animals and plants. Special features of animals like trunk or teeth of elephant, horns of bull, quill of hedgehog or of plants like the leaves of the Venus flytrap can be seen as the weapons being used by them in order to survive. In fact, man seems to be inspired by these features of animals and plants in the first place whilst producing the first weapons. Man, always seeking facilitative and reassuring tools in order to overcome the difficulties exceeding his physical power, first have used natural materials such as stone, bones and wood, but soon tried to imitate the natural weapons of animals and plants. Poisoned arrows in the size of hedgehog spines used by primitive tribes, wild animal traps resembling the Venus flytrap, battering-rams used to shake down gates of medieval castles etc. are the most obvious examples of this inspiration. It is very hard to determine where and when the Turks used the technology of siege engines first time. The stereotype opinion in that topic is that, as a nation having nomadic life, Turks kept away from siege engines that slowed down nomadic life and limited freedom of activity because of production, carrying and usage these weapons. Really the sources giving information about early Turkish history did not say anything about siege methods and weapons which the Turks used. However, it is known that Turks had political, military and commercial relations with China that was the center of the technology of siege engines and as a consequence of relations, there had been a process of civilized and cultural interaction between the two societies. It is certain that this interaction was experienced intensively in the area of the technology of war. So it cannot be thought that Turks were not aware of the technology of siege engines developing in China. Moreover, it is seen that Turkish states which were founded outside the Central Asia used artillery weapons and siege engines when needed during their advances into Europe and Middle East. In this regard it can be said that Turks had a great role in transferring of the technology of siege engines developing in China towards Europe and Middle East. Because Turks had left Central Asia and advanced towards west and shaped the political, social and cultural character of Europe and Middle East by setting up political organizations. In this study we will evaluate the interest of Turks in the technology of siege engines and their role in transferring of the technology between the East and the West.",

The biblical background can be found in Exodus 13,2, where The Lord speaks to Moses: \"Declare the first-born of man and beast to be holy to God\". This Commandment is discussed at length in the Talmud, where two references to unnatural delivery are to be found. The first, how to evaluate a live, or dead, foetus that is found during the ritual slaughter of a healthy animal, or on the emergency slaughter of a fatally injured animal, that has to be cut out by incisions through the abdominal wall and the uterus (cf.

      "title": "Symbolic Environment and Liking",
      "abstract": "George C. Homans (1950) has set forth an assumption about the relation between interaction and liking: the frequency of interaction between two or more persons increases, the degree of their liking for one another will increase, and vice versa. (p. 112). After some criticism concerning the generality of the assumption, he has added that the thesis is valid only when the interaction is not forced (1961, p. 186-187). This reasonably means that if one of the actors in the interaction sequence dislikes one of the others, the thesis is not assumed to be generally valid. Homans has shown in a somewhat convincing manner that this thesis is reasonable and can be supported by different kinds of empirical data. From this it follows that: (1) If A likes B (and B does not dislike A), then A and B will interact. By interaction or communication we mean every action performed in a social situation. The concept interaction is a central one in what Homans means by group, namely: . . a number of persons who communicate with one another often over a span a time, and who are few enough so that each person is able to communicate with all the others, not at secondhand, through other people, but face-to-face (1950, p. 1). From this definition and (1) it follows that: (2) If A and B interact then A and B belong to the same group. This is true only provided that A and B do not meet by chance at some isolated times and are temporary acquaintances. Now let us introduce Torgny T. Segerstedt's concept of symbolic environment, which can be defined in the following way: the symbolic environment is the meaning the words (the verbal symbols) have for a person. By meaning we imply here the object to which the word is knitted, the behaviour which is associated with the word, and the emotion which is associated with the word.",

I have seen more than one man who owed his entire usefulness and justification for existence to a neurosis which put an end to all the stupidities which were dominating his life and forced him into an existence which developed the truly valuable qualities which would have been choked out if the neurosis with its iron talons had not taken the fellow and plunked him down in the place where he belonged. There are men who have in their unconscious the true meaning of their lives and in the conscious that which is for them error and seduction. With others it is just the reverse. In the one case the neurosis means a thoroughgoing reduction or regression, in the other not at all.",

      "abstract": "As an artist, Gerd Rothmann is concerned with the human body. He has been investigating it and experimenting with it for more than thirty years: the fruits of his labours are finger and foot casts. Jewellery must, if it is actually to be worn, observe specific conventions. Here the possibilities of creating something very particular, personal, incomparable are, therefore, limited to a certain extent. Rothmann introduced body casts in the medium of jewellery early on in his career by clothing finger casts in objectively abstract smooth forms or recasting moulds of some parts of the body as small sculptures. In doing so, Rothmann creates objects that, on the one hand, are the most intimate adornment of a particular body, that is, jewellery in its most beautiful, direct form, and, on the other, can be viewed as free-standing sculptural figurations. The upshot is artworks that are entirely individualised. What might be taken for granted (for example, fingerprints) is defamiliarised and reproduced as abstract and ornamental. Cold precious metals seem to have been bent into human shapes because they have been 'touched' by body heat. The contrast is stirring to see. Rothmann represents a stringently radical interpretation of jewellery, which is always commensurate with wearability and the highest quality.",

      "title": "Woven Words, Embroidered Stories: Inscriptions On Textiles",
      "abstract": "Textiles are of great importance both for the aristocratic courtly culture as well as for the clerical culture of the Middle Ages because they are usually used to mark and shape a visual border between the inside and outside.1 Stone, metal, glass and wood are also used for the purpose of marking and shaping a visual border.Compared to these materials, however, textiles excel in this capacity because they are flexible and can be produced and designed in a variety of ways.What they do less well is protect the interior from external violence or unwanted access.2There are three specific properties and functions of textiles, which are also relevant for inscriptions on the textiles: 1. Flexibility: On the one hand, textiles are locomobile, i. e. a cloth, a dress, a tent can easily be moved from one place to another as a whole.On the other hand, they are also elastic, i. e. they adapt to the interior they create or encase.Therefore, textiles are typically used to cover movable objects such as human or animal bodies (clothing, horse blankets, etc.) or to create ephemeral interiors (tents).2. Drawing a line: Textiles do not create limits that are insurmountable, but primarily borders that restrict a person's vision.In most cases (tents, clothes, curtains, wrapping), this creates an interior protected from the eyes of those standing outside.In reverse, a special interior space can also be conceived and imagined when the border to the outside is highlighted by textile boundaries (tapestries).3. Symbolicity: The textiles that draw these boundaries have surfaces that are particularly suitable for making symbolic statements, either by the material design of the surfaces (colours, use of special threads made of wool, silk, gold, etc.) or by the application of signs of any kind (images, texts).3The semantics of colours and precious fabrics (silk, brocade, velvet, etc.) and ornamentation through woven or dyed patterns or fabric combinations are particularly popular in chasubles and clothes worn by the nobility.1 Cf. the exemplary studies in Coatsworth/Owen-Crocker 2018 and the survey in Heller 2017.Naturally, textiles are also required to protect from environmental factors (cold, wind, the sun, rain etc.).As this aspect does not play a prominent role for script-bearing textiles, it will be disregarded in this chapter.2 Cf.",

      "title": "Sellars to Solomon, 28 June 1976",
      "abstract": "Abstract In this letter to David Solomon, Sellars is exploring some of the logical implications of both ascriptions and expressions of we-intentions. We can ascribe both intentions and actions to groups, but neither ascription formally entails the corresponding intention or action for any particular member of that group. If, on the other hand, I express a group intention (“We shall disperse”), this doesn’t formally entail “I shall disperse”; but it does have some implication of the form “I shall do A”—at a minimum, “I shall not impede the dispersal.” Sellars emphasizes that we-intentions need not be shared—the point is merely that such intentions are shareable. The categorically valid intention defining the moral community is, “We shall any of us do that which (in his/her circumstances) promotes (maximizes) our common good.” Sharing this intention defines what it is to be a member of the moral community.",

It suggests that there <italic>is</italic><italic>indeed</italic> a third role for us in relation to symbolism besides being an object of symbolic manipulations or a manipulator of objects through symbols—a unique mode of <italic>symbol-making</italic> (or symbol-revision) emergent in the harmonized interstices between our inner and outer realities.

      "abstract": "At the University of Toronto, we’re embarking on a bold new initiative to bring together these four disciplines: law, business, engineering, and medicine, through what we call “sousveillant systems”—grassroots systems of “bottom up” facilitation of cross-, trans-, inter-, meta-, and anti-disciplinarity, or, more importantly, cross-, trans-, and inter-passionary efforts. Passion is a better master than discipline (to paraphrase Albert Einstein’s “Love is a better master than duty”). Our aim is not to eliminate “big science,” “big data,” and “big watching” (surveillance), but to complement these things with a balancing force. There will still be “ladder climbers,” but we aim to balance these entities and individuals with those who embody the “integrity of authenticity” and to provide a complete picture that is otherwise a half-truth when only the “big” end is present. This generalizes the notion of “open source,” where each instance of a system (e.g., computer operating system) contains or can contain its own seeds (e.g., source code). Sousveillant systems are an alternative to the otherwise sterile world of closed-source, specialist silos that are not auditable by end-users (i.e., are only auditable by authorities from “above”).",

In this definition, mimicry is closely related to mimesis or the practice of representation in literature, performance, and the visual arts. Yet in contrast to mimesis, which often seeks to reproduce an image of the object that is being copied, mimicry can have a humorous and even subversive potential that deliberately sets out to challenge the meaning of the object that is being copied or represented. This is not to say that the act or practice of imitation is restricted to literature and the visual arts, however, since the imitation of other human beings is also one of the formative processes through which children learn to speak, act, and perform as socialized human subjects. Furthermore, in biology, the practice of mimicry denotes the close external resemblance of an animal or plant to another, or to an inanimate object (OED) , in some instances as a tactic of self‐defense.",

      "abstract": "DUNS SCOTUS ON THE WILL* (I made them) . . . . . . authors to themselves in all, Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formed them free, and free they must remain TUl they enthrall themselves. Milton, Paradise Lost, III 122—25 For Duns Scotus, the wiU has no example or analogue in the rest of nature. He takes it to be an elementary, simple self-activity, not derivable from anything else, and distinct from every sort of activity that is not the wiU. Its distinctive characteristic is its complete freedom with respect to action of opposite kinds. Since it is unique, it is not capable of being defined; but anyone can obtain an immediate awareness of the will as free. \"Whoever makes an act of wiU experiences in himself that he can also not wUl.\"1 \"Anyone can experience this in himself: when someone else presents to him something as good and even shows it as a good to be considered and wiUed, he can turn away from it and refuse to elicit any act of wiU towards it.\"8 That such extreme contingency , taken as an example of contingency in general, is underivable from any prior principles can be shown by the following argument: Inference is possible from the less perfect, i. e., the contingent, to the more perfect, i. e., the necessary, but the reverse is not possible. \"Therefore, it cannot be shown by means of some prior and distinct middle term, that being is necessary or contingent, nor could that part of the disjunction that is contingent be demonstrated, given that something is necessary. Thus, the statement 'Something is contingent', appears primarily true and not deductively demonstrable (demonsirdbilis propter quid).\" Scotus concludes at this point with a paraphrase of Avicenna's mUd witticism: \"So, those who deny 'something * A paper read before the Southern Society for Philosophy of Religion, Tallahassee, Florida, 5 March 1953. 1 Q. in Met. IX, q. 15, n. 15. Experitur enim qui vult se posse non velle. 8 Op. Ox. IV, d. 45, q. 10, n. 10. Hoc potest quilibet experiri in se ipso: cum quis offert sibi aliquod bonum, et etiam ostendit bonum ut bonum considerandum et volendum, potest se ab hoc avertere, et nullum actum voluntatis circa hoc elicere. 147 148/. R. CRESSWELL is contingent' ought to be exposed to be tormented, until they admit that it is possible not to be tortured.\"8 \"The wül in the act of willing is an immediate datum ... to demand proof (in this connection) is the mark of an Ul-educated man.\"4 Though the passages on contingency just quoted are concerned with contingent being as such, they obvioulsy provide the basis for his appeal to experience in any attempt to examine the nature of the wUl. Indeed, a chief emphasis in his whole phüosophic exposition is on what is or can be experienced. Let us now proceed to characterize the free will. In the Opus Oxoniense I, dist. 39, article 3, Duns Scotus says that the freedom of our wiU consists of three things: First, the will is free in regard to contrary acts; it can wiU or refrain from wUUng the same objective. Second, the wUl is free in regard to contrary objects; it can tend towards opposite objects. Third, the wiU is free in regard to contrary effects; it can choose among opposite objectives, and to be able to choose thus is to be able to produce opposite effects. Freedom of wül as such is found particularly in the second feature. If this second point is considered, we can see that the wiU can exercise successively two contrary acts. Can it also be true that it has this potentiaUty towards contrary acts simultaneously ? Suppose further that, in this single instant, it exercises a particular voUtion. To aU appearances, its freedom of choice would be exhausted in this single act, so that one could say that the act would fill its whole existence. However, this single voUtion would not be a necessitated one, and here is the proof. If the wül necessarily exercised this voUtion and since it would be a cause only in the single instant...",

Scientifically, therefore, the word ``dignity'' should be a countable noun; you have many concrete dignities, including your body organs, your children, your wealth, your privacy, your image, and so on; in addition, you need to defend these concrete dignities of yours all your life. With this scientific concept of dignity, this paper can smoothly solve a series of hard problems, including (1) how human ancestors stood up from four-legged animals; (2) why humans got dressed; (3) how humans acquired wisdom; (4) why humans commit suicide; and (5) why humans have developed into what you see today.",

      "title": "The Logic of Aesthetic Concepts",
      "abstract": "There are two sorts of descriptions, or accounts, that we can give of works of art or of anything else that makes up our world of relatively stable objects. I can describe a painting, a chair, a mountain, or a man in terms of colors, shapes, spatial relation of parts, and so on. I can also describe the same four objects by talking about the dynamic tensions of the first, or its lack of visual balance; the grace and elegance of the second; the gloominess or majesty of the third; and the trimness or gawkiness of the fourth. The first sort of description, or account, may answer a wide variety of general purposes, central among them that of identifying particular objects. A museum curator might so describe a painting for future reference in identifying the particular work of one painter; an auctioneer identifies pieces of furniture by such descriptions; a map-maker, a mountain; and a police department, a Man Wanted. The second sort of account of the same objects could not usefully serve such purposes. The second sort, usually if not always, is found in the context of the evaluating of objects. This is a fine Sheraton chair-it is but sturdy. Here, relevant reasons are furnished for an rating of an object, and the first sort of description does not, and could not, serve this function. Furthermore, there are the following prima facie differences between the two sorts of features attributed to things in the two sorts of description. The features corresponding to terms like garish, graceful, balanced, seem to require for their apprehension a special sensitivity or training on our part and their presence or absence does not appear to be determinable-at least, not in a straightforward way-by intersubjective tests. (I shall call both features and terms aesthetic and employ A and A, respectively, as short-hand for features and terms.) The features corresponding to terms like red, rectangular, continuous to, seem, in contrast, to require for their apprehension no special sensitivity or training beyond the ordinary and their presence or absence appears'to be determinable by intersubjective tests",

      "abstract": "Both sexes suffer the same stresses in the same professional conditions, and there is not a great deal of difference between men and women in the ways each responds. For the purpose of this outline we are only interested in systems in which the person is operating within a totally hostile, unsurvivable environment, while armoured against it by machinery and equipment. Stress may be regarded as having two sources: that caused by (internal) personal predisposition; and that caused by surrounding conditions and circumstances. A human being functions best under stress. Too little and one becomes comatose. Too much and one panics and either makes gross, possibly fatal, errors, or capitulates and hands over to one's Maker. The way in which the human operator functions has a number of electrical analogies. Under stress, which is always present with work-load, influences intrude which are similar to 'noise'. These may result from other people around and about-from system, structural and mechanical failures occuring simultaneously-from within oneself, through fear and anxiety. The authors focus on human beings subjected to high and low static pressures in air or water and the measurement of stress in these circumstances. (13 pages)",

Among the main points in this article is talk about faith and monotheism, where the statement that Allah has broken His promises is a lie and the accusation that he took a son is an insult. With the Qur’an and hadith as the foundation for breaking every accusation that is thrown to Allah, it is impossible to think that it can be in God’s substance, and when someone can understand it as well, it can have a big impact on their faith and deliver a big love to their only one God. This research was conducted using the qualitative method, which entailed gathering data from various sources, connecting the data, and then using the data as a foundation to deny all lying and amplifying that thrown to Allah and as a foundation that Allah was the truth, and and only God all of time.",

For centuries, Black people have lived under these stereotypes, a “widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing, but which is often not true in reality.”1 The effects of these stereotypes can be damaging physically and psychologically. We are brought into the world with labels. Labels are meant to give meaning or clarity to a person, place, or thing. They define the category or container in which they are to be placed. And with these labels come certain connotations, beliefs, and assumptions. If you are called “lazy” or “worthless” all of your life, after a while, some part of you might start to believe it. If society shows you that your life is not worth as much as your white counterpart, after a while, you start to believe it. When a white man, cloaked in blue, puts his knee on the neck of an unarmed forty-six-year-old Black man and leaves it there for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds without any regard for the value of this Black man’s life, that says something.2 When a Black woman is raped by six white men while walking home and the men are tried twice but never convicted, that says something.3 When the first Black president of the United States witnesses people touting depictions of apes eating bananas as a reflection of him, that says something.4 This way of thinking became the foundation upon which the institution we call the United States was built. As actors, we are taught to step into the shoes of the characters we portray. And with each portrayal, we bring a part of ourselves, our experiences. Those experiences shape our own beliefs, values, and behaviors, as well as our biases, both positive and negative. How can we avoid the traps that come with putting our own labels on the characters we portray? How do we overcome the negative stereotypes that have been passed down from generation to generation? Through investigation and character exploration, actors can dig in and establish the nuances of the characters they portray. As a Black actor, educator, and director, I’ve become familiar with the assumptions, labels, and racial stereotypes applied to me over the years. As an actor, I want to be recognized for my work as an “artist” in the industry. As an educator, I do not want my students of color to portray [End Page 111] the one-dimensional characters we have seen throughout history, thus perpetuating the negative stereotypes. As a director, I want actors to realize their full potential and worth and not let these negative stereotypes stifle their freedom of expression and creativity. When I hear the phrase, “I don’t see color,” my response is usually, “Really?” This phrase is counterproductive, because when you don’t see my color, you don’t see me. “See” that I am Black; just don’t treat me differently because I am Black. Let us unpack this a little more. Two labels are assigned to us at birth: our race and our gender. These are our identifiers. Based on these two identifiers, society begins to make assumptions. As we go through life, those labels become subject to stereotypes. It is up to us whether these stereotypes become part of our identity, in a process identified by developmental psychologist Erik Erikson as “identity formation.” He theorized that there are eight stages of development from infancy to adulthood; depending on the disturbances, traumas, and other experiences an individual encounters, an identity crisis can result from confusions and wars within the self.5 The more we learn to associate ourselves with the encouraging labels (creative, curious, honest) instead...",

      "abstract": "From an early age, humans intuitively expect physical objects to obey core principles, including continuity (objects follow spatiotemporally continuous paths) and solidity (two solid objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time). These two principles are sometimes viewed as deriving from a single overarching “persistence” principle. Indeed, violations of solidity where one solid object seemingly passes through another could theoretically be interpreted as a violation of continuity, with an object “teleporting” to switch places rather than passing through a solid obstacle. However, it is an empirical issue whether the two principles are processed distinctly or identically to one another. Here, adult participants tracked objects during dynamic events in a novel location detection task, which sometimes involved violations of the principles of continuity or solidity. While participants explicitly noticed both types of violations and reported being equally surprised at both, they made more errors and answered more slowly after continuity violations than after solidity violations. Our results demonstrate that the two principles show different signature patterns, and are thus represented distinctly in the mind.",

I have also attempted to explain the origin or development of these actions through the three principles given in the first chapter. The first of these principles is, that movements which are serviceable in gratifying some desire, or in relieving some sensation, if often repeated, become so habitual that they are performed, whether or not of any service, whenever the same desire or sensation is felt, even in a very weak degree. Our second principle is that of antithesis. The habit of voluntarily performing opposite movements under opposite impulses has become firmly established in us by the practice of our whole lives. Hence, if certain actions have been regularly performed, in accordance with our first principle, under a certain frame of mind, there will be a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of directly opposite actions, whether or not these are of any use, under the excitement of an opposite frame of mind.",

      "abstract": "What Is the Emotional Plague? A plague implies a highly contagious disease that can become epidemic (rapidly widespread) or pandemic (an epidemic throughout many countries). The Black Death, a fourteenth century plague, connotes an epidemic characterized by the person’s skin turning black; Bubonic Plague by the sufferer developing buboes or swellings. So the emotional plague is characterized by infectious, destructive emotional reactions, and like other plagues may be crippling and deadly. The emotional plague is driven by an intolerance of spontaneous life, emotions, and pleasure (Reich 1949, pages 248-280). Wilhelm Reich’s colleague, Dr. Elsworth Baker, stated, “We can say that to the degree that an individual tries to tear down other people or control their lives, he is functioning as a plague character” (Baker 1967, page 154). Someone afflicted with the emotional plague just cannot leave someone else alone. Where does the energy for this reaction come from? This destructive behavior starts with just one person who is a catalyst. That afflicted individual is compelled to stifle or destroy those people or things in the environment that stir up unbearable feelings. These feelings include unfulfilled longings and desires that in turn result in intolerable anxiety, frustration and eventually murderous rage toward those who stir them up. This compulsion to destroy, serving as an emotional defense for that individual, is the essence of the emotional plague. When one person’s irrational intolerance and destructiveness incite others to act destructively, we know for certain we are dealing with the emotional plague. Unfortunately, the potential for that",

      "abstract": "“Mind to Mind”:Tolkien’s Faërian Drama and the Middle English Sir Orfeo1 Kelley M. Wickham-Crowley (bio) Now “Faërian Drama”—those plays, which according to abundant records the elves have often presented to men—can produce Fantasy with a realism and immediacy beyond the compass of any human mechanism. As a result their usual effect (upon a man) is to go beyond Secondary Belief. If you are present at a Faërian drama you yourself are, or think that you are, bodily inside its Secondary World. The experience may be very similar to Dreaming and has (it would seem) sometimes (by men) been confounded with it. But [in Faërian Drama you are in a dream that some other mind is weaving, and] the knowledge of that alarming fact may slip from your grasp. …2 You are deluded—whether that is the intention of the elves (always or at any time) is another question. They at any rate are not themselves deluded. This is for them a form of Art, and distinct from Wizardry or Magic, properly so called. They do not live in it, though they can, perhaps, afford to spend more time at it than human artists can. The Primary World, Reality, of elves and men is the same, if differently valued and perceived. (OFS 63, ¶74) … faierie a state of being in which the will can more or less directly cause things imagined or desired actually to be, or can at least present them to the senses; and the very immediacy of the operation enhances the quality of the product: beautiful things produced by faierie retain the beauty of the vision that precedes the making … (OFS 255) Between every two trees is a doorway to a new world. (Attributed to John Muir)3 J.R.R. Tolkien’s foundational theories of “On Fairy-stories” include the coining of the term “eucatastrophe,” the definition of subcreation, a term first implied by George MacDonald4 though without the expansion Tolkien gave it, and the concept of Secondary Belief in a created Secondary World. But another phrase, Faërian drama, has gone mainly undiscussed as a literary term except in some of Verlyn Flieger’s work,5 perhaps for obvious reasons. It appears as a somewhat peculiar [End Page 1] reference to what fairies/elves might create as art but becomes a springboard for philosophical and metaphysical considerations of how two created species with inherently different minds might communicate what is most central to their experience of the world. On one level, “On Fairy-stories” is a manifesto, as Verlyn Flieger has rightly called it (“Fairy-tale” 27). It does not simply attempt to discuss the terms, rules, and history of what are commonly called fairy tales; it declares Fantasy the highest form of human literary art because, motivated by a desire to be closer to the original creator of worlds, it attempts in its subcreated worlds to imitate that maker. It offers reasons why the desire to tell a story that gives us new ways to see the world, that turns unexpectedly to joy, is central to any being and its health, but even more, central to the created world and its purpose. Within an essay with such a sweeping context for human art, then, Faërian drama initially seems paradoxically important and a minor aside. Tolkien invites us to acknowledge that “fairy-stories” are really human stories about Faërie and its immortals, and asserts that Faërie in its own art would consider humans and mortality as similarly puzzling and alien. Both bodies of stories would inevitably be partial and sometimes in error, constrained by the minds and natures of each. Of what use then, perhaps especially in an academic essay, is an imagined art and genre for an equally imagined or even nonexistent race of artists? The key here is Tolkien’s refusal to separate his scholarly and intellectual interests from his urge, as a created being, to create fiction and fictional settings that command credibility. He had to work out the metaphysical possibilities of Faërie art, constituted by him here under the term “Faërian drama,” to create his own...",

      "title": "WORTH AN ARM AND A LEG: DISABILITY AND INTIMACY IN THE MAKING OF MADURAI VEERAN",
      "abstract": "Disability discourses in India appear to be intricately intertwined with intimacy. One aspect of this entanglement is apparent in the familiar yet understudied trope of disability as punishment meted out for certain kinds of intimacies, especially those considered to be transgressive for various reasons. Leprosy serves as one instance. Early discourse of leprosy which designates persons affected with leprosy as ritually impure suggests that one of the reasons for being affected by leprosy may be ‘bad actions’ such as sexual transgressions or violation of kinship taboos. T.A.Wise’s colonial commentary on Hindu systems of medicine documents leprosy being attributed to failure in observing prescriptions of abstinence; a man who ‘visits his wife before food is digested’ (Wise, 259) could contract leprosy. Just as in the leprosy case, bodies marked with impairments such as facial disfigurement or limb damage or amputation have been interpreted in terms of the transgression those bodies may have  participated in. Acid attacks on women serve as a contemporary instance of a similar kind, where the retributive facial disfigurement may be perceived as symbolic of spurned love. The Supreme Court of India, invoking a fairly modern notion of disability as a socio response to impairment, recently ruled that acid attack survivors be given the status of disability so that they may benefit from the same socio-economic protections offered to other disabled people in the country. These instances enable us to inquire into what appear to be persistent interconnections between intimacy and disability to find out how each is constituted by the other and under what conditions.",

      "title": "The Tenability of Herman Cohen's Construction of the Self",
      "abstract": "The Tenability of Herman Cohen's Construction of the Self STEVEN S. SCHWARZSCHILD THE PHILOSOPHICAL SEARCH for the self (personal identity, human individuality, per- ~nhood, or whatever else it may be called) has generally been pursued in one of three standard directions: \"the self\" has either been taken as some kind of somatic term, or as some kind of mental term, or finally as some kind of combination of the previous two: All such enterprises have, however, succeeded inadequately at best; it might even be said that they have failed. All one need do is look at the contemporary philosophical disputes revolving around this question--the mutual refutations and counter-refutations--to draw such a conclusion. 2 Still, the need of a philosophical conception of human selfhood is obviously imperative . It should, therefore, be extremely useful to look at an approach to this problem which differs not merely in one detail or another, but in principle, from the three previously mentioned procedures. Here it is argued that \"the self\" designates neither a physical nor a mental phenomenon, nor even a psychosomatic one; that all attempts at justifying this notion along such lines are, therefore, foredoomed to failure; and that in fact the self is an idea in the Kantian sense--a concept, a normative or regulative notion. I shall present this argument and critically compare it with other relevant and current views of the matter, chiefly by summarizing three chapters in Hermann Cohen's Ethik des reinen Willens3 that deal directly with the self, together with some correlative texts: z For example, this triple classification coincides essentially with T. Penelhum's use of \"memory criterion\" and \"bodily criterion\" and a combination of these two in \"Personal Identity,\" Encyclopaedia o/Philosophy, vol. 6, and that of Charles Landesman in \"The New Dualism in the Philosophy of Mind,\" Review o/Metaphysics, XIX (Dec. 1965), 329-33 I. 2 A. J. Ayer says, talking about Hume (Ayer and R. Winch [eds.], British Empirical Philosophers [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1952], p. 28): \"The idea of self as substance is to be discarded not because it is uncommonly difficult to verify in practice but because it is in principle unverifiable.... Of all the problems of philosophy, this is one of the most difficult. But I think it is soluble, although I do not think that it has yet been solved.\" Cf. also Dennis Wrong, \"Identity: Problem and Catch-words,\" Dissent, Sept.-Oct. 1968, and the literature there adduced. s Ethik des reinen Willens (Berlin: Cassirer, 1904); subsequent citations to this text in this section are in parentheses. This work is \"the second part\" of Cohen's \"System of Philosophy.\" The first part is his Logik der reinen Erkenntnis (Berlin: Cassirer, 1902; 2nd ed., 1914). The third is Aesthetik des reinen Ge/uehls (2 vols.; Berlin: Cassirer, 1912). For how his own philosophical construction of the self emerged seamlessly out of his still entirely convincing Kant-exegesis, see particularly \"The Reformulation of the Second Edition: The I,\" Kants Theorie der Er/ahrung (Berlin: Ferdinand Duemmler, 1871), pp. 137-146. This was the fundamental work that put Cohen on the map at the time. On Cohen in general see W. Kinkel, Hermann Cohen: Eine Ein- /uehrung in sein Werk (Stuttgart: Strecker and Schroeder, 1924). For our subject in particular cf. Jacob Gordon, Der Ichbegriff bei Hegel, bei Cohen, und in der Suedwestdeutschen Schule (Berlin : Akademie-Verlag, 1927), and J. Agus, Modern Philosophies o/Judaism (New York: Behr~ man, 1941), esp. pp. 76-82, 96-103, 108-117.

Desire is caused by and directed toward any empirical object or state of affairs, and such object or state of affairs is, of course, found through cognition (or \"thinking\").

      "title": "Freedom of Thought and Mental Integrity: The Moral Requirements for Any Neural Prosthesis",
      "abstract": "There are many kinds of neural prostheses available or being researched today. In most cases they are intended to cure or improve the condition of patients affected by some cerebral deficiency. In other cases, their goal is to provide new means to maintain or improve an individual's normal performance. In all these circumstances, one of the possible risks is that of violating the privacy of brain contents (which partly coincide with mental contents) or of depriving individuals of full control over their thoughts (mental states), as the latter are at least partly detectable by new prosthetic technologies. Given the (ethical) premise that the absolute privacy and integrity of the most relevant part of one's brain data is (one of) the most valuable and inviolable human right(s), I argue that a (technical) principle should guide the design and regulation of new neural prostheses. The premise is justified by the fact that whatever the coercion, the threat or the violence undergone, the person can generally preserve a \"sanctuary of thought\" in which to defend her convictions and identity, her dignity and autonomy. Without it, the person may end up in a state of complete subjection to other individuals. The following functional principle is that neural prostheses should be technically designed and built so as to prevent such outcomes. They should: (a) incorporate systems that can find and signal the unauthorized detection, alteration and diffusion of brain data and brain functioning; (b) be able to stop any unauthorized detection, alteration and diffusion of brain data. This should not only regard individual devices, but act as a general (technical) operating principle shared by all interconnected systems that deal with decoding brain activity and brain functioning.",

As the material self cannot be disentangled from networks that are simultaneously economic, political, cultural, scientific, and substantial, what was once the ostensibly bounded human subject finds herself in a swirling landscape of uncertainty where practices and actions that were once not even remotely ethical or political matters suddenly become so. Trans-corporeality is a new materialist and posthumanist sense of the human as substantially and perpetually interconnected with the flows of substances and the agencies of environments. Activists, as well as everyday practitioners of environmental, environmental health, environmental justice, and climate change movements, work to reveal and reshape the flows of material agencies across regions, environments, animal bodies, and human bodies—even as global capitalism and the medical–industrial complex reassert a more convenient ideology of solidly bounded, individual consumers and benign, discrete products. Even though the recognition of trans-corporeality begins with human bodies in their environments, tracing substantial interchanges renders the human permeable, dissolving stable outlines. Tracing these connections discourages us from taking refuge in the fantasies of transcendence and imperviousness that make environmentalism a merely elective and external enterprise.",

The desire for vainglory consists of persons seeking that human beings praise their good deeds. But the Apostle in Rom. 12:17 commands this of us: “Provide good deeds both in the sight of God and in the sight of all human beings.” Therefore, vainglory is not a sin. Every sin consists of the disorder of a natural appetite.

      "title": "Teatralidad en casa: la arquitectura doméstica y la diva",
      "abstract": "La diva o el divo es una persona publica, un sujeto cuya artistica condicion laboral lo convierte en un ciudadano diferente. La diva no es ni masculina ni femenina, es un hombre, una mujer; todo un personaje cuya personalidad publica se confunde y se funde con sus ser privado. La diva, en terminos arquitectonicos, no presupone una profesion concreta o un genero definido. Se incluyen todas aquellas personas que por su trayectoria y estatus esten envueltas en un halo de excepcionalidad, ficticio o no, merecido o no, que los lleva a esta categoria. Una diva como cliente es otro tipo de sujeto, que no incorpora necesariamente las expectativas y normas tradicionales sobre los papeles dentro del ambito domestico. La diva es aquel o aquella cuyo trabajo es ser otro, interpretando o asumiendo a otros, como los actores o los cantantes de opera, o incluso auto-interpretandose, como en el caso de otro tipo de celebridades. Ser diva es un estado psicologico. Los arquitectos de exito a veces son divos. Su actuacion, entonces, ha de ser siempre original y solo consideran adecuado un marco extraordinario. El estudio de sus viviendas o sus lugares de trabajo es revelador de una concepcion que entiende la casa como una prolongacion de su comportamiento. La tesis alcanza una serie de obras para ilustrar el conce`to de la casa de la diva, comenzando con la vivienda de la actriz Maria Guerrero, ubicada literalmente encima del teatro que en la actualidad lleva su nombre. A continuacion, tres casos permiten, a modo de introduccion, ver la metodologia empleada en la elaboracion de la tesis: las casas-estudios de la pareja diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo, la casa del matrimonio de Dolores del Rio y Cedric Gibbons y, finalmente, la casa de Billy Wilder. Son dos casos distintos a los ejemplos desarrollados con mayor profundidad en los cinco capitulos siguientes: son viviendas de matrimonios compuestos por dos divas. Por ultimo, la casa de Wilder permite el analisis del retrato hollywoodiense mas preciso de la diva, su vivienda y su contraparte en la vida del creador de este retrato. Todas las obras estudiadas, menos el ejemplo de la obra auto-construida por la Guerrero, emplean una arquitectura decididamente moderna dentro de su contexto historico. Manejan una arquitectura que cuestiona la definicion del hogar, la relacion entre espacio publico y espacio privado y reformula la composicion de la casa en su disposicion espacial. En el estudio de las casas ejemplares del as divas en los siguientes capitulos, el orden es cronologico y, salvo la primera, todas datan del siglo XX. La primera obra es el parisino Hotel Guimard, del arquitecto Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, construido en el siglo XVIII. Enlaza la investigacion con el origen de la arquitectura moderna, en el momento historico en que se codifico como disciplina. Las otras cuatro obras se analizan son: la casa para Josephine Baker de 1927 en Paris obra del arquitecto austriaco Adolf Loos; el atico para Charles de Beistegui en los Campos Eliseos de la misma ciudad, de 1930-1931 del suizo Le Corbusier; la casa para Josef Von Stemberg en Los Angeles, California en 1936 del tambien austriaco Richard Neutra y finalmente la Glass House disenada por Philip Johnson para Philip Johnson en New Canaan, Connecticut, construida en 1949. Estos cinco ejemplos siguen diferentes variantes de una arquitectura moderna, cada caso formula el concepto de un espacio domestico donde lo estrictamente privado deja de serlo, donde la cara publica del hogar toma un aspecto desproporcionado con las expectativas de la casa tradicional. Son cinco obras de arquitectos comprometidos con un concepto de modernidad, y permiten una lectura poliedrica que entrelaza una arquitectura que prima la representacion y no solo la funcion. Este analisis explicita la interrelacion entre la personalidad de la diva y la arquitectura dentro de un contexto sociologico y biografico, revelando tando sobre eltemperamento del ocupante como de la significacion de la construccion dentro de la obra del arquitecto. La construccion se nos muestra finalmente como una simbiosis entre personalidades, donde la teatralidad dinamiza y se convierte en signo del hogar.",

      "title": "English Love Divinations Using Plants: An Aspect",
      "abstract": "SOME forms of plant divination would appear to be based on. pure chance in that the diviner has little influence on the outcome, as, for example, with the practice of blowing seeds off a dandelion or pulling petals off a daisy to ascertain the faithfulness of a lover. In other forms this may not necessarily be the case, for there is the possibility, if not the probability, that though they seem on the surface to rely on pure chance or some supernatural event, they can be influenced or deliberately engineered by the participants in order to manipulate a relationship or to legitimize one. From the following examples I hope to illustrate this theory in further detail. Furthermore, because the forms of love divination are so many and so varied, I shall only concentrate on those which take place in the first six months of the year and are associated with festivals or saints' days. Many forms of love divining were associated with particular festivals, and often involved the appearance of the lover in a dream or as a ghost or image. In most cases, undoubtedly, the actions performed during the day or evening, such as sowing seed in a dark churchyard or garden, fasting, or placing objects under the pillow, coupled with the heightened emotions aroused during these actions, would be enough under the circumstances to induce the desired dreams. The supposed appearance of the lover as a ghost, particularly, though not exclusively associated with the hemp seed (Cannabis sativa) divination to be described below, may have in fact been the real person. In most cases, I believe, the girl would probably already know the man, who in turn would reveal his feelings by taking part in the little drama, by raking or mowing the seed thrown by the girl. These actions may be seen as an attempt by the couple to formalize their relationship or give it endorsement by a supposed supernatural occurrence. Some examples will serve to illustrate these points, and I shall begin with those taking place on St. Agnes's Eve (20 January). St. Agnes was the patroness of young girls, and the customs observed on her day relate to divinations formerly carried out almost exclusively by girls. Many forms of divination were practised, but a twenty-four hours' fast beginning on the Eve was a condition precedent to its completion. Another important point was the girl's direct appeal to St. Agnes, which is recorded in some accounts. This direct appeal occurs also in other divinations taking place on a saint's day, as may be observed later in this paper. In northern England and Scotland, for example, until the mid-nineteenth century, girls, and also in this case young men, met together at midnight on St. Agnes's Eve and going to a cornfield threw in handfuls of grain; the girl would then repeat:",

The person is caused to have, or caused to form, such intentions as another wishes him to have. Hence, regardless of how it may 'feel' to him from the inside, from the external point of view people can see that he is not in control, not self-determining.

      "abstract": "Abstract The law concerning liability for injury caused by animals is a compromise between two conflicting interests. The behaviour of animals, however tame, cannot always be controlled and may result in injury to others who are blameless. It is reasonable keep an animal, whether as a pet or for agriculture, and yet it is not reasonable to expect that such animals will be kept so closely confined and controlled as to eliminate all risk of injury to others. With the types of animal commonly kept in Britain, whether as pets or for agriculture, people can be expected to know and to cope with the usual and predictable ways that animals behave. The principles of the law reflect this. Broadly, the keeper of an inherently dangerous animal keeps it at his peril and is strictly liable for any injury that the animal may cause. But the keeper of a domesticated animal is not liable for an injury it may cause unless he has been negligent, or there are special reasons for him to believe that the individual animal might be unusually dangerous.",

Islamic water ethics can be dened as those direct and indirect interactions people have with actualor virtual water resources that are consistent with the teachings of Islam and humans' role on Earth as a khalifah or vicegerent, and masters on Earth, not of Earth [5,6].

      "abstract": "Abstract This book is about permissive consent—the moral tool we use to give another person permission to do what would otherwise be forbidden. For instance, consent to enter my home gives you permission to do what would otherwise be trespass. This transformation is the very thing that philosophers identify as consent—which is why we call it a normative power. It is something individuals can do, by choice, to change the moral or legal world. But what human acts or attitudes render consent? When do coercive threats, offers, or lies undermine the transformative power of consent? What intentions or conventions are necessary to render consent meaningful? This book develops a novel theory that explains the moral features of consent in some of the most central domains of human life—but that also serves as a study in how to theorize normative power. It argues that consent is a moral mechanism with exactly the set of features that, when triggered, prevents another person’s behavior from constituting a certain kind of wrongdoing. What kind of wrongdoing? It depends on what sort of permission is being granted. Sometimes consent permits others to enter, occupy, or act within some bounded domain wherein the consent-giver holds moral authority. In these cases, consent operates to prevent what I call invasive wrongdoing. By identifying the moral features that underlie this special wrongdoing, we can learn what it takes to render consent.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of Erikson’s major concerns about adults was that the mature years of life harbor far too many internal restrictive covenants that are used against the self and others. Adults are “such moral creatures,” he wrote, “that we invariably react to any generalization regarding human behavior … with questions of immediate applicability to conduct.”1 Judging others quickly, adults neglect to ask what human needs they might understand if, on witnessing others’ behavior, they would first try to understand the meaning of such behavior. Instead, they draw conclusions, assign blame, and prescribe remedies. By middle age in particular, superego development has taken its adult as prisoner, leading adults to fear that in their expected-to-be-perfect state, they are far from being as good as they should be, as far as childhood is now distant from the self. As Erikson had illustrated in his prejudice imagery, this leads to self-judgment, to the magnifying of others’ quirks, and to the defensive projection of real or feared flaws onto others. Observed flaws are one’s negative identity; they come from and are deflected backward onto the accusing self.",

In extensions of the concept, however, only one person is concerned in the two facts, or both original agents are replaced by two different ones (as explained shortly). The agents are often individuals, but they can also be groups or institutions of various kinds.

It maintains that the organic paradigm stresses (a) the ideal unity of the whole; (b) internal relations; (c) teleological or dialectical processes; (d) co- or inter-dependent members (e. g. the human body or face); (e) a role-orientation; (f) living functions; (g) freedom defined as doing as you should; and (h) qualitative factors prevail. By contrast, the atomistic model emphasizes (a) the value of individual freedom; (b) external relations; (c) mechanical or causal explanations; (d) separate “parts”(e.g. a machine); (e) a rule orientation; (f) formal, legal, or artificial frameworks; (g) freedom defined as doing as you please; and (h) quantitative factors prevail. The article contends that the sense of individual loneliness or alienation experienced is generally much greater in the atomistic society. And since both the American family and its surrounding society are, in the main, atomisticly-structured, it follows that loneliness is more pronounced and prevalent in American society. The article concludes by offering some programmatic ideals and measures to reverse and mitigate the present tendency toward increasing loneliness in the United States.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on collective moral failures: drastically harmful events stemming not (only) from individual deeds or inaction but (also) from the deed (and/or inaction) of multiple people. They are failures because the events in question could have been prevented. They are collective because their happening depends on a collection of people not intervening or acting otherwise to prevent them. Thus the malignant intentions of a few cannot by themselves account for what has happened: a collective is complicit. Might such events still be designated as 'evil'? I argue that collective moral failure is a definite category, that it has been a condition of the largest-scale atrocities, that such collective moral failures cannot be sufficiently accounted for in terms of the malignant intentions of individuals and that to the extent that the evil characterising large-scale atrocities cannot be reduced to individual intentions, we must be able also to locate evil in social situations, relations, or structures. This does not mean that evil functions as an explanation of such event, but rather that it is something itself to be explained. Thus only a suitably deflationary conception of evil is of relevance in the characterisation of large-scale collective moral failure.",

In response, the Buddha presents a parable in which he asks Malunkyaputta to consider the condition of a man who has been wounded by an arrow and now requires the services of a surgeon in order to save his life. In these circumstances, does the man wish to do all that is possible so that the surgeon may succeed at his task, or does he first wish to resolve his doubts regarding the reasons for his wound? Who shot the arrow? and why? Was the act deliberate or accidental? Was the archer old or young? So many questions to ask!

(1) When an adult identifies with an infant or a child and directs appropriate emotional availability, the affect of dependence and attachment that the adult recognizes in the child is called amae (the prototype of the word). (2) When an adult has little empathy with the dependency or attachment shown by the child, the adult negatively perceives that the child is \"amaeru-ing.\" Experiencing such discommunications, the child begins to test adults to see if they have empathy with him or her. In other words, he or she begins to formulate certain psychological functions linked with amae such as reading other people's expressions—hitomishiri (stranger anxiety) or enryo (hesitation or reserve). (3) When the child is good at actively manipulating the emotions of adults and creates such a state of affect as to satisfy his or her dependence or attachment, he or she is said to be an amaeru-ing child. (4) When the child, although he or she is actually dependent on or loved by adults, denies the fact and behaves innocently or defiantly, the child is said to be in a state of amae. The usage of the word amae described above can be observed in exactly the same manner in interactions between adults.",

      "abstract": "By the term eunuchos, as well as by the terms thladias (a man whose testicles were intentionally crushed), spadon (a eunuch due to natural reasons), and ektomias (a castrated man), which designated different types of eunuchs, the Byzantines identified any male person deprived, fully or in part, of his genitals. This may have occurred in early childhood or at a later age, of his own will, through natural processes, or by the acts of others, and it may have happened for moral, medical, or economic purposes. A eunuch could also be any person who, for natural reasons, a lack of hygiene, or other reasons, had become permanently or temporarily unfit to procreate, or even, in some cases, to sexually perform. These terms also appear in theological contexts to reflect the situation of pre- or post-lapsarian man, as well as to sometimes denote the angels. Therefore, as a concept expressed through many terms, eunuch referred to a variety of cases and people, situations, and behaviors; at the same time, it alluded to the biblical imaginary and the theological symbolism established upon it. However, the secondary literature dedicated to eunuchs has until now mainly focused on the ektomiai, or castrati, and the roles they assumed in Byzantine society. The history of the study of eunuchs in Byzantium closely follows and, in a way, exemplifies the ways in which modern historians have viewed Byzantium itself more generally (i.e., in close relation to the values of their own societies). In general, moving past the strongly orientalist perspective which prevailed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scholars proceeded to study the role of eunuchs in the administration of state and Church. Eunuchs are treated in these approaches as a separate category of people or as influential individuals who were sometimes even worthy of a biography. In recent years, eunuchs have begun to be treated as sexual beings and a discussion has arisen concerning the question of whether they constituted a third sex or gender or whether they remained within the margins of the sexual dimorphism that was seen as a divinely established ‘reality.’ These approaches, which appeared successively, are now studied in a comprehensive fashion and have given rise to a fairly diversified bibliographical landscape, where the study of the political role of eunuchs coexists with that which focuses on their sexual identity. An openly orientalist (and regressive) approach nevertheless remains present in publications for the general public and in historical novels.",

As such, it provides a compelling framework for understanding the origins of injury problems and for identifying multiple countermeasures to address those problems. However, users then must decide for themselves among the alternatives. This paper adds a third dimension to the matrix to facilitate its use for making decisions about which countermeasures to apply.\n\nThe matrix of four columns and three rows combines public health concepts of host-agent-environment as targets of change with the concepts of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.3 ,4 More specifically, the factors defined by the columns in the matrix refer to the interacting factors that contribute to the injury process (see tables 1 and 2). The host column refers to the person at risk of injury. The agent of injury is energy (for example mechanical, thermal, electrical) that is transmitted to the host through a vehicle (inanimate object) or vector (person or other animal).

Predictable cycles or rhythms in behavior are expressed on several different time scales such as circadian (circa diem, or approximately 24-hour rhythms) and infradian (exceeding 24 hours, such as monthly or seasonal cycles). The circadian timekeeping system underlying rhythmic behaviors in mammals is constituted by a network of clocks distributed throughout the brain and body, the activity of which synchronizes to a central pacemaker, or master clock. Our daily experiences with the external environment including social activity strongly influence the clock mechanism operates at the level of our genes, but its exact timing of this network is synchronized by our experiences with the external environment including social activity. In the present review, we examine evidence from a number of species and propose that anger and reactive aggression interact in multiple ways with circadian clocks. Specifically, we argue that i) there are predictable rhythms in the expression of aggression and anger, ii) disruptions of the normal functioning of the body clock circadian system increase the likelihood of aggressive behaviors, and iii) conversely, chronic expression of anger can disrupt normal rhythmic cycles of physiological activities and create conditions for pathologies such as cardiovascular disease to develop. Taken together, these observations suggest that a comprehensive perspective on anger and reactive aggression must incorporate an understanding of the role of the body circadian timing system in these intense affective states.",

      "abstract": "Many people assume that swearwords is a rude word and should be avoided. Those words are used to insult, to curse, to offend or to mock at something when the speaker has strong emotion (Hughes, 1991,05). To swear at someone or something is to insult and deprecate the object of abuse, as well as to use other kinds of dysphemism (Allan & Burridge, 2006,76). Apparently some experts and scholars have been able to prove that swearwords also has a purpose and a meaning beside the one as commonly held. Therefore, the writer took the Alpha Dog movie as an example of the analyzed cases. Examples have been found by the writer including the categories of epithets derived from tabooed bodily organs, epithets derived from bodily effluvia, epithets derived from sexual behaviours, dysphemistic epithets that pick on real physical characteristics that are treated as though they are abnormalities, imprecations and epithets invoking mental subnormality or derangement. Finally, the writer also managed to find a purpose or a reason for the people to use swearwords in real life.",

They are the means by which one organism gains some advantage to the detriment of another. No hint of genuine charity ameliorates our vision of society, once sentimental ism has been laid aside. What passes for co-operation turns out to be a mixture of opportunism and exploitation. The impulses that lead one animal to sacrifice himself for another turn out to have their ultimate rationale in gaining advantage over a third; and acts ‘for the good’ of one society turn out to be performed to the detriment of the rest. Where it is in his own interest, every organism may reasonably be expected to aid his fellows. Where he has no alternative, he submits to the yoke of communal servitude. Yet given a full chance to act in his own interest, nothing but expediency will restrain him from brutalizing, from maiming, from murdering-his brother, his mate, his parent or his child. Scratch an ‘altruist’, and watch a ‘hypocrite’ bleed.",

      "title": "Decision‐making and Neuroeconomics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Decision‐making is the process of choosing one out of several alternatives. The study of decision‐making is inherently multidisciplinary and can be approached from many different angles. Traditional accounts in economics and biology have a normative flavour and prescribe, rather than describe decision‐making. Recently, however, efforts in psychology and behavioural ecology have resulted in the development of theories with higher descriptive validity. Furthermore, neuroeconomics is a new interdisciplinary field that combines contributions from economics, biology and psychology and aims to identify a biologically valid, mechanistic, mathematical and behavioural theory of choice and exchange. Recent neurophysiological advances have further deepened our understanding of the mechanistic implementation of a decision in the brain. Key Concepts Utility function : A mathematical function that models the relationship between an objective measure of a commodity (such as money) and the subjective value or desirability of that commodity. The utility function is often assumed to be concave, which is supposed to underly risk aversion. Risk attitude : Animals and humans are almost never risk neutral, i.e. when choosing between a very risky and a less risky (or even certain) option, most organisms prefer the less risky option ( risk aversion ) even if the payoff of both options is identical, or even better for the risky option. Occasionally, some individuals systematically prefer the more risky option ( risk proneness ). Expected utility theory : Normatively flavoured model in economics that tries to prescribe how humans should make decisions under risk. It is assumed that decision‐makers compute the probability‐weighted sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, integrate them with their current asset, and then choose the option the highest expected utility in final assets. Discounted utility theory : Similar model to expected utility, but for decisions in time. The weighting factor in discounted utility theory is not probability, but a function of the delay between choice and consumption. Game theory : Framework to formalize choice behaviour involving multiple interacting decision‐makers. A game allows to isolate and investigate in a controlled environment a limited set of premises of economic decision theory. Prospect theory : Alternative theory to expected utility theory with higher descriptive validity. It is assumed that outcomes of a decision are evaluated with respect to changes in wealth (gains versus losses), not in final states. Furthermore, the utility function is concave in the domain of gains, and convex in the domain of losses, and steeper for losses than for gains. Choice heuristic : A simple decision rule, or set of rules, that humans and animals apply to make decisions in complex environments. Optimal foraging theory : Based on the assumption that evolution should have favoured the development of decision mechanisms that maximize Darwinian fitness, optimal foraging theory aims to explore animal behaviour from an optimal choice perspective. Neuroeconomics : Interdisciplinary field that attempts to identify a biologically valid, mechanistic, mathematical and behavioural theory of choice and exchange.",

      "abstract": "The American anthropologist Edward B. Harper coined the concept ‘respect pollution’ for a practice where a person shows respect towards another person at a higher level in the Hindu ritual hierarchy by doing something in relation to the latter that would normally be regarded as involving impurity and pollution. That could be touching someone’s feet or foot wear, eating the lefto-vers of others, or getting in physical contact with urine or feces. What would normally be regarded as impure becomes a source of purification or even salvation when it is an index of a ritually superior person, say, a saint or a god, or even, for women, one’s husband. This article explains the background of these practices in the classical rules of purification known from the medieval Hindu law literature with respect to each of these cases, feet, sandals, leftovers, feces and urine, but ex-pands the field by including places of death and cremation. In the second part of the article examples are given of the ways these cases are turned into ‘respect pollution’. Ritual pollution; ritual impurity; ritual purity; ritual purification; Edward B.

      "title": "Evolutionary Establishment of Moral and Double Moral Standards Through Spatial Interactions",
      "abstract": "Situations where individuals have to contribute to joint efforts or share scarce resources are ubiquitous. Yet, without proper mechanisms to ensure cooperation, the evolutionary pressure to maximize individual success tends to create a tragedy of the commons (such as over-fishing or the destruction of our environment). This contribution addresses a number of related puzzles of human with an evolutionary game theoretical approach as it has been successfully used to explain the of other biological species many times, from bacteria to vertebrates. Our agent-based model distinguishes individuals applying four different behavioral strategies: non-cooperative individuals (defectors), cooperative individuals abstaining from punishment efforts (called or second-order free-riders), cooperators who punish non-cooperative (moralists), and defectors, who punish other defectors despite being non-cooperative themselves (immoralists). By considering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model reveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate cooperators. This spreading of punishing requires a segregation of behavioral strategies and solves the second-order free-rider problem. Second, the system changes its character significantly even after very long times (who laughs last laughs best effect). Third, the presence of a number of defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing cooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists in a way that appears like an unholy collaboration. Our findings suggest that the consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the establishment and spreading of moral behavior by means of game-theoretical concepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches are powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical concepts so far. The complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomes understandable as result of an evolutionary competition between different behavioral strategies.",

In contrast, an omission lacks a physical reality; it does not display any (causal) energy; it is, in this sense, simply non-existent. As a consequence of such a naturalistic approach, it has been argued that omissions cannot actually cause any result and thus cannot have any legal relevance, let alone create criminal liability.",

It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good; otherwise the imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the laws of the moral order.",

A perfect being is “whatever it is…better to be than not to be.” For a perfect being, existing necessarily is equivalent to lacking three less-making attributes. Prima facie, it is better to be than not to be lacking less-makers. So prima facie, a perfect being would exist necessarily. This prima facie conclusion becomes ultima facie if being necessary would come at an acceptable cost. It would. So a perfect being would be necessary. The three less-makers are mortality, the ability entirely to miss out on existing, and the ability to miss past time it would have been good to live through. Here is why they are less-makers. A perfect being would be guaranteed a good life. It is good to be able to die if one is not. But if one’s life can only be good, death has to be a loss of overall good. So being able to die is being able to miss out on goods. If missing out is bad, the chance to miss out is bad too. Mortality provides this chance. Again, because a perfect being would be guaranteed a good life, being “able” never to exist is being “able” to miss out on goods. So is being “able” also to have missed past good time.",

It ranges from the description applied by the sporting amateur (with perhaps a slight air of condescension or self righteousness) to one who quite frankly earns his living by the exercise of his aptitude in some particular sport, to the practitioners of vocations hallowed by antiquity and revered because of their one-time remoteness from the common herd. To be a “professional” is to use a facility for sames or sport for a living; and in consequence to be regarded with something only a little better than horror by the “amateurs.” To be a “professional man” or “woman,” or to be a member of one of the “professions” implies a standing, in some eyes, only a little less than divine and certainly very far removed from the taint of “professionalism” as applied to sport.",

      "title": "Thinking About What is Not the Case",
      "abstract": "It is usually assumed that when children set reality aside, and start to use their imagination, they think in an associative or undisciplined fashion. Contrary to this view, endorsed by Piaget and Freud alike, I argue that children often use their imagination in a consequential and logical fashion. First, children can work out the causal consequence of make‐believe transformations. For example, having seen a toy animal doused with make‐believe liquid, 2‐year‐olds realise the make‐believe consequences: they pretend to dry the animal or describe it as “wet”. Second, when presented with premises that run counter to their empirical knowledge (e.g., “All cats bark”) preschool children can make appropriate deductions from such premises provided they are prompted to adopt a make‐believe stance toward them. Third, despite knowing that a given belief or conclusion about reality is false, 4‐ and 5‐year‐olds recognise that it may be entertained and acted on by someone who is mistaken. Nevertheless, some children do occasionally fit the more traditional description of children's imagination: asked to imagine what they know to be false (e.g., that there is a rabbit or a fairy inside a box), they begin to wonder whether it might be true after all, and open the box to check.",

      "abstract": "Access to and control of resources is a major source of costly conflicts. Animals, under some conditions, respect what others control and use (i.e. possession). Humans not only respect possession of resources, they also respect ownership. Ownership can be viewed as a cooperative arrangement, where individuals inhibit their tendency to take others' property on the condition that those others will do the same. We investigated to what degree great apes follow this principle, as compared to human children. We conducted two experiments, in which dyads of individuals could access the same food resources. The main test of respect for ownership was whether individuals would refrain from taking their partner's resources even when the partner could not immediately access and control them. Captive apes (N = 14 dyads) failed to respect their partner's claim on food resources and frequently monopolized the resources when given the opportunity. Human children (N = 14 dyads), tested with a similar apparatus and procedure, respected their partner's claim and made spontaneous verbal references to ownership. Such respect for the property of others highlights the uniquely cooperative nature of human ownership arrangements.",

As soon as any other aim is consciously connected with the play, as money gained in cards and roulette, or the \"record\" in competitions, the activity loses its character of play, pure and simple. The influence of the present in play is to be seen in the fact that the trend of the aims dominating the child's life at the time comes into evidence in it. Certain associations are then clearly recognizable: the wish for knowledge, movement, adornment, appearance and imitation are the direct causes of definite forms of play. The power of play in such self-teaching is possible from the fact that the practice takes place in harmless material; play is indeed to life as manoeuvres to warfare. The psychic function that causes such influence is imitation, according to Spencer's theory the only factor determining the kind and nature of the play.",

In combination with metonymy, structural similarity gives rise to paragon-based antonomasia and allegory-like narratives. An example of paragon-based antonomasia is the Lennon of football, which, said about a great player, is based on structural similarity: the player and the musician are masters, each in his domain of expertise. Allegory-like narratives rely on a form of high-level structural similarity where each entity-denoting target element is elaborated through the member-for-class metonymy. For example, in \"The Prodigal Son\", the regretful son's return to his father asking for forgiveness represents any repentant sinner. In terms of structural similarity, God is to a repentant sinner what the forgiving father is to his returning son. Drawing on a selection of examples, this article reexamines the contribution of different types of structural similarity to figurative reasoning at various degrees of abstractness and complexity.",

or if his wife should be killed in an automobile accident and these fifty-two units of resistance removed, it is equally obvious that unless some other factor is added suicide will result.Taking a less depressing illustration, let us assume that the Detroit Tigers offered the owners of the New York Yankees one hundred thousand dollars for Babe Ruth.Whether Ruth would be sold is likewise governed by this same law.Assume, for ex- ample, that the Yankee owners considered Ruth worth more than that sum to them.It is obvious that in order to secure him the Tigers must increase the drive as expressed in the desire of the Yankee owners for money; or the trade might be brought about LAWS OF DRIVES AND RESISTANCES 17 litter of eight rats was divided into two groups of three each, and the two remaining rats were used as controls.Three rats of the first group were placed in cages out of doors with a temperature varying from 40°t o 60°F .; the second group of three rats were placed in a heated room with a temperature of approximately 90°F .; and the control animals were placed in a room with a temperature of about 70°F .One hundred and forty strips of paper with which to build nests were placed in each cage.During the first forty hours the animals in the heated room built fewer nests than the outdoor animals or the controls, and after forty hours they built no nests at all.The total number of nests built by the three rats in the heated room was only fourteen, the average number of strips used by each rat per six-hour period being 11.5, 11.7, and 6.6.During the same period the outdoor animals built thirty-eight nests and used, respectively, 44, 52, and 38.6 strips of paper per six-hour period.It was found, however, that when exposed to extreme cold (below 50°F .) the nest-building activity dropped out almost completely and the animals remained inactive.Seventy hours after the beginning of the experiment, when the rats from the out- door cages were placed in the heated room, their nest-building activ- ity ceased almost immediately.This law is illustrated in human affairs by the effect of weather conditions on the desire for alcohol as indicated by the greatly in- creased number of arrests for drunkenness during cold rainy days.The effect of spring weather in increasing the sex drive is seen not only in case of the lower animals, but in man as well.To keep the romantic feelings of youth within proper bounds, in the spring many jurisdictions find it advisable to detail additional police to take care of such violations as parking automobiles at night without lights along the highways.In some suburban com- munities arrests for this violation are from fifty to seventy-five per cent higher during May and June than during September and October.Law 10: The strength of many drives seems to have certain rhyth- mical variations.In Kinder's experiment it was found that the nest-building drive in female rats after puberty shows a periodic variation in strength, being least during oestrum and strongest a EFFECT OF INTERNAL STIMULI ON BEHAVIOR in to their feeling of fatigue long before actual capacity for work is decreased.Both of these types, however, other things being equal, profit in increased efficiency and feeling of well-being by alternate periods of work and rest.(3) Distraction.Any distraction such as noise has a tiring effect on the nervous system due to the disturbance of attention.The worker can adjust himself more readily to continual noises such as the hum of machinery than unexpected noises such as dropping boxes, for the sudden noise calls up a sort of fear reaction.If the noise is continuous, the worker soon becomes negatively adjusted, but each time that the sudden noise occurs it calls for adjustment.(4) Complexity.Complexity of the work by calling upon more muscles and exacting closer attention tends to make the work more fatiguing unless it is offset by greater interest on the part of the worker.In the latter case, although the element of fatigue is not eliminated, it may be more tolerable than monotony.Although uniformly repeated acts tend to become automatic and the nerve centers become less liable to fatigue, the sense of monotony may become fatiguing in itself.This is particularly true in the case of the worker who knows he is capable of doing more complex work.Workmen of a low grade of intelligence are not very likely to feel the monotony of doing a routine job, and in fact prefer doing the type of work that will require the least thinking.(5) Lighting.Bad lighting not only makes an output of standard quality difficult, but it causes headaches and other effects due to eye strain.Adequate light for the work in hand is not enough; the light, to be the most efficient and least fatiguing should be so diffused that the shadows are at a minimum.This is more im- portant in night work where the strain upon the eyes is especially great.(6) Posture.Posture is a particularly important element in fatigue.A slouching posture cramps the lungs and other vital organs and weakens endurance.In industry the best measure to secure proper posture comes from providing the right tables and chairs for the work.Many States have legal requirements regard- ing seats in industry, but most of them specify only \"provision of seats,\" and no distinction is made between a box and the best- Complete absence of this vitamin in the diet leads to decline and death.Rapid and complete recovery follows the administration of proper amounts of the vitamin.Deficiency in this vitamin results in zero-ophthalmia, an eye disease.Deficiency in vitamin B results in a type of nerve disease known as beri-beri, and in loss of appetite.Deficiency in vitamin C, which is found abundantly in such fruits as oranges, lemons, and tomatoes, results in scurvy.Vitamin D, which is present in large quantities in cod- liver oil, prevents rickets in children.Vitamin E is necessary for reproduction, and a deficiency in it lessens the sex urge.Organic salts.The part played by mineral salts in controlling 1",

Everyone learns, consciously or not, accurately or not, various ways of controlling others for one's own ends. Few people spend much time calculating how to control others, but everyone does so part of the time. Whatever people do, for whatever goals, will be evaluated by others, who will become thereby more or less willing to cooperate, more or less likely to resist, more or less likely to continue in the relationship. We all interact with others, engage in a flow of transactions with others; and whatever we do has some effect on others, to our advantage or not, in conformity with our wishes or not, and whether or not we will it so. Consequently, however else we might classify the wide range of human acts, we can also view them as samples of social control processes, i.e., the ways by which people shape the flow of each other's behavior. Almost all can be grouped into a small number of tvyes of social control forces. One of these is force and forcethreat, which I shall henceforth simply call force; when I mean only I shall so label it.' The use of force-and I repeat, I mean by this term both force-threat and overt force-is as ubiquitous as the preachments against it. Whatever else social systems are, they are also force systems. Force constitutes one of the major foundations of all social structures. The processes by which the command of force is expended, exchanged, accumulated, or lost, are universal in social interaction, because force is one of the fundamental resources people and groups need to elicit cooperation, help, and conformity from one another. Force constitutes one of the four great social control systems in all societies. For two millennia, social analysts have given much attention to three of these-which they have variously termed force, prestige, and wealth-because these underlie all stratification systems.2 The fourth, which",

Both ICD-10 and DSM-IV identify three main classes of phobias: specific phobias, social phobia, and agoraphobia. The latter two are often referred to as complex phobias. In specific phobias, the fear is limited to one or more well-de- fined classes of objects or situations: e.g., certain animals, aspects of the natural environment (heights, storms), specific situations (lifts, airplanes) or blood/injuries. Social phobia is characterized by fear of one or more social situations, while agoraphobia is defined by fear of leaving home or of places or situations from which escape may be difficult, including shops, crowds, and public places, or fear of travelling (alone) in trains, buses, or planes. The emphasis in this paper will be on specific phobias and social phobia, since agoraphobia is discussed in another article in this supplement (1).",

      "title": "MURDER WITHOUT APPARENT MOTIVE: A STUDY IN PERSONALITY DISORGANIZATION",
      "abstract": "In this paper we have described a number of common characteristics found in individuals who have committed impulsive senseless murders. These characteristics were: severe weakness of impulse control; blurring of the boundaries between fantasy and reality, with periods of altered states of consciousness; blunted and shallow emotional reactions; and a violent and primitive fantasy life. This constellation seems to have grown out of a history characterized by extreme parental violence and early severe emotional deprivation. In these cases, there appeared an ego weakness which allowed the periodic breakthrough of intense aggressive impulses, sometimes of homicidal proportion. When such apparently senseless murders occur, they are seen to be an end result of a period of increasing tension and disorganization in the murderer starting before the contact with the victim who, by fitting into the unconscious conflicts of the murderer, unwittingly serves to set into motion his homicidal potential. It remains a task of future research to: 1. Differentiate these individuals from other murderers as well as from others with similar disturbances but who do not kill; 2. Weigh the significance of the individual factors described; 3. Devise measures for identifying and effectively controlling these individuals before they commit murder.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores how self-disgust may manifest as part of the experience of self-harm. In its primary form, disgust implies a set of behavioural and physiological rejection responses against contamination or incorporation of contaminant material. It involves a sudden arousal of feelings, physiological changes, and action impulses that aim to prevent the threatening object from crossing the body boundary or from spreading within it. People who self-harm are, prior to the act, either in a state of high arousal, in which overwhelming anger, anxiety, or a mixture of unidentifiable emotions is typically experienced, or they are depersonalised. Feeling out of control involves an experience of a lack of autonomy and agency over one's internal states. The self-harm act \"catches\" emotions that were previously felt to be \"untameable\" and amorphous; the wound, scar, and/or blood become a representation of the experience that can be attended to, contemplated, and something that the individual can act upon.",

      "title": "Internal Conflict",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. … the extraordinary propensity of the human being to join hands with external forces in an attack upon his own existence is one of the most remarkable of biological phenomena (Menninger 1938) The term 'superego’(which should perhaps be replaced by‘anti‐ego’) is used to denote a set of habitual response tendencies that are antagonistic to the self, and cause the subject to behave as if he were two separate persons at war with each other. The superego develops in early life and may be ‘punitive’or‘humiliating’or both. The former kind arises through learning to restrain the self from dangerously rebelling against overwhelming coercion, and the latter through intense striving to avoid parental scorn. The resultant‘internal’conflict resembles the external one between an actual child and a demanding parent; and the relative fortunes of the two antagonists provide a model for understanding the characteristics of many kinds of emotional and psychosomatic disorder. Superego behaviour is propagated from generation to generation; and perpetuates itself in the individual by preventing the responses that, by proving it unnecessary, would lead to its extinction. Self‐punitive conditions are therefore highly resistant to treatment, which must be specially directed to the particular needs of each of the patient's two conflicting parts in turn. To be able to do this, psychotherapists themselves need to be freed from their own internal conflicts during training and later.",

      "title": "For the Love of God: Conservation as Devotion in Tamil Nadu",
      "abstract": "Many of the objects of Indian art history began their life as religious buildings or things. Some remain under worship and attract devotees; others have entered the secular frame as artworks and monuments, and are now valued for their aesthetic and historic significance. As they move from one category to another, buildings and artefacts find themselves placed within one of two regimes of care. Icons that are under worship are nurtured through regular lustrations and offerings of clothing and food, and living temples are often expanded and altered to serve growing congregations and changing needs. These processes support the spiritual life of the artefact while impinging upon its material body. But in the case of musealised artefacts and monuments, the priorities are reversed: utmost attention is paid to the preservation of their physical bodies and not the numinous presences that are meant to inhabit them (Image 13.1). Icons are to be stripped of extraneous matter, cleaned, and protected from touch and corrosive substances; temples are to be preserved in their original form without additions and alterations or coats of garish paint. Practices and substances that sustained the spiritual life of a building or artwork are seen as harmful for the material body of the art object, and secular institutions that took charge of India’s artefacts were able to justify their desacralization as a necessary condition for a superior kind of care that would ensure the survival of these objects in the longue durée. In this framework, it was the secular regime of care that possessed the expertise and the protocols that could preserve India’s heritage, which worshippers would actually damage and wear down through their devotions. This claim—that secularism preserved what devotionalism destroyed—gave authority to the state institutions as the legitimate entities responsible for the protection and conservation of monuments and works of art.",

Some basic value experiences may be momentary, analogous to points on a plane, while others, such as enjoying a horseback ride, will be stretched out over time, like lines in a plane. Experience stretched out in this way is sentient life; and when this life involves purposive activity with practical goals and attachments to things cared about that go beyond mere enjoyment or pleasure, we arrive at a second dimension of value.",

      "abstract": "‘How to live’: that is, how should we live, how is it best for us to live. In discussing Plato's phrase, Arnold left aside the particular nature of the claim that morality makes on us (as distinct from manners, say, or laws), but he did put succinctly the substantive question at the centre of moral thinking. On the other hand, he also managed to overlook a crucial ambiguity in the question. For it makes an important difference whether we emphasize the word ‘how’ or the word ‘live’: how to live, or how to live. Being perpetually moralists we ask both questions, of course; but to ask the former is to have in mind the moral-in-a-narrow-sense, whereas with the latter it is the moral-in-a-large-sense. With the former, we are asking about the difference between right and wrong (or good and bad) in human actions: that is, in what we call moral conduct; or between dispositions to, or habits of, right and wrong (good and bad) conduct: that is, in what we call moral virtues and vices; or between the sum total of a person's virtues and vices: that is, in what we call moral character. When we ask ‘how to live’ however, we are asking about the inner coherence of various modes of human life, and how to evaluate them as modes of life, individual or social; about the value of the manifold capacities, potentialities, wants and needs of human beings; about what is ‘truly’ human, or what the ‘perfection’ or ‘well-being’ of a life consists in, or what the finest and fullest modes of human vitality.",

      "abstract": "The term \"complementary medicine\" or \"alternative medicine\" refers to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system.[1] Ruqyah (plural: ruqa), an example of complementary medicine treatments, derives from the past tense verb raqa. It consists of words said or written in the form of dua or dhikr for the purpose of protection or cure. It is sometimes accompanied by other actions, such as blowing or wiping over the thing which it is applied to. \"It should be done by reciting the words of Allah, may He be exalted, or His names and attributes, and in Arabic or in a language the meaning of which is understood, and with the belief that ruqyah has no effect in and of itself; rather it is only effective by the will of Allah, may He be exalted.\"[2] Ruqyah practice can improve one's calmness, spiritual quality, and happiness, as a characteristic of an individual's mental health. Ruqyah practices are an effort to restore human nature (fitrah) that has inner peace and happiness.[3] The Quran says, \"Without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.\"[4] Herein, we presented the use of ruqyah as shifa (cure) in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders to draw attention to the importance of ruqyah applications in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Human Consciousness: Where Is It From and What Is It for",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is not a process in the brain but a kind of behavior that, of course, is controlled by the brain like any other behavior. Human consciousness emerges on the interface between three components of animal behavior: communication, play, and the use of tools. All three do not exclusively distinguish our close relatives, i.e., primates, but are broadly presented among various species of mammals, birds, and even cephalopods. These three components interact on the basis of anticipatory behavioral control, which is common for all complex forms of animal life. The interaction between communication and play yields symbolic games, the most important of which being language; the interaction between symbols and tools results in human praxis. Taken together, this gives rise to a mechanism that allows a creature, instead of performing controlling actions overtly, to play forward the corresponding behavioural options in a \"second reality\" of objectively (by means of tools) grounded symbolic systems. The theory possesses the following properties: 1. It is explicitly anti-reductionistic and anti-eliminativistic, and yet, human consciousness is considered as a purely natural (biological) phenomenon. 2. It avoids epiphenomenalism and indicates in which conditions human consciousness has evolutionary advantages, and in which it may even be disadvantageous. 3. It allows to easily explain the most typical features of consciousness, such as objectivity, seriality and limited resources, the relationship between consciousness and explicit memory, the feeling of conscious agency, etc. The relationships between the present model and other, traditional and modern, theories of consciousness, from substance dualism to Dennett's reductionism and Baars' Common Workspace model, remains a topic of a following analysis.",

However, for Gregory of Nyssa old age, like youth, sexual reproduction, passions or pain, was a consequence of the first sin rather than a characteristic feature of human nature, which was created by God at the beginning. In man’s beginnings God performed three important acts. In the first act He created hu­man nature considered to be an entity, without separation into male or female. During the second stage of creation God – anticipating sin of the first man – created individual human beings with specific sex. The third act took place after the sin, when God gave people clothes made of animal skins, by which Gregory understands an animal aspect of human life, alien to human nature, and old age is an element of this aspect. Nevertheless, in our present condition clothes made of animal skins could be used for a good cause, so also old age could be a stage on the road to eternal life. Although God did not plan it for man, after the first sin it has become for us something normal and even natural.",

      "title": "Neocolonial Politics of Caring Machines “For” and “Against” Humans",
      "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between man, nature, and technology through the construct of care identified by Martin Heidegger and in the correlation between care and vulnerability, the overcoming of which has served as a central catalyst for the evolution of the entire human history. In the article, the construct is defined as a dialogue between each of the designated elements of the triangle (nature and man, man and technology, technology and the environment) taking place in the field of power and mutual claims. Given the equal value of all three elements, the focus of attention is usually aimed at optimizing the state of knowledge primarily about a person and, if possible, adjusting the development trajectory. That is, having freed himself from the tutelage of nature, to compensate for his vulnerability a person resorts to the invention of tools and devices that promise safety and a reduced risk of dying in the clutches of predators or natural elements. But as tools and devices for defence improve, new challenges and threats arise from man’s own creations. So, eliminating one vulnerability leads to the emergence of new, even more complex forms. As a result, we can conditionally distinguish three basic instruments of care as something that 1) ensures the presence of a conditional thing; 2) declares the power of the one who cares over the one who finds himself in a cocoon of care; 3) can be transferred to another thing, dooming all past objects of attention to be left under the radar and ultimately to disappear.",

It is one of the worst consequences of this very spirit of controversy that it has led men to regard things too much in a single and exaggerated point of view.

      "abstract": "‘God,’ ‘ Theos,’ ‘Deus’ is of course a name borrowed from paganism; we take it out of its proper context, where it is used for talking about the gods, and use it for our own purposes. This is quite a legitimate piece of borrowing and quite safe so long as it does not mislead us into thinking that the God we worship (or don’t) is a god. We always do have to speak of our God with borrowed words; it is one of the special things about our God that there are no peculiar appropriate words that belong to him, as with the language of carpentry or computer-speak. He is always dressed verbally in second-hand clothes that don’t fit him very well. We always have to be on our guard against taking these clothes as revealing who and what he is. For this reason it is sometimes safer to use clothes that are quite obviously second-hand, words that have been quite scandalously ripped from their proper context and stretched and bent and distorted to suit our purposes. That is one reason for preferring ‘The Father’ to ‘God’ as a name for our God. ‘The Father’ is manifestly being used in a metaphorical or extended sense and so is unlikely to mislead us. It is also the word that Jesus prefers to use.",

      "abstract": "Many species of animals have consciousness, intentionality, and thought processes. By “consciousness” I mean those subjective states of sentience and awareness that we have during our waking life (and at a lower level of intensity in our dreams); by “intentionality” I mean that feature of the mind by which it is directed at or about objects and states of affairs in the world; and by “thought processes” I mean those temporal sequences of intentional states that are systematically related to each other, where the relationship is constrained by some rational principles. Examples of conscious states are such things as feeling a pain or hearing a sound. Examples of intentional states are such things as wanting to eat food or believing that someone is approaching. Examples of thought processes are such things as figuring how to get a banana that is out of reach or monitoring the behavior of prey who is on the move and is trying to escape. Though these three phenomena – consciousness, intentionality, and thought processes – overlap, they are not identical. Some conscious states are intentional, some not. Some intentional states are conscious, many are not. For example, my current thought that it is unlikely to rain is conscious, my belief when I am asleep that Bill Clinton is president of the United States is unconscious. All thought processes, as I have defined them, are intentional; but not every intentional state occurs as part of a thought process. For example, a pang of undirected anxiety, though conscious, is not intentional. A sudden desire for a cold beer is both conscious and intentional.",

      "abstract": "God is love. God is creator, God’s creation is the expression of his love. Man is created in the image and likeness of God. Man too is lover and creator. But for him, to love and to create is hard. It is hard to love, because so often when he sees a beautiful thing man wants to clutch at it, possess it, dominate, domineer, use it for himself, destroy it. It is hard to create, because creation comes only from love. There is no love and no creation without worship and humility and fear; and in order that we may have these things God takes us by the hand, and leads us to the trackless and waterless, places, and gives us the gift of pain. Man’s destiny is to create, in the image and likeness of God. We are not men and women unless we are makers, whether what we make be ships or sealing wax or cabbages or kingdoms. But for most men and women the primary creation is procreation; the primary work of art is married life. God gives us in each case the ecstasy of creation : the joy that follows the agony of making, the joy that follows the anguish of child-bearing. If we had only these gifts of joy and ecstasy we might forget the giver, and rest in the gifts and regard them as our own possession; we might cease to love and worship, and become beasts of prey. Love is worship. ‘With my body I thee worship ‘; the body conveys the message, but it is the whole I that worships, the whole of the body and its deepest roots, the whole of the spirit and its deepest roots, in one act of recognition and acceptance of oneness, of adoration and offering.",

      "title": "Quantitative experiments about falling and rebounding bodies of different shapes in view of Newton’s Third Law of Motion.",
      "abstract": "Abstract Newton stated third law of motion in the Principia implies that action and reaction are always equal and opposite in all possible cases (i.e. universally). The action and reaction occur in pairs simultaneously and inherently. In the Principia Newton gave examples to elaborate statement of the law expressing action and reaction in terms of push or pull (force). In the current physics the action and reaction as such are not regarded as physical quantities because units and dimensions are not assigned to action and reaction directly. Practically Newton initiated physics (without mathematical equations) separating it from natural philosophy. Here very sensitive aspect of the law is elaborated. In experiments we may have bodies of different materials such as wool, wood, cloth, spring, steel, rubber, clay, kneaded flour, chewing gum, sponge, typical plastic, porous material, air / fluid filled artifact, etc. The intrinsic characteristics of various bodies (inherent composition, nature, flexibility, elasticity, plasticity, rigidity, magnitude, size, distinctiveness of interacting bodies or mode of interactions, and other relevant factors like surfaces on which bodies interact.) may be different. Likewise, bodies may have different shapes (spherical, semi-spherical, umbrella shaped, triangular, square, cone, long pipe, flat, irregular or any possible shape). It has to be verified in all cases specifically. Newton has not mentioned about characteristics of target. The third law must be specifically confirmed in various simple experiments with the latest technological equipment. The quantitative nature of falling and rebounding bodies (preferably in vacuum) must be studied. In some qualitative observations the shape of bodies appears to be a significant factor. So, the law has been theoretically modified as reaction is proportional to action i.e. Reaction =- Q Action, where Q is coefficient of proportionality (accounts for shape of body and other factors which are not accounted for original form of the law). The effect of shape is equally applicable in one dimensional elastic collision. The collisions are theoretically studied but in typical experiments, shape of bodies play significant role. In 2016 in EM Drive experiments some deviations have been reported by NASA from third law, but the results are still inconclusive. Thus, the proposed experiments may lead to significant results in Newtonian Mechanics.",

      "title": "Thesis Abstract: Intellectual Paths and Pathologies: How Small Events in Scholarly Life Accidentally Grow Big (November 2009)",
      "abstract": "The initial conditions of certain ways of thinking sometimes lock us in to particular pathways. Such pathways occur when the follow-up of small events catches intellectuals in its complex web irreversibly and grow bigger in the future. The distinctive property of such conditions is that the evolution of ideas does not necessarily lead to any pre-defined end point. Small events trigger shifts in the course of events and this leads to (extra-) positive or (extra-) negative consequences that move the system away from its systematic course. After small events take place, complex webs of scholarly life function in either of two ways: (i) as a short-cut that moves the system to a better state and elevates it to higher levels of order which could only be reached within longer time spans if there had been no interruptions or (ii)as a hindrance that would break the system down and disallow intellectuals to proceed further and achieve intellectual advancement. When historical small events become a hindrance (ii), a little uncorrected error sometimes feeds back a negative cumulative effect on the progress of scientific knowledge. When historical small events operate as a short-cut (i), however, the conditions that turn an event into a starting point of a new pathway can be the breaking point of an old one as such that they unlock the old course of events bearing path dependent properties and perhaps lead to more complex evolutionary pathways. This would mean an upward movement of the system to more coherent and sophisticated levels.",

To meet the necessary condition for evolutionary survival in competition with rational self-interested players, the emotional party must benefit not only in “feel good” utility terms but in actual material payoff.

      "title": "Showtime’s Dexter: The horror of being (non)human",
      "abstract": "Abstract Showtime’s Dexter exemplifies the ‘nonhuman turn’ manifest as horror. It dramatizes, in its serial killer protagonist, the profound interconnectedness of the human and the nonhuman as well as a nonhuman ‘agency’ that undercuts the already limited power of humans to direct their own lives. It does so by consistently highlighting Dexter Morgan’s own determining nonhuman part, which he calls his ‘monster’, his ‘dark passenger’, his ‘shadow self’ – all terms that mark an anonymous ‘it’ and the threat it poses to the ‘human’ Dexter desperately wants to be. The series refuses, though, to define Dexter’s impersonal monstrousness as his alone, as a part of only his past or only his brain – or even, in the end, as a ‘monster’ that is in any way separate from the ‘human’. Dexter’s personal ‘dark passenger’, I argue, is shown to be a shared nonhuman life inherent in the condition of being human. This ‘it’ or ‘thing’ is represented in the series in Dexter’s human doubles, in animals, even in the weather. The ‘it’ of Dexter, in short, marks a nonhuman that is both an external and an internal nature and that is manifest precisely as their indistinction. Showtime’s groundbreaking series thus models a new kind of monster, as well as a new form of horror – one that recognizes the nonhuman in the human.",

      "title": "The evolutionary significance of mass extinctions",
      "abstract": "Darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space – the ‘struggle for existence’ – were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. This is clearly brought out by this quotation from The Origin of Species: . . . Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes . . . and the most important of all causes of organic change is one that is almost independent of altered . . . physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism – the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others. . . . The driving force of competition in a crowded world is also stressed in another quotation presenting Darwin’s famous wedge metaphor: . . . In looking at Nature, it is most necessary . . . never to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or the old, during each generation . . . The face of Nature may be compared to a yielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another with greater force. . . . The implication of the Darwinian view concerning the dominance of biotic competition is that for each winner there is a loser – a kind of zero-sum game. It has been accepted more or less uncritically by generations of evolutionary biologists, but not until the 1970s did it become graced with a name – the Red Queen hypothesis. The story behind the emergence of this name is an interesting one. At the beginning of the 1970s the rather eccentric University of Chicago palaeobiologist Leigh Van Valen did some interesting research concerning the analysis of survivors of Phanerozoic taxa which suggested that the probability of a fossil group becoming extinct was more or less constant in time. To account for this, Van Valen put forward his Red Queen hypothesis.",

In the later course of life people encounter circumstances that frustrate, humiliate, or grieve them, and these, too, may conceivably distort their personalities. It is convenient to apply the term personal stresses to all such experiences and circumstances that may have a more or less permanently adverse effect on a person's behavior. The term is necessarily a little vague in denotation because of the heterogeneity of the experiences and circumstances, but it is employed in a sense analogous to the use of stress in physics; it disregards the person's reaction to the experience or circumstances, which, on the same analogy, would be termed a strain. Thus, if a person lived during the late war in a street that had several direct hits within a short period, he would be said to have",

He could have rescued the victims of the evil, but – at least in many cases – He didn't. In short, God is an accessory before, during, and after the fact to countless evil deeds, great and small. An explanation is not far to seek. The obvious hypothesis is that the Christian God is really some sort of devil. Maybe He is a devil as popularly conceived, driven by malice. Or maybe He is unintelligibly capricious. Or maybe He is a fanatical artist who cares only for the aesthetic quality of creation – perhaps the abstract beauty of getting rich variety to emerge from a few simple laws, or perhaps the concrete drama of human life with all its diversity – and cares nothing for the good of the creatures whose lives are woven into His masterpiece. (Just as a tragedian has no business providing a happy end out of compassion for his characters.) But no; for Christianity also teaches that God is morally perfect and perfectly benevolent, and that He loves all of His creatures; and that these things are true in a sense not a million miles from the sense in which we attribute morality, benevolence, or love to one another. We turn next to the hypothesis that God permits evil-doing for the sake of its good effects.",

If you hypnotize a person to get her to assassinate your enemy, then you are responsible for the assassination. She cannot be blamed (except in the special case in which she is a willing accomplice, allowing herself to be hypnotized, in order to be a more effective assassin). Kidnapping, drugging and hypnosis are all methods of subjecting someone else to your will. But does persuading a person to do something count as a further method of controlling her, or subjecting her to your will? Intuitively, we want to say it does not. If you persuade me not to vote, then you get me to do what you want, but you do so in a way that leaves me in control. Having been persuaded does not exempt me from blame, as having been kidnapped, drugged or hypnotized would do. However, this intuitive view proves surprisingly difficult to justify. What makes being persuaded different? Why isn't persuading someone to do something simply a further way of controlling what she does?",

      "abstract": "Several problems present themselves when discussing the concept of obsolescence in relation to human behaviour within organisations. Most definitions of ‘obsolescence’ in fact refer to evaluations of inanimate physical phenomena within a dynamic context, not to human behaviour as such. Thus ‘obsolescent’ is often defined as ‘going out of date’, ‘falling into disuse’, or in accountants' terminology, as part of the process of calculating depreciation, involving the assessment of the ‘inadequacy of an asset relative to newer models’. Yet these ‘definitions’ beg the question. When is a machine (or an operative or manager) ‘out of date’, when is any asset, human or otherwise, ‘inadequate’ as compared to something ‘newer’ and where is the dividing line between ‘new’ and ‘old’ to be placed? These questions suggest that to define what we mean by ‘obsolescent’ in relation to any phenomenon, involves essentially a process of evaluation in the light of selected criteria in some particular context.",

      "title": "13. Killing of companion animals: to be avoided at all costs?",
      "abstract": "Looking into end of life decisions concerning companion animals roughly two kinds of issues can be identified. On the one hand we sometimes kill companion animals too late causing unnecessary suffering and on the other hand there are situations in which might we kill them too fast, depriving them a natural lifespan and possible future wellbeing. These situations raise moral questions about role and responsibilities of pet owners and veterinarians and about justification of end of life decisions regarding companion animals. We can address these questions by looking at the implications of moral standing of companion animals in modern Western societies. The so-called human-companion animal bond implies a moral obligation to take the interests of our companion animals seriously into account. I will argue that when making decisions about end of life of our companion animals, the interests of the concerned animal will normally outweigh the interests of the owner. An animal's future quality of life is the most important parameter. We therefore have a moral obligation to euthanize animals in case of unbearable and hopeless suffering. Killing healthy companion animals however can only be justified in special circumstances. To help veterinarians in making difficult end of life decisions, we have developed an assessment model. By using this model veterinarians are guided to carefully weigh all the different interests in play and make justified decisions about killing companion animals.",

The principal gods, whom the people assert to be superhuman, were most probably human beings who for some cause were held in veneration and were deified after death. So far as the present generation of people know, there never have been any material objects to represent the gods: they have ever been merely names, and only a few of the gods had temples in which priests and mediums resided. The influence of a god was confined to some locality, as in Uganda, and it was necessary to have some object to which the mysterious presence and power of the god could communicate itself so as to be taken into other parts of the country. For this purpose fetishes were made and kept in the homes of the people or carried about for particular purposes. Amulets were worn to ward off disease or as a protection against wild animals or reptiles, while others were intended to be used medicinally by scraping or by rubbing them on stones and mixing the powder thus obtained with water for internal use, or by mixing it with butter for external application.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, the author of a history or saint's life identifies him or herself in such a way as to authenticate the truth and quality of the material. Positioning counts: that of a courtier or family member or disciple or army-follower. The writer claims to know the subject but modes of asserting this may vary: education, intellect, access to written sources, may count or, in the case of hagiography, may be discounted in favour of a different familiarity. The claim may of course be tacit, as when a writer continues someone else's work and inherits his authority by default. In a well-functioning work, the self-identifying trope is tacitly or overtly matched to need, and this remains largely true of those sophisticated eleventh-century and twelfth-century histories where the historian freely writes himself or herself into events. The difference is that options have increased; the self-identifying can take as many forms as phases of the narrative require and any of these may function in more ways than one. Of course, some functions may be extra-textual: they may be personally or politically driven, as when Michael Attaleiates lauds Botaneiates, or Michael Psellos idealizes Michael Doukas and his son, or when Anna Komnene shakes her fist at Alexios's successors. In this chapter, I shall leave those to one side and consider modes of self-identification in these Middle Byzantine authors, which work towards a larger textual purpose.",

      "title": "ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS ABOUT HUMAN IN CONNECTION WITH INCREASING DIFFICULTY OF PATIENT CARE. INTRODUCTION",
      "abstract": "Ideas about a person help you understand or explain your own actions or the actions of others. Individual and scientific images of a person are transmitted through upbringing and education, possibly also through \"genetic\" memory. These images of people form the structure of human perception. Human actions are ultimately based on this perception. Thinking about one's own image of a person and deciphering other people's images of a person always have a reductionist character. This may explain why action-oriented disciplines such as a doctor, psychologist or nurse have a specific view of the person. The successes of individual scientific disciplines are the result of a deep division, or rather, the dismemberment of the whole in order to supposedly better explain or understand a person. But putting the pieces back together is often overlooked. The process of disassembling or deepening and thus constantly recognizing the essence of a person is an ongoing task. However, people often make decisions against the background of current (everyday) observations. But this also means that before making decisions for the future, we must think in advance about their consequences for a person. The formulation of such foresight or scenarios of the future must be made on the basis of the perception of the entire human being, and not only take into account the consequences for partial concepts of the human being. In the health care system, patients, professions and institutions meet each other. These professions, equipped, by the way, with an excellent repertoire of scientific discoveries made for humanity within the framework of individual sciences, are faced precisely for this reason with conflicting images and perspectives of humanity. The latter influence practical actions. Parallel to this, a growing individualization of therapeutic therapies can be observed in practice. This increases the complexity of the activity. It also means the development or, rather, a clearer differentiation of subjects into specialists and generalists. In other words, we are talking about processes based on the division of labor, in which the specialist receives a higher status in terms of competence in decision-making, economics and social power. The article examines the subjective orientation in the treatment of diseases and the need for care, the consequences of a supra-institutional perspective of therapeutic processes and the solution of the problem of divergence of competencies and interests of actors through the perspective of a person in his essential unity.",

      "abstract": "Interpassivity is a widespread, but mostly unacknowledged form of cultural behavior. It consists in letting others (other people, or animals, machines etc.) not work, but consume in one’s place. When certain people, for example, take care that others drink their beer for them, fotocopy or print texts out instead of reading them, let recording devices watch TV programmes in their place, use ritual machines that pray or believe for them vicariously, or are happy that certain TV-comedies already laugh about themselves, we have to speak of interpassivity. These actions are based on certain subjects’ preference to delegate their enjoyment instead of having it themselves. This, obviously, raises a number of quite uncanny, fundamental questions: Why do certain people do not want to have their enjoyment? And why do they, if the do not want to enjoy, go to such great pains in order to ensure that somebody else enjoys in their place? The theory of interpassivity has had considerable impacts on several disciplines such as philosophy, art theory, psychoanalysis, media theory, political theory, anthropology, theory of religion etc. This volume assembles essays that reach from the fundamental philosophical questions, concerning the paradoxical pleasure gained from delegated enjoyment, to their most current consequences: for example concerning interactivity and participation in the arts and in politics, generosity in culture, the status of belief, ritual and magic, cultural capitalism, civilized urban role-play etc.",

Man made laws which in their essence are not laws in the true sense but rules laid down by man for man which can be amended at a later time or date or year. An observation repeatedly observed and always happens, can be considered as law, for eg; NEWTON’S Law of gravity or gravitational. Did Dr. Hering modify Dr. Hahnemann’s observation? Yes.

      "title": "Icebreakers: Environmentalism and Natural Aesthetics",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT What have natural aesthetics and environmentalism in common? Not much if the former deals with nature as if it were an artwork or a gallery of art objects, or if the latter grounds the protection of nature in consequentialist terms. Suppose, however, one adopts a non‐consequentialist environmentalism which, further, stakes out a primary view of nature as terrain rather than as habitat; i.e., a view which is not biocentric (life‐centred), let alone anthropocentric. This environmentalism is rooted in the belief that we are prima facie bound not to interfere in any of the world undefined by culture whether or not it supports life . There is a reason forbidding us from strip‐mining the far side of the moon, say, even though no habitat is thereby destroyed, nor is there any blight creating visual offence to those immediately affected. To furnish the reason for such an ‘acentric’environmentalism, one needs a natural aesthetic. Why? By elimination, because the stock appeals grounding any moral stance—to rights or interests or happiness or autonomy—are unavailable. The ‘subject’of an acentric environmentalism is insensate. But an ‘acentric’aesthetic seems even more curious than its environmentalist dependent. It would entail an aesthetic viewpoint indifferent to human scale and perspective, the very factors which underwrite any cultural aesthetic. So, is such an aesthetic possible? The barest glimpse of how it might look concludes this paper.",

      "title": "The Law of Nature as the Moral Law",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although Hobbes talks about the laws of nature as prescribing the virtues, it is easier to think of them as proscribing the vices. The nine vices that are proscribed by the laws of nature are injustice, ingratitude, greed or inhumanity, vindictiveness (Hobbes does not name the vice corresponding to mercy, this is my attempt to provide one.), cruelty, incivility or contumely, pride, arrogance, and unfairness (I take this to be the vice corresponding to equity). The corresponding virtues that are prescribed by the laws of nature are justice, gratitude, humanity or complaisance, mercy, (Hobbes does not give, and I do not know what would count as, the virtue corresponding to his account of cruelty), civility, humility, (Hobbes uses this as one of the names for the virtue corresponding to the vice of arrogance, but I am using it as the opposite of pride.), modesty, and equity. The difficulty of coming up with names for some of the virtues, and even for some of the vices, shows that they are not all among the most common moral virtues and vices. Nonetheless, as described by Hobbes, they are genuine moral virtues and vices, traits of character such that all impartial rational persons would favor everyone having the virtues and no one having the vices. All of these virtues are such that they benefit everyone impartially by promoting peace, and are not primarily of benefit to the person having them. This is what makes them moral virtues and distinguishes them from the personal virtues of courage, prudence, and temperance. (See H, XIII, 9) The laws of nature are the dictates \"of right reason, conversant about those things which are either to be done or omitted for the constant preservation of life and members, as much as in us lies.\" (C, II, 1; see also L, XIV, 3) But the law of nature \"dictating peace, for a means of the conservation of men in multitudes;\" (L, XV, 34; see also C, III, 32) is also the moral law because \"in the means to peace, [it] commands also good manners, or the practice of virtue; and therefore it is called moral.\" (C, III, 31; see also L, XV, 40) Hobbes correctly sees both that peace benefits all persons impartially and that impartiality is essential to morality. His account of the moral virtues correctly makes them traits of character that would be favored by all impartial persons. His argument for the rationality of these moral virtues is that one's self-interest, which for Hobbes is primarily one's long-term preservation, is enhanced by having these virtues. There is no incompatibility between morality and self-interest as long as what is in one's own self-interest is equally in the interest of everyone else. Hobbes sees this point quite clearly and it is at the heart of his justification of the moral virtues.",

      "title": "Understanding And Individuality In The Three Cities: An Interpretation Of Plato's Laws 1",
      "abstract": "In the Laws, Plato asks, first of all, whether humanity, through reason and the political art, possesses some sovereignty in ordering human life to the divine good, and secondly, whether the human individual has the freedom to realize this good in and through his own private interests. Does humanity have any substantial meaning, or does it exist as a mere toy of the gods? Does the individual, in his human attachments, desires, and doubts, have a relation to the historical manifestation of divine objectivity (the state), 2 or is this connection to the whole only achieved through denying these aspects of life that differentiate us from our common identity as citizens? 3 Guiding these political questions in the Laws is one of the most fundamental questions to the whole Platonic philosophy: does that which is many, different and particularizing have any existence and truth, or is it merely opposed to the truth of the complete, undivided whole? What is the relation between self-complete divinity and incomplete humanity? In answering these questions, the Laws belies a fundamental tension between recognizing and repressing difference. There is, on the one hand, an emphasis in the dialogue upon the importance that the individual personally understand and internalize the rationality of the laws, and that he retain certain aspects of the private realm of human 1 This interpretation arose out of a graduate seminar on Plato's Laws co-taught by Richard Kraut and Sarah Monoson at Northwestern University. I express thanks to both of them for their helpful criticisms, and to all the other participants in the seminar for their contributions, many of which are undoubtedly reflected in my argument. I also thank Michael Naas for his helpful comments on this paper. 2 Throughout the Republic, Statesman, and Laws, the relation between the common identity of the state (as promoted by the ruling principle of the city) and the various natural interests of individuals as separate from this political unity is intimately related to two important aspects of Plato's ontology. This political relation of ruler and ruled, of state and individual interests, corresponds to the structure of the first principle and its relation to everything that is other than this principle, as well as the relation between a form and the different and divided instantiations of its universal identity. I call the state, for this reason, the historical manifestation of divine objectivity. Because of this intimate connection in Plato's thought between ontology and politics, if he cannot show the logical connection between the united Good and its divided manifestation, or, in the language of the late dialogues, between the limit and the unlimited (peras and apeiron), he will remain unable to show the internal connection between the collective, common interest of the city and the particular, individual natural desires and happiness of individual citizens. 3 In contrast to this second option, Thucydides reports that Pericles commended the laws of Athens for their",

      "abstract": "God, out of his goodness created humankind (Adam) in his own image and likeness, male and female he created them (Gen 1:27). God after creating them, he blessed them saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that move upon the earth” (Gen. 1:28). As mankind continued to live as was commanded, they turned inwards to subdue and dominate one another. Man against woman; village against village, town against town; state against state; region against region and worst of all tribe against tribe. This domination can come in the form of “stronger persons” dominating the “weaker ones,” “the stronger families” dominating “weaker families,” or “the stronger tribes” dominating “weaker tribes” etc. Jesus Christ when he came as God made man, he noticed these divisions among mankind hence on his last supper with his apostles he prayed, “That they may be one” (John.17: 11). He said it at the last supper to show how dear that unity is to his heart. St. Paul in trying to re-echo Jesus’ teaching among the Corinthians says, “Has Christ been divided?” (1Cor1:13). Whenever you gather among yourselves as Christians, there should be neither Jew nor Gentile, male or female, you are all one before God (Gal 3:28).The story of Good Samaritan is one of the ways through which Christ tried to tell us that we ought to look at one another fundamentally as image and likeness of God. The presence among Christians of tribal sentiments and loyalty to one’s ethnic group must be a scandal of great proportion to all of us who claim to be the agents for spreading Christ’s kingdom of love, and brotherhood in the world. Since we are now the authentic image of God, there ought not to be any form of division among us.",

In addition to these cognitive judgments, divine attributions and GTG were linked with desire: wanting to see God as a cause. Relationally, GTG was associated with seeing God's intentions as positive (trying to help, love, comfort, encourage, or protect), with actually feeling loved, cherished, valued, or appreciated by God in response, and with seeing the event as a divine gift – a perception more likely when people saw God as a gift-giver: giving gifts often to many people, including themselves.",

But in fact today, instead of being God's representative, humans create various chaos, both in their relationships with fellow humans—violence, brawl, bullying—and their relationship with the universe—garbage, air pollution, damage to marine ecosystems, water pollution, forest fires and so on. And the bad news is, Indonesia is included in the 5 countries with the most population in the world, so the habits of the Indonesian greatly influence world conditions. It seems that the various bad conditions that occur are the result of human actions who do not have good morals, this shows that the ongoing education system has not been able to lead humans to have the awareness that everything in the universe is related to one another, especially connection with God—or better known as Cosmology, or if it is compared to one body, when one limb is injured then the whole body feels the impact.

The research method used is descriptive qualitative, which has the primary source from Sachiko Murata's book The Tao of Islam, while the data collection technique uses literature study, and the data collected is analyzed using processing, categorization and interpretation. The results of this study are (1) God is viewed in two perspectives (duality), tanzih (incommensurability) and tasybih (likeness). To know God, Murata uses the tasybih approach. Islamic cosmology aims to emphasize tauhid (the oneness of Allah), which is depicted in the form of a triangle, encompassing God, nature and man in every corner, so that there is unity and interrelation between all realities; (2) Child education in the perspective of Islamic cosmology according to Sachiko Murata, building divine awareness that God is not only about Himself who is far from the reach of creatures, but we can see God scattered throughout the horizon and soul.",

      "title": "Properties",
      "abstract": "Asked to describe a given tomato, you might cite its redness, its size, and its age. In doing so, some philosophers would claim, you have cited some of the tomato’s properties. A property is what is variously called a feature, quality, attribute, or (as some philosophers put it) a way that something is. A property is supposed to be an entity that things (including particulars, such as tomatoes or people) have. The topic of properties is part of ontology (the study of what there is). The topic involves two key issues. The first issue concerns the nature of properties. That is, it concerns what sorts of entities properties are. One important question here is whether properties are located in space and time. Some philosophers follow Plato in thinking that properties are located in neither space nor time. Others follow Aristotle in thinking that properties are located in space and time. Another question is whether distinct individuals can literally have one and the same property. The view that they can takes properties to be repeatable entities, or universals. A rival view takes properties to be non-repeatable entities, or particulars. The second issue concerns the existence of properties. Given a view about the nature of properties – a view about what properties are supposed to be – there is then an issue about whether there are any such entities. The traditional debate typically took properties to be universals. Realists about universals argued that universals exist, whereas Nominalists argued that they do not. With greater recognition emerging during the last century of other ways of thinking of properties, the debate about the existence of properties has become many-sided. Philosophers who agree both about what properties are, and that properties so understood exist, may find other grounds for disagreement. This raises a subsidiary class of issues. For instance, do particulars exist in addition to properties? A given apple is edible, sweet to taste, and so on. Some philosophers argue that the apple is only a ‘bundle’ of these and other properties. Other philosophers disagree, and take the apple to be a ‘bare particular’ which has various properties, but is distinct from them. Other disagreements concern which properties exist, and how to classify them. For instance, is there a genuine distinction between so-called primary and secondary qualities? Again, is there a genuine distinction between so-called dispositional and non-dispositional (or categorical) properties?",

People abnegate part of their agency regularly; for example, this is done within hierarchical institutions. In other times, the self-abnegation is all-encompassing; for example, this happens to victims of brainwashing. An agent in such a position can completely fail to understand herself or be understood as having a self. This can arise from internal and external forces. After describing the features of self-abnegation, Wieland concludes by considering whether the self-abnegated person is owed respect. Should a person be treated as if her reasons and narratives were her own even though they are derived from the will of another? Are we obligated to cultivate self-affirmation in the self-abnegating agent?",

      "title": "On the Structure of Personality",
      "abstract": "1. In order to treat the various problems concerning personality, it may be convenient to consider that the personality consists of the three parts listed below. (cf. Fig 1).(1) Role-action: The exterior sphere of personality, which is altered in accordance with the given status-role, and not to be taken as an expression of the \"inner need-dispositions\". The significance of this conception has been emphasized by LINTON, PARSONS and others. (This term is here adopted from KLUCKHOHN and MURRAY).(2) Core-peripheral personality: The second sphere and an aggregate of specific attitudes, which vary in accordance with the given situation and object.(3) Core-nucleus personality: The central part of personality, constructed by general attitudes as the keynote of personality.2. Thus the personality of a person, as soon as he has secured a new status, changes according to the following process: at first only his role-action is successfully conformed to the given status-role, but, when repeated, this role-action is gradually internalized and becomes a specific attitude; then, when this new specific attitude is dominant and repeated, it is inwardly generalized and turns further into general attitude, which means that the core-nucl. personality undergoes a change. Thus so much time is taken for the influence of the new status-role to diffuse into the core-nucl. personality, that this central part of the mind, which was formed during childhood, remains almost unchanged through life. This fact is especially important in examining the influence of any sudden culture-change, for generally in such cases the influence is limited only to the outer two. spheres (e. g. a mode of the post-war democratization of the Japanese people).3. Concerning problems of personality-measurement, it must be noted that only a few methods can really diagnose the core-nucl. personality. It is, for example, often the case that by \"observation\" it is possible only to understand role-actions and that an \"attitude test\" can only touch the core-periph. personality, and even the result of the \"projective tests\", such as the Rorschach Test or TAT, can only reflect these two outer spheres.",

And the second hypothesis was; there’s any influence of motivation toward the gratifications of the audience of cinema “Para Pencari Tuhan” at majelis taklim al-Amin in sub-district Mekarsari. This research based on the theory of uses and gratifications model. Uses and gratifications model explain about the audience, who always active using the media for get any needs. In this research, researcher used interview, documentation, and questioner for got many data. And for the analysis, reseacher used product moment formula to test the hypothesis. From the research, researcher got any result that there was an influnce of motivation toward the gratifications of the audience of cinema Para Pencari Tuhan in sub-district Mekarsari, but it didn’t significant. From the research we could take any conclusion and that is “the audience are always active using the media, they are not passive just like we know in others theory, such as bullet theory and hypodermic model. But not all of them really realize about media, sometimes it depends on how they put the media in the different way in their social structure, each other have a different perception.

      "title": "Moral Psychophysics",
      "abstract": "In a typical Michotte billiard ball display, one ball moves and then stops next to a second ball, which then moves. In such displays, people can't help but see the first ball causally launch the second. In an analogous fashion, certain types of object motion (e.g. 'chasing', stopping and starting) irresistibly induce the perception of animacy (Scholl & Tremoulet 2000, Trends in Cognitive Sciences). Here we investigate whether perceived causality and animacy influence moral intuitions (blame, moral character). Participants saw two objects move around in an animate, self-propelled manner, then stop some distance apart. Next, the objects interacted either causally (e.g., launching), or non-causally (e.g. the second object moved before the first could hit it). In all conditions, the second object then happened to get trapped inside a container and 'tried to get out'. We reasoned that the first object should appear responsible for this negative outcome after a causal interaction, but less so after a non-causal interaction, during which the second object should appear to move intentionally rather than against its will. We found that moral judgments varied across 7 different object interactions (N = 375 between-subject design, p < .001), and these judgments correlated with intentionality ratings for the second object (R2 = 0.82, p = .004). When the objects interacted without initially moving animately then moral judgments were less severe (N = 919, p < .001), yet the basic pattern of moral judgments across conditions was similar for inanimate and animate trials (p = .412). We also found similar effects when participants read a verbal narrative (typical of moral psychology studies) accompanied by real-world objects interacting causally vs. non-causally (N = 194, p = .033). Thus, basic principles of perception can influence social judgments, stretching current notions of what vision is 'for'. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2016",

      "title": "On the Metaphysical Basis of Toleration",
      "abstract": "On the Metaphysical Basis of Toleration Walter Bagehot (bio) The most ancient conception of a State is that of a “religious partnership,” in which any member may by his acts bring down the wrath of the gods on the other members, and, so to speak, on the whole company. This danger was, in the conception of the time, at once unlimited and inherited; in any generation, partners A, C, D, etc., might suffer loss of life, or health, or goods—the whole association even might perish, because in a past generation the ancestors of Z had somehow offended the gods. Thus the historian of Athens tells us that after a particular act of sacrilege—a breach of the local privileges of sanctuary—the perpetrators were compelled “to retire into banishment”; and that those who had died before the date he is speaking of were “disinterred and cast beyond the borders.” “Yet,” he adds, “their exile continuing, as it did, only for a time, was not held sufficient to expiate the impiety for which they have been condemned. The Alkmoônids, one of the most powerful families in Attica, long continued to be looked upon as a tainted race, and in cases of public calamity were liable to be singled out as having by their sacrilege drawn down the judgment of the gods upon their countrymen.”1 And as false opinions about the gods have almost always been thought to be peculiarly odious to them, the misbeliever, the “miscreant,” has been almost always thought to be likely not only to impair hereafter the salvation of himself and others in a future world, but also to bring on his neighbors and his nation grievous calamities immediately in this. He has been persecuted to stop political danger more than to arrest intellectual error. But it will be said: Put history aside, and come to things now. Why should not those who are convinced that certain doctrines are errors, that they are most dangerous, that they may ruin man’s welfare here and his salvation hereafter, use the power of the State to extirpate those errors? Experience seems to show that the power of the State can be put forth in that way effectually. Why, then, should it not be put forth? If I had room, I should like for a moment to criticise the word “effectually.” I should say that the State, in the cases where it is most wanted, is not of the use which is thought. I admit that it extirpates error, but I doubt if it creates belief—at least, if it does so in cases where the persecuted error is suitable to the place and time. In such cases, I think the effect has often been to eradicate a heresy among the few, at the cost of creating a skepticism among the many; to kill the error no doubt, but also to ruin the general belief. [End Page 187] And this is the cardinal point, for the propagation of the “truth” is the end of persecution; all else is only a means. But I have not space to discuss this, and will come to the main point. I say that the State power should not be used to arrest discussion, because the State power may be used equally for truth or error, for Mohammedanism or Christianity, for belief or no-belief, but in discussion truth has an advantage. Arguments always tell for truth as such, and against error as such; if you let the human mind alone, it has a preference for good argument over bad; it oftener takes truth than not. But if you do not let it alone, you give truth no advantage at all; you substitute a game of force, where all doctrines are equal, for a game of logic, where the truer have the better chance. The process by which truth wins in discussion is this,—certain strong and eager minds embrace original opinions, seldom all wrong, never quite true, but of a mixed sort, part truth, part error. These they inculcate on all occasions, and on every side, and gradually bring the cooler sort of men to a hearing of them. These...",

      "abstract": "The problem with trying to punish an institution that is judged to be \"delinquent\" – whether a \"rogue state,\" the United Nations (UN), Shell Oil, or the U.S. Army – might be understood as one of responding to an entity that (to invoke Edward, First Baron Thurlow's eighteenth-century account of the corporation) \"has no soul to be damned and no body to be kicked.\" Perhaps this seems a fairly obvious point. After all, even if one can draw some carefully qualified analogies between individual human actors and institutions (as I attempt to do in the first part of this chapter), the two types of entity are different in important ways. One might thereby conclude that the corporeal – and, depending on one's beliefs, even the spiritual – nature of individual human actors renders them vulnerable to forms of punitive harm to which institutions, in the sense of formal organizations, are simply impervious. Alternatively, one might maintain that such an observation has little relevance when we are talking about \"delinquent\" institutions in international relations. We do not, one might argue, need to be able to anthropomorphize formal organizations to be able to punish them. Indeed, we frequently justify actions toward states, multinational corporations, and intergovernmental organizations in terms of punishment, and these actions often serve successful deterrent, retributive, and even rehabilitative functions.",

      "title": "Loneliness: The Silent Killer",
      "abstract": "Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to everyone. It has no single and widespread cause. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of loneliness as a potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically from person to person. Notwithstanding the deleterious impact on quality of life and life satisfaction, loneliness has an equivalent risk factor to health as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day, thereby shortening one's life span by eight years. Humans can survive three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food—as told by survival lore—and three months without companionship. We are a social and gregarious people. People simply need people. Loneliness is a complicated emotion. Some people can feel lonely in a crowded room or feel content in solitude. A quick way to think about loneliness is this: It's the difference between how much social connection or interaction people want and how much they are getting. It is essential to acknowledge that these relationships should be important and positive. A few positive relationships are far better than a dozen negative interactions. Thus, it is a subjective feeling. Without that social connection, people often become depressed, which further feeds feelings of loneliness. Loneliness has been linked to higher rates of heart disease, alcohol and drug addition, violence, anxiety, depression, altered brain function, Alzheimer's disease progression, decreased memory and learning, increased stress levels, suicide, and even death. Loneliness is almost as prevalent as obesity and has shown to impact all aspects of quality of life. Loneliness causes people to feel empty, alone, and unwanted. Loneliness is clearly a public health concern. Over the past two decades, there has been a threefold increase in the number of Americans who say they have no close confidants. More than fifty-five million people in the US described themselves as lonely or socially isolated. One of our responses to COVID-19 is social distancing, where we stay six feet away from others. This is a misnomer. Don't we really mean physically distancing because we engage in phone conversations, email each other, attend Zoom meetings, and so on? Perhaps it is time for US institutions of higher education to follow one approach to combating loneliness used in the United Kingdom: appointing a minister of loneliness at the dean's level or above. Loneliness is a universal condition that affects all of us directly or through the people we know and love. A sad reality of modern life is that loneliness is pervasive and on the rise. In fact, since 1985, the number of people in the US who indicated they had no close friends has tripled. Loneliness has been found to be a serious impediment to flourishing while cultivating strong positive connections with people has been seen to bring meaning and well-being to individuals. Loneliness is also a strong predictor of poor health. To feel lonely is to experience a sense of being painfully disconnected, left out, and isolated, with no one to turn to for emotional and social support. Since the dawn of antiquity, we have been built to be social creatures. Across key demographics, younger generations are lonelier than older generations, men are lonelier than women, higher-income people are less lonely than those with lower incomes, and those living in urban and suburban communities are less lonely than those in rural areas. Department chairs are in an enviable position to address loneliness in their faculty and staff. Although COVID-19 has reduced in-person interactions, chairs can still be cognizant of how department members are relating to other faculty, staff, and students. Colleges are often equipped with resources and services such as group sessions, counseling, and workshops to proactively address many types of issues. One of the best ways that chairs can help with loneliness is to recognize that it is a very real possibility and to stay connected with faculty and staff via regular interactions with them. Perhaps Thomas Wolfe said it best in God's Lonely Man: “The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.” Robert E.

      "abstract": "In Korean shamanism ① the people's attitude towards the gods during the religious ceremonies and formalities isn't sincere or solemn. ② The shamans who perform the roles of gods and carrying out the ceremony are otherwise treated with contempt; outside the ceremony, they are treated as the lowest possible social class. ③ While performing the actual ritual, these shamans don't go to the gods, instead they call gods to come to their ground. ④ During the ceremony, gods most often appear in official uniforms which represent bureaucrats of the Chosun(Lee Dynasty) era. ⑤ During the ceremony, music, dance, plays and foods are always included; these are provided not only for the chief deities who are invited as the guests of honor but also the miscellaneous gods and the deads' souls. ⑥ In terms of the content of the ritual, 'kut', the act of sending away all gods who are gathered in the place of an exorcist is considered as important as the summoning of the gods, an act with includes inviting the gods, telling them the human-beings' entreaties and receiving the gods' answers in accordance with the dramatic scenarios. ⑦ The nature of the gods is not strictly polarized between good and evil, but rather, the gods all exhibit traits which may be both good and evil. Therefore, to understand these facts, first of all it should be kept in mind the fact that Korean shamanism is a religious and cultural phenomenon formed on the basis of realistic and humanistic thoughts and sense of value. The method of interaction between human beings and gods can be much more simply explained not in religious terms but in social or educational meanings. The way of dealing with gods produced by the shaman in kut shows the very way of Korean people's transaction with the government authority in this society through the past.",

      "title": "Substance, mode, and accident in modern philosophy",
      "abstract": "The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries inherited, and were witness to, the decline of the metaphysics of substance, mode, and accident of the Aristotelian tradition. The causes of this decline can be gleaned from an investigation of various puzzles which arose during the period, and of the ways in which different philosophers reacted to these puzzles. One such puzzle concerns independence. A substance is meant to be something that exists independently – but what meets this standard, other than God? Another puzzle concerns identity. A substance is meant to be something which in some sense supports (etymologically, stands under) its modes or accidents – but how can we penetrate to the nature, or identity, of the substance itself? A third puzzle concerns unity. A substance is meant to be unified in a way that a heap of stones is not – but what qualifies as a genuine unity? The puzzles were initially raised by those, such as Descartes and Locke, who did not intend for them to radically modify our understanding of substance, mode, and accident. But radical changes followed shortly thereafter nonetheless. Spinoza maintained that God or Nature is the only substance, all other things being mere modes of God. Conway, Leibniz, and Berkeley argued that the world is fundamentally spiritual or mind-like. And eventually, Hume and Kant questioned whether the notions of substance, mode, and accident were, in some sense, unavoidably problematic. As an investigation of this debate reveals, theories of substance, mode, and accident were intertwined with many other enduring philosophical themes, including the nature of reality, the mind–body relation, and the limits of human knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Whatever else it means, to see or be seen is to enter into a relationship, even if doing so involves practices as different as ignoring those who glare at us, returning the gaze of a lover, or cherishing the photograph of a lost family member. Different as they are, each of these behaviors is an example of the many kinds of relatedness that constitute interaction with images. I say \"interaction\" because it becomes clear upon inspection that a viewer's action toward objects, images, or people is often far more than unilateral. Each looks back; sometimes they even see us before we see them. Of special interest here is how images of the living and the dead, of gods, or of mythic heroes connect to the viewer's body. Seeing bridges the gap separating seer and seen, connecting the two in some way. Representation vanishes in the way that a tool in one's hand fades from consciousness as a sign in the midst of using it. Before use, the tool only signifies what it might actually do. In use, the tool ceases to be separate from the body and becomes instead a physical extension of it. Likewise, when they join viewers to those they love, fear, or hate, images are organic projections of the eyes, material forms of beholding. It is this tangible look, the look of the sacred, that reveals the role of the body in vision, and that will be the subject of this chapter.",

It focuses on the value and harm of death, asking what makes an animal’s life worth living; what, if anything, makes death bad (or good) for animals; what factors contribute to how bad it is; and what facts about shelters are relevant to our decision-making when considering saving lives and euthanasia. The chapter reviews three views of the harm of death: death as a deprivation, death as thwarting desires, and death as interrupting a narrative. It argues for the superiority of the deprivation view, on the grounds that it best accounts for the judgment that death is bad for animals while making sense of whether and when it is better for some animals in shelters to be killed than allowed to suffer.",

What is required is a replacement of the ‘me’ as an action center. For even if I will the good, even if I will God, the seducing power of the ‘I’ who wills so lofty a thing remains. The trouble with the ideas of self-realization and self-actualization from a Calvinistic perspective is that they are self-propelled activities emanating from a center called ‘I’ or ‘Self.’ They imply continuity of Self in the process of time, whereas the Calvinist (and in the wider sense all Christians) demand a discontinuity of self.”",

      "title": "Splash - Eye movements during unexpected material behaviors",
      "abstract": "To anticipate sudden actions in our environment is an important ability based on prior knowledge and experience. Anticipation and prediction allow the visual oculomotor system to reduce inherent sensory processing delays and to produce eye movements to the right location at the right time to optimize sampling of visual information. Most events follow predictable patterns in space and time, but not everything is predictable. Over our lifetime we have learned, what to expect when objects made from different material are exposed to different forces (Alley et al., 2020). But how does visual sampling behavior change if the associations of material properties are violated? We compare eye movements of 14 observers while watching movies which showed eight familiar everyday objects (e.g., chair or teacup) falling from a fixed distance to the ground floor in a virtual room. Upon impact, objects showed either expected or surprising material deformations. For example, a falling chair could tip over but stay solid (expected) or it could splash like milk into little droplets and splatter on the ground (surprising). To test the effect of context cues, and therefore the strength of expectations about an object’s material properties, objects either appeared with the look of their typical optical material properties (rendered) in a natural room or as white high contrast shapes in front of a black background. We found that in the surprise-condition eye movement patterns deviated systematically: after the impact initial fixations were shorter but the next fixations were prolonged and located closer to the object center compared to the fixation pattern of the expected condition. This effect on fixation behavior was stronger for the rendered objects. Therefore, when confronted with unexpected material behavior eye movement strategies are rapidly adapted to maximize information about the material behavior of the object.",

But to be embodied is to be innocent not guilty, and the sexual conjunction of bodies celebrates this innocence in the play of paradise. It is these truths about the human condition that our own age has rediscovered; Eros, demonized for so long, is again found to be a god who bestows on his devotees the bliss of participation in his own divinity. We are now at last at home with our bodies, we are no longer ashamed of them. And we are no longer ashamed to speak of that which so intimately concerns our bodies. Sexual liberation is also (or even primarily) the liberation of speech. What was formerly unsayable can now be spoken freely, without fear or shame.",

      "title": "Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders",
      "abstract": "Ramazzini's De Morbis Artificum Diatriba (Diseases of workers),1 published in 1700, has been described as a contribution to the development of occupational health as important as the contributions of what Vesalius' work to anatomy and Morgagni's to pathology.2 Bernardino Ramazzini (1633–1714) went beyond the study of usual health problems of his time (typhoid, smallpox, and plague),3 describing instead the health problems suffered by workers in particular occupations.4 Furthermore, Ramazzini understood that occupation hazards were not limited to exposure to chemicals (such as mineral dusts, organic particles, and vapors inhaled through the lungs or absorbed through the skin) or physical agents (such as noise, heat, cold, and humidity) but also included the effects of awkward body positions and movements: \"...the cause I ascribe to certain violent and irregular motions and unnatural posture of the body, by reason of which the natural structure of the vital machine is so impaired that serious diseases gradually develop therefrom\" (Chapter I - Diseases to which miners of metal are exposed) and the maintenance of prolonged stationary postures or postures requiring heavy exertion: \"I now wish to turn to other workers in whom certain morbid affections gradually arise from other causes, ie, from some particular posture of the limbs or unnatural movements of the body called for while they work\" (Chapter XXX - Diseases of those who work standing). Ramazzini understood how posture, repetition of movements, weight lifting, and muscular load could contribute to certain disorders (sciatica, gibbus, valgoid condition, hernia, pain in different parts of the body, fatigue, arthritis, paralysis, lameness, shoulder dislocation, and muscular tension). This allowed him not only to describe the anatomic site of the health problem, but also to identify intensity and duration of the risk factor in diverse occupations (Table).TABLE: Occupations at Risk of Musculoskeletal Disorders, According to Ramazzini's De Morbis Artificum Diatriba 1Ramazzini observed that biomechanical overload and awkward postures caused disabilities in miners, and that musculoskeletal stress is a major cause of disease among potters, \"who sit at the wheel and turn it to shape the vessels...from excessive fatigue of the feet they are often subject to sciatica\" (Chapter V - Diseases of potters) and in porters, \"whose work is indispensable for loading and unloading merchandise from the cargo-ships...From carrying huge weights on their shoulders they too often suffer from various and even very serious diseases...the dorsal vertebral are constantly bent forward and become set in that position\" (Chapter XXXV - Diseases of porters). Prolonged stationary posture was associated with fatigue in pressmen, who \"have to stand incessantly at work...is very fatiguing, for almost the whole body must be exerted in such a task; hence these workmen inevitably suffer from lassitude and intense fatigue\" (Supplementum - Chapter I - Diseases of printers). Ramazzini observed that standing \"even for a short time, proves so exhausting compared with walking and running, though it be for a long time\" (Chapter XXX - Diseases of those who work standing) and proposed a pathophysiological mechanism to explain the observation: \"It is generally supposed that this is because of the tonic movement of all the antagonist muscles, both extensors and flexors, which have to be continually in action to enable a man to keep standing erect\" (Chapter XXX - Diseases of those who work standing). Clinical consequences of unnatural postures are also described for sedentary workers \"who...while they work at their job, become bent, hump-backed, and hold their heads down like people looking for something on the ground...\" (Chapter XXX - Sedentary workers and their diseases) In particular, \"Tailors...often subject to numbness of the legs, lameness, and sciatica, because while they are sewing garments they are almost of necessity obliged to keep one of the legs back against the thigh\" (Chapter XXXI - Sedentary workers and their diseases). Ramazzini observed health disorders in writers and notaries: \"the maladies that afflict the clerks aforesaid arise...from constant sitting...the incessant movement of the hand and always in the same direction\" (Supplementum - Chapter II - Diseases of scribes and notaries) and concluded that the muscular overload of the arm led to a progressive impairment of the function: \"...incessant driving of the pen over paper causes intense fatigue of the hand and the whole arm because of the continuous and almost tonic strain on the muscles and tendons, which in course of time results in failure of power in the right hand\" (Supplementum - Chapter II - Diseases of scribes and notaries). In these workers Ramazzini recognized the potential for psychologic stress: \"the strain on the mind from the effort not to disfigure the books by errors or cause loss to their employers when they add, subtract, or do other sums in arithmetic)\" (Supplementum - Chapter II - Diseases of scribes and notaries). Ramazzini felt the need to provide workers with advice and recommendations advising the patient to limit himself, to be moderate and to avoid risks: \"Therefore in work so taxing, moderation would be the best safeguard against these maladies...; for the common maxim \"Nothing to excess\" is one that I excessively approve...\" (Supplementum - Chapter IV - Diseases of weavers), to limit the working activity: \"...we must advise men employed in the standing trades to interrupt when they can that too prolonged posture by sitting or walking about or exercising the body in some way\" (Chapter XXX, Diseases of those who work standing), and to do physical exercise: \"They should be advised to take physical exercise...to some extent counteract the harm done by many days of sedentary life\" (Chapter XXXI - Sedentary workers and their diseases). In light of the recent increase of musculoskeletal disorders, representing a major cause of lost time from work, workers' disability, compensation claims and health care costs,5 it is appropriate to recall the lessons of Ramazzini. He anticipated the utility of epidemiology for discovering health problems, investigated the working environment to improve it, and provided workers with sound hygienic measures—sound even from the perspective of modern occupational health.",

      "abstract": "The usual lazy and short way by chastisement and the rod, which is the only instrument of government that tutors generally know, or even think of, is the most unfit of any to be used in education, because it tends to both these mischiefs. First, this kind of punishment contributes not at all to the mastery of our natural propensity to indulge corporal and present pleasure, and to avoid pain at any rate, but rather encourages it, and thereby strengthens that in us which is the root from whence spring all vicious actions and the irregularities of life. Secondly, this sort of correction naturally breeds an aversion to that which it is the tutor's business to create a liking to ... Thirdly, such a sort of slavish discipli e makes a slavish temper. The child submits, and dissembles obedience, whilst the fear of the rod hangs over him. But when that is removed, and by being out of sight, he can promise himself impunity, he gives the greater scope to his natural inclination; which by this way is not at all altered, but, on the contrary, heightened and increased in him; and after such restraint breaks out usually with the more violence. Or, fourthly, if severity carried to the highest pitch does prevail and works a cure on the present unruly distemper, it often brings in the room of it a worse and more dangerous disease, by breaking the mind; and then in the place of a disorderly young fellow, you have a low-spirited moped creature, who, however with his unnatural sobriety he may please silly people who commend tame and inactive children because they make no noise nor give them any trouble, yet at last will probably prove as uncomfortable a thing to his friends as he will be all his life a useless thing to himself and others.",

      "title": "Lo cortés no quita lo valiente: una comparación de la cortesía en Quito y Salamanca",
      "abstract": "La cortesia es uno de los pilares fundamentales de la comunicacion humana. La forma en la que preguntamos, pedimos cosas, agradecemos, saludamos, nos dirigimos a los demas, etc. denotan no solo nuestro grado de educacion, sino tambien rasgos propios de nuestra lengua y de nuestra cultura. Las lenguas, todas, sin excepcion, tienen, dentro de si recursos que se usan para agradar al otro, o para proteger la imagen del que las emite. No nos cabe duda de que el rol de la cortesia es promover una convivencia civilizada y amable con nuestros congeneres. No importa si esa cortesia es falsa o sincera, actua como una especie de valvula de seguridad en cualquier situacion.\nBrown y Levinson (1987) distinguen dos tipos de cortesia: positiva y cortesia negativa. La primera tiene que ver con la imagen positiva que el hablante tiene de si mismo y que aspira que sea respetada y aceptada por los demas. La segunda, en cambio, se refiere al deseo de cada individuo de que sus actos no se vean impedidos por otros. En esta investigacion se van a analizar 6 aspectos de la cortesia: los pedidos, las disculpas, las respuestas al cumplido, las criticas, el turno de palabra y el espacio interpersonal. Con respecto al tema de los pedidos, que es el tema central esta investigacion, las estrategias indirectas entrarian en lo que se considera cortesia negativa. Por el contrario, las directas se corresponden con la cortesia positiva.\nHaverkate (1994) senala que la interaccion social, en general, y la verbal, en especial, exigen que las imagenes positiva y negativa sean respetadas desarrollando apropiadas estrategias de cortesia. Asimismo, considera conveniente una sustitucion de terminos: solidaridad en lugar de cortesia positiva y distanciamiento en lugar de cortesia negativa. Estos nuevos terminos nos darian a entender que cuando somos directos nos ponemos en el lugar del otro, a su mismo nivel. Por otro lado, los que son indirectos se alejan de su interlocutor, esto no significaria creerse superior, o inferior, solamente limita la confianza. De acuerdo a Haverkate (1994), al menos parte de las culturas del mundo se dividirian en esas dos clases. Teniendo como base el criterio de que los representantes de unas culturas muestran preferencia por la expresion de cortesia de solidaridad, en tanto que los representantes de otras conceden valor especifico a la expresion de cortesia de distanciamiento. Eso querria decir que culturas similares usarian las mismas estrategias de cortesia. Al parecer, eso se cumpliria. No olvidemos que lengua y cultura estan fuertemente relacionadas. Pero, ?podriamos decir que los sudafricanos y los canadienses, por compartir una misma lengua, comparten cultura?, ?podemos hablar de una unica cultura anglosajona? ?Es legitimo poner a todos los usuarios del ingles en un mismo saco cultural? De igual modo, ?seria valido creer en la unicidad de la cultura hispana? Espanoles e hispanoamericanos con las mismas creencias, comportamientos, etc.\nDefinitivamente no. El uso de la cortesia en espanol no es homogeneo. Aunque la lengua, internamente, tiene los mismos recursos linguisticos, el espanol peninsular y el espanol americano se diferencian al momento de ponerlos en practica. Visto de ese modo, espanoles e hispanoamericanos deberiamos usar diferentes estrategias al momento de expresar cortesia. Aparentemente, los espanoles poseen caracteristicas de cortesia positiva, o solidaria. Son mas directos al momento de hacer pedidos, por ejemplo. Un gran numero de latinoamericanos, por el contrario, usaria cortesia negativa, somos mas distantes, o indirectos. Este trabajo tratara de desmontar, o ratificar, la idea de que los latinoamericanos usamos diferentes estrategias de cortesia que los espanoles. Eso si, es necesario dejar muy claro que al decir Espana e Hispanoamerica, en este caso, nos estamos refiriendo a un sector minusculo de Espana: Salamanca; y a un sector infimo de Hispanoamerica: Ecuador, mas concretamente, Quito. Y mucho mas especificamente, estudiantes de la USAL (Universidad de Salamanca) y de la PUCE (Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador). El sentido de esta investigacion no es de ninguna manera mostrar la cortesia/descortesia de uno de los dos grupos, se trata mas bien de encontrar lo que nos une, mas que lo que nos separa. Si bien es cierto, desde algunos sectores, sobre todo, el lado anglosajon, siempre se ha considerado la cortesia negativa como mas cortes, (valga la redundancia), desde ningun punto de vista ese es el pensamiento que guia este estudio. Basandose en algunos estudios, se ha llegado a la conclusion de que en las culturas mediterraneas: griega, espanola, italiana, etc. predomina la cortesia positiva. Por el contrario, en las culturas anglosajonas predomina la negativa, al igual que en algunos sectores latinoamericanos. Ante todo esto, vale preguntarnos ?cuan valido es hacer un estudio comparativo de cortesia verbal entre usuarios de la misma lengua? Nos parece que es muy relevante. Es necesario seguirnos descubriendo y acercando. Estudios como este nos ayudan a entendernos mejor y, sobre todo, a aceptarnos mas.\n Si bien el tratamiento del pedido abarca casi la totalidad de esta investigacion, tambien nos hemos ocupado de incluir otros aspectos de la cortesia, como son la prosemica, la respuesta al cumplido, la critica, el turno de palabra y las disculpas.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: CORTESIA, RELEVANCIA, ACTOS CONTRA LA IMAGEN, CORTESIA POSITIVA, CORTESIA NEGATIVA, PROXEMICA, CONFIANZA.",

      "title": "SPIRITUAL URGENCY OF RELIGIOUS AND EXPENSES OF EVIDENCE IN COMBATING CORRUPTION IN INDONESIA",
      "abstract": "In 1950 - an A Psychologist Erich Fromm says about the most basic things, which should grasp man in her life. In his formulation, that humans have a life orientation that focuses on attaining human qualities (being oriented). Life should not be obsessed just want to reach the attributes of life, such as job title, wealth, or position in the social strata (having oriented). The sudden rise to the surface of the case - a case of corruption involving officials of Law Enforcement and Public Officials, giving an indication that the authority and power, provide opportunities for corruption. The eradication of corruption, must be done comprehensively, because corruption is an extraordinary crime. Eradication of corruption should start from the stage of the prevention / preventive measures, namely the one with the religious spiritual practice. As for the law enforcement phase / repressive measures, that the burden of proof in the trial in court, should be borne by the defendant, and no longer charged to the prosecutor. Prosecutors just enough to make the accusation that the defendant committed the crime of corruption, and it is the defendant who must prove that the defendant is not guilty of corruption .It is called the burden of proof is reversed. Reversal system of the burden of proof, is one way, which can contribute to reduce the number of perpetrators of corruption. During this time, prosecutors had to fight to prove the charges. While the defendant has the right to prove that the property is acquired not from corruption. Because it is only a right and not an obligation, then the defendant can not conduct verification or proof. Therefore, it is necessary juridical changes in the procedural law of evidence for corruption, namely that the burden of proof should and must be done by the defendant, no longer by the Attorney. Based on the description above, there are two (2) issues to be discussed are: 1) How do I make an effort - preventive efforts in the prevention of corruption in Indonesia? and 2) Is the burden of proof reversed, will be able to contribute in reducing the number of perpetrators of corruption in Indonesia?. By discussing the two (2) to these problems, are expected to provide a way out, in efforts to prevent and eradicate corruption in Indonesia, making Indonesia free of corruption is expected by 2020.

      "title": "Ten Things People Ought to Know About Skin",
      "abstract": "BIGGER THAN A BREAD BOX. The skin is the largest organ of the body. When it’s stretched out, the skin of a typical person encompasses approximately 2 square meters. On average, skin accounts for approximately 15% of an individual’s body weight (approximately 8–9 lbs). Commonly, an adult has more than 300 million skin cells, which collectively contain more than 11 miles of blood vessels. A VITAL ROLE. Skin does more than help make people look presentable. For example, it plays a key role in the body’s ability to detect hot and cold. It also helps individuals regulate their body temperature. In addition, it helps protect the muscles, bones, and internal organs from outside infection and disease by exuding antibacterial substances. Furthermore, it acts as a waterproof, insulating shield that guards the body against damaging sunlight and harmful chemicals. SIMILAR, BUT DIFFERENT. Not all skin is alike. For example, depending on where it is located on the body, skin varies in thickness. The thinnest skin is found on the eyelids, whereas the thickest skin is found on the bottom of the feet. Skin also differs in color. Skin color is the result of a protein called melanin, a pigment the body produces in the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) to protect individuals from the potentially cancer-causing ultraviolet rays of the sun. Dark-skinned people produce more numerous and deeper colored melanin particles. Vice versa for lighter skinned individuals. MOVE TO IMPROVE. Exercising on a regular basis can help individuals have healthy skin. By increasing blood flow, exercise can help nourish skin cells and keep them vital. Not only does blood carry oxygen and nutrients to working cells throughout the body, including the skin, it also helps carry away waste products. DON’T BLAME CHOCOLATE. Very little evidence exists to suggest that chocolate causes acne. In reality, the two primary foods that cause acne are dairy and sugar. Both alter the body’s hormonal levels and blood sugar balance. This situation leads to oily skin and plugged pores, resulting in inflammation and pimples. WORSE THAN SMOKING. Somewhat shocking, more people develop skin cancer because of tanning than develop lung cancer because of smoking. In fact, more than 90% of skin cancer is caused by exposure to the sun. Skin cancer is the number one cancer diagnosis in the United States — more common than all breast, lung, and prostate cancers combined. As such, every hour, one person dies from this insidious disease. A NATURAL PROCESS. A number of factors cause a person’s skin to age. Some of these factors are beyond the control of an individual; others aren’t. Among the things that a person can’t do anything about is the natural aging process. For example, most people, in time, will get visible lines on their faces. Over time, their skin also will become thinner and drier. On the other hand, individuals can make certain environmental and lifestyle choices that can help slow the premature aging of their skin, e.g., exercise; eat a healthy, well-balanced diet; avoid smoking; protect the skin from the sun; etc. JUST LIKE THE REAL THING. During the late 1970s, medical researchers developed a substitute for human skin that was designed to save the lives of severely burned patients and individuals who experienced extreme cases of skin disease. Although the first choice may be to use a graft of a person’s skin if the necessary amount of skin is available from another place on the person’s body, such an option does not always exist and is not always the most appropriate path forward. EARLY WARNING SIGN. When a person experiences changes in their skin, ranging from discoloration to new growth, these changes may (but not necessarily) be early signs of more serious, underlying health problems. For example, a yellowing of the skin may be a sign of liver failure. A darkening of the skin could be a signal of hormonal disease, such as Addison disease. New growths on the skin could be an indication of skin cancer. Changes in the coloration or shape of nails could be a sign of organ system issues. EARLY WARNING SIGN. Every minute, a person’s body sheds more than 30,000 to 40,000 dead skin cells. In fact, every 27 to 28 days, the skin renews itself. Some estimates suggest that more than half of the dust in a person’s home is actually dead skin. The earth’s atmosphere also is unscathed by the onslaught of dust comprised of dead skin, with over a billion tons of such dust in the world’s ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Massive-nodular and crystal-faced gemstones; humanity has been used as a sign of embellishment and social status since the earliest periods of history because of its unique color, figure appearance and physico-chemical properties which are mineralogical phenomena, but also by means of magical meanings, war tool 'and healing have been used as' means of manipulation of positive events' such as peace, happiness, blessing. Indeed, the lapidary and jewelries mounted gems, in the first man, began in the form of amulet beads (rounded and internally perforated objects) for both earthly and spiritual purposes. Therefore, the use of these stones serving purposes such as religion, amulet, magic and lucky charm, the dead gift, god presentation, concession and class indicator, social status and marital status indicator, tribal marking tool, symbolic communication tool, of course, served for purposes such as ornamentation that preserved its validity both in the past and today. Another important function that still maintains its validity is beliefs, which include the prevention of bad eyes, defeating the existing evils, the aim of increasing the quality of life materially / spiritually and physically. In this study, applications and recommendations for the use of some sample stones in ancient and medieval times for the purpose of charm-protective-healing-therapy will be considered in the category of traditional complementary medicine in public health. However, besides the basic principles and predictions of the science of gemology that investigate how the gemstones are formed, their physical and chemical properties, this study also contains important determinations that the unconscious use of these stones for protection and / or remediation may cause significant damage.

One defines original sin as inherited lawlessness or vice effected in the loins of that first parent, committed by the rebellion of all men who from Adam have been generated in the natural way. The form of original sin exists in that lawlessness and disobedience whereby all have sinned with Adam who were in him by virtue of a 'seminal relation'.

      "abstract": "The famous monologue from Shakespeare's As You Like It, from which the title of this contribution is taken, likens the world to a stage and life to a play. The seven stages of man's life are vividly evoked and have resonance today, even as we view the effects of alcohol consumption on the individual across the life course. First we see the infant ‘mewling and puking in his nurse's arms’, then the child ‘creeping like snail unwillingly to school’. The lover (or modern day adolescent) ‘sighing like a furnace’ gives way to the soldier (or young adult) ‘sudden and quick in quarrel’. The ‘justice’ (modern day adult) is ‘full of wise saws and modern instances’ and ‘so plays his part’. With the arrival of the sixth age, we see the older man shrinking in stature. Finally the dying man is again like a child: ‘sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything’.\n\nAlcohol-related brain damage is a heterogeneous condition. There is no single causal mechanism. Alcohol and its metabolite acetaldehyde have a direct neurotoxic effect on the brain. Repeated episodes of intoxication and withdrawal, dietary neglect and thiamine and other vitamin deficiencies, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular events and alcoholic liver disease also contribute to impairment in brain structure and function. These direct and indirect effects of alcohol interact in the individual, such that no two people drinking the same amount of alcohol develop the same patterns of damage. Individual susceptibility is influenced by prenatal exposure to alcohol, age, gender, genetic predisposition (Guerrini et al ., in this issue), general health, social inequalities and other metabolic influences.\n\nAlcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) manifests itself in different ways across the lifespan. In the developing fetal brain, neuronal and glial cells divide rapidly to the extent that they total ∼2 billion in number by …",

Both mechanisms are accompanied by anxiety and an urge to escape or attack. The individual's lifestyle, which is the result of interaction between his innate qualities and life experiences, determines whether he will attempt to deal with threats, his fear and/or anger, and the resulting anxiety in an objective or pathological manner. This formulation underscores the need to learn methods of coping with anger and fear from early childhood, so that they do not develop into pathological behavior patterns.",

      "title": "What's in a name? Accidents or injuries?",
      "abstract": "An occupational accident is an unpleasant “event” which occurs unexpectedly and causes injury or damage. Accident also denotes a range of different phenomena such as fate, coincidence, luck, misfortune and thus is a vague term. The word injury means a harm, wound or trauma done to a person9s body. Our aim is to highlight the somewhat erroneous use of the word “accident” instead of injury. Methodically it is important to know what are we measuring? In case of occupational diseases a cogent distinction is globally accepted. Exposure measures are not disease measures. Similarly, an accident statistic is not necessarily an injury statistic. In medieval times, Black Death was a phenomenon that was poorly understood and was explained as punishment for our sins. However, modern science distinguished between the cause (Y. Pestis) and the outcome (Bubonic Plague) and measures to prevent the outcome followed. History shows that successful prevention mandates a demarcation between the preceding event and the following outcome. An occupational car accident implies both event and injury. The extent of the injury is a result of the car crash which could be restricted by airbags. Isolation of the event (car crash) and the outcome (injury) is therefore critical to prevention technologies. All potential causes of the injury may be impossible to eliminate, but the outcome could be modified by targeted interventions. “Incident” is perhaps a precise term instead of accident for epidemiological applications. Regardless, if the word accident is indispensible, we recommend a more appraised use of the words accident and injury in epidemiology.",

      "title": "Multiple object handling: strategies for cumulative grasping and transport with a single hand",
      "abstract": "Humans can cumulatively grasp multiple objects and then transport them using a single hand (e.g., when clearing up tableware). This skill, which we refer to as ‘multiple object handling’, helps minimise the number of actions required to transport objects. However, it also presents unique challenges for the sensorimotor system, including the use of grips other than finger-thumb opposition (which is almost always used for grasping single objects). In the present work we explored the strategies used for multiple object handling, particularly focussing on object selection and grip choice. Participants were presented with pairs of objects, asked to grasp one of them and then, without placing that object down, grasp the second object and transport both to a designated location. We examined the order in which participants selected objects, as well as the grips used for grasping and holding them, enabling us to describe a typical approach to multiple object handling. When two objects are grasped cumulatively for transport, finger-thumb opposition is almost always used to grasp the first object, which is then frequently held using an atypical grip (e.g., finger-finger or finger-palm opposition). Finger-thumb opposition can then be used once again to grasp a subsequent object. Grasping objects that are smaller or with lower surface area first may facilitate this approach. This work provides insight into a technique commonly used for efficient object transport. Furthermore, it highlights how an extensive range of atypical grips can be used by humans, broadening understanding of our capacity for dextrous motor control.",

Men love life too much and everything around them confirms them in this love. The enticing image of pleasure and hope, that sweetest snare of mortals, for which they will gulp down great draughts of evil if it is mixed with a few drops of delight, is too alluring for there to be any need to fear that the necessary impossibility of punishing such a crime will have any influence on men.

Many theories view property from the psychological perspective of the owner, describing how property enables an owner to create or present a self to the world, to enjoy a zone of liberty, to acquire the confidence to participate in politics or economic activities, among other matters. This paper, however, takes particular interest in the psychological states associated with the non-owner — the person who confronts the property of others. Some theorists have described property as a “hawk/dove” or “chicken” game, in which the non-owner takes a dove role, implicitly from fear. This paper argues, however, that the non-owner’s respect for property cannot be explained adequately by fear. Respect for the property of others emerges as a somewhat mysterious psychological state from the point of view of rational actors, but it is nevertheless critical for supporting the institution of property.",

      "title": "The Pot Calling the Kettle &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot;",
      "abstract": "The world of performance provides a space in which to theorize and reflect upon identity. Traditionally, \"blackness\" has been susceptible to the identity politics circulating within the particular historical context of its representation on and off the stage. On the proscenium stage that was the auction block, for example, there was no question in the auctioneer or the buyer's mind that blackness was sutured to the phenotypical black body. That particular \"opening\" on the auction block was a command performance of blackness. The subversive, coded performances of the slave in the presence of slaveholders, on the other hand (i.e., spirituals, signifying, etc.), bespoke yet a different kind of \"playing black\"—a performance whose doubly intended signification had varying effects—e.g., escape, food, avoidance of beatings. To complicate matters, when white bodies began their \"love and theft\"34 shuffle of blackness via minstrelsy, playing black became an even more ironic, if not troubling, phenomenon. Undoubtedly, each of these terms—performance and blackness—signifies differently within the specifics of its historicity. Wedded together in dialogic and [End Page 605] dialectic tension, however, these terms are at the interstices of black life, politics, and cultural production. \"Blackness\" and \"performance\" complement one another in a dialectic that becomes an ontology of racialized cultural production. \"Blackness,\" for instance, is a simulacrum until it is practiced—i.e., performed. The epistemological moment of race manifests itself in and through performance in that performance facilitates self- and cultural reflexivity—a knowing made manifest by a \"doing.\" Far from undergirding an essentialist purview of blackness, performance, as a mode of representation, emphasizes the ways in which cultures struggle to define who they are and who they want to be. Blackness, however, is not only a pawn and consequence of performance; it is also an effacement of it. Indeed, according to Rinaldo Walcott, \"to read blackness as merely 'playful' is to fall into a willful denial of what it means to live 'black.'\"35 And as I have stated elsewhere, \"blackness does not only reside in the theatrical fantasy of the white imaginary that is then projected onto black bodies. Nor is blackness always consciously acted out. It is also the inexpressible yet undeniable racial experience of black people—the ways in which the 'living of blackness' becomes a material way of knowing.\"36 The implication of this construction of blackness in relation to performance is that performance may not fully account for the ontology of race. The interanimation of blackness and performance and the tension between blackness as \"play\" and material reality further complicates the notion of what constitutes a \"black play,\" and of what \"playing black\" is and what \"playing black\" ain't. A performance of an adapted short story for the stage at Northwestern exemplifies this complexity. In 2004 a class called \"Performance of Black Literature\" staged a production of Bruce Jay Friedman's short story titled \"Black Angels.\" The story chronicles the life of Stefano, a New York Jewish suburbanite suffering a mid-life crisis because his wife has left him and taken their ten-year-old son with her. To make himself feel better, he decides to fix up his house and hires four black workers (the \"black angels\") who, much to his delight, charge him ridiculously low prices to do the work on his home (e.g., $58 to paint his two-story colonial). After the black men have transformed Stefano's home into a showplace, he is still unhappy. It turns out that what Stefano really needs is someone to talk to about his problems. In the end, it turns out to be Cotten, the head worker, who is most sympathetic to Stefano's plight. Realizing how \"therapeutic\" it is to talk to Cotten, Stefano asks Cotten how much he would charge to \"listen\" to him talk about his troubles once a week. Cotten's reply of \"fo' hunerd\" an hour sends Stefano into paroxysms, yet he accepts the offer and Cotten sits...",

      "title": "What minds have in common is space: Spatial mechanisms serving joint visual attention in infancy",
      "abstract": "A series of experiments is reported which show that three successive mechanisms are involved in the first 18 months of life in ‘looking where someone else is looking’. The earliest ‘ecological’ mechanism enables the infant to detect the direction of the adult's visual gaze within the baby's visual field but the mother's signal alone does not allow the precise localization of the target. Joint attention to the same physical object also depends on the intrinsic, attention‐capturing properties of the object in the environment. By about 12 months, we have evidence for presence of a new ‘geometric’ mechanism. The infant extrapolates from the orientation of the mother's head and eyes, the intersection of the mother's line of sight within a relatively precise zone of the infant's own visual space. A third ‘representational’ mechanism emerges between 12 and 18 months, with an extension of joint reference to places outside the infant's visual field. None of these mechanisms require the infant to have a theory that others have minds; rather the perceptual systems of different observers ‘meet’ in encountering the same objects and events in the world. Such a ‘realist’ basis for interpersonal knowledge may offer an alternative starting point for development of intrapersonal knowledge, rather than the view that mental events can only be known by construction of a theory.",

Normative propositions divide into evaluatives (such as propositions to the effect that such and such is good) and directives (such as propositions to the effect that so and so ought to do this or that). Normativity offers an account of what makes propositions at the hearts of those kinds true. 2.1. I argue that there is no property ‘being good’: the adjective ‘good’ either prefixes a kind-term K (as does ‘big’), or appears in such modified-goodness expressions as ‘good at playing tennis’, ‘good for use in making cheese, being strategically good’ and ‘being morally good’. I then argue that there is a property ‘being a good K’ if and only if K is a goodness-fixing kind, that is, if and only if K is a kind such that what being a member of K is fixes what the standards are that a K has to meet if it is to be a good K – it does this by fixing what it is for a K to be a paradigm, exemplar, good specimen of a K. Thus, the kinds umbrella, pancreas, seeing eye dog and beefsteak tomato are goodness-fixing kinds; the kinds pebble, smudge, cloud and shade of grey are not.",

The masking is conscious when one represses some crude exclamation or modestly covers some part of the body. Man conceives of himself and passes judgment on himself in three different ways: in each of his acts, taken separately; in his being as a whole, as a person; and in the complete development of his life, his entire existence including its termination. The justification of the whole life is of concern primarily to one who feels it has come to an end, either because he considers the active period of his life to have ceased or because he is confronted with death.

      "title": "“(The) Play’s the Thing”: Shakespearean drama as an end in itself",
      "abstract": "Drama, more obviously than other genres of art, is a form of play; and play, according to Johan Huizinga, is essentially autotelic, or not a means to an end. Shakespeare’s plays are trivialised if they are seen essentially as means to other ends. Science conceives of the material world as an endless chain of causes, just as utilitarianism demands that all human artefacts and endeavours take their place on an eternal chain of purposes. This model devalues all its elements, for they acquire their worth only in terms of what appears next along the chain, never in or of themselves. The model is also counter-intuitive, since human experience values things, people and events differently from one another. Some items give us more pause than others; a few invite us to lose ourselves, as a child becomes lost in a game. Drama asks an audience to play along with its playing actors, pointlessly. If there is a point – moral or utilitarian – it is a mere side effect. A play, like Cleopatra’s hopping, is a digression from the straight journey of human lives toward death; and, as Freud suggests in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, detours are the only places in which the life drive makes any inroads into the death instincts’ relentless onward progress. Shakespeare’s dramatic works not only demonstrate play, and hook their audiences into the delightful, terrifying and all-absorbing world of (the) play, but they also provide a metanarrative about play, playing with the idea of playing. This essay resists the tendency to interpret Shakespeare’s dramatic works pragmatically, and instead shows, with examples from comedies and romances, especially The Tempest and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and from tragedies including King Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet and Antony and Cleopatra, how they refuse to be means toward other ends, but “play till doomsday”, throwing reflective aspects up to their audiences and defying the puritans to stop them as they do so.",

      "abstract": "It is possible to imagine a universal cause for addictive behavior across many conditions and compulsions including addiction to alcohol, addiction to drugs, compulsive gambling, porn addiction, sex addiction, eating/food addiction, thrill-seeking, shopping addiction, trichotillomania, and other compulsive behaviors. This paper presents evidence that the universal source of addiction is the displacement mechanism, and that treatments that quiet this displacement should work with every addiction and compulsive behavior. Displacement behavior represents a bio-behavioral mechanism that essentially allows an animal to displace stress. Theoretically, the mechanism rechannels overflow mental energy built up by the brain’s attempt either to deal with or to avoid the stressful situation. The energy rechanneling occurs to another behavior or drive (e.g., grooming drive), typically whatever drive or behavior is the most readily available. Normally, the displacement mechanism is adaptive. However, in certain instances it may become harmful, particularly if the displacement occurs repetitively. For example, dogs and cats lick their fur for cleaning but also as displacement of stress. Repetitive licking may denude the hair and damage the underlying skin. Moreover, the brain may not select a healthy displacement behavior, e.g., a person getting intoxicated when stressed. An intervention based on the displacement mechanism and adaptable for any addiction has been developed, consisting of (1) helping the individual identify the problem (s) or stressor (s) that form the basis of the overflow mental energy, and (2) creating strategies to either avoid or effectively resolve these problems/stressors. For in-the-moment urges, the individual may purposely rechannel overflow brain energy to a non-harmful drive, e.g., deep breathing, to mitigate the urge, while the displacement source (s) is identified and dealt with.

God was unknown in the world which He had made; men worshipped sticks and stones; they did nothing to enhance His glory; so God looked down upon the human scene and found some men with whom He made a bargain.

However, perhaps the most widely researched phenomenon that goes by this label involves an other-oriented emotional state that is congruent with the perceived welfare of another person. The feelings associated with empathy include sympathy, tenderness, and warmth toward the other person. Other variations of empathic emotions have been investigated too, including empathic joy, empathic embarrassment, and empathic anger. The term altruism has also been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including any type of helping behavior, personality traits associated with helpful persons, and biological influences that spur protection of genetically related others. However, a particularly fruitful research tradition has focused on altruism as a motivational state with the ultimate goal of protecting or promoting the welfare of a valued other. For example, the empathy–altruism hypothesis claims that empathy (construed as an other-oriented emotional state) evokes altruism (construed as a motivational state). Empathy and altruism, regardless of how they are construed, have important consequences for understanding human behavior in general, and for understanding social relationships and well-being in particular.",

      "title": "Humans in Intelligent Environment: Near Future",
      "abstract": "For hundreds of thousands of years since the appearance of humans on the face of Earth, humans have been interacting with their environment. The interactions have always been either with living species such as other humans or organisms from other species such as dogs and cats and horses and cows and bulls and so on, as well as trees. Humans have also been interacting with non-living objects such as rocks and soil and water, etc. When humans interact with living species (except probably trees), they always expect some form of active response in return. If we run after a dog, it might run away or may come back charging at us. If we talk with another human, they may talk back or laugh or get scared, etc. Humans are accustomed to such responses. The interaction with trees can be a bit tricky. With no locomotive organs, most of the interaction may seem like one with non-living things, but we can observe that trees grow from seeds, they shed leaves in fall and grow back in spring, they bear flowers and fruits, etc. In general, though, responses to non-living things are always passive in nature. If you hit a rock, you will get hurt, but the rock is not going to actively respond in any way. Also, when left alone, the rock is not going to show any changes to its appearance. Same applies to all the other non-living things. This is what has been programmed into human brains since eternity. It started to change a little with the introduction of machines into their lives around 7000 years ago as we saw in earlier chapters. These machines were capable of moving things and reacting to human actions in a way that was different than a typical non-living thing, but it was still quite deterministic and predictable. There was no element of surprise or uncertainty in their behavior and humans quickly adapted to work with such machines. For thousands of years from then till the late twentieth century, these interactions were still about the same in spite of vast improvements in the type of machines and their capabilities. The machines were still quite deterministic and predictable. They were still not unpredictable, and no original or intelligent response would be expected from them. The definition of intelligence is deeply rooted in the behavior of living species that come with uncertainty and unpredictability along with logical thinking. As the machine technology reached a point where they started outsmarting humans in complex heuristic calculations (still quite deterministic and predictable) in the form of expert systems, an inevitable comparison with human intelligence started to surface. However, with reference to the notion of human-like intelligence, the machines were still rather dumb.",

      "abstract": "Five qualities have given man his ability to realize his full human potential: 1) an innate predisposition to gregarious life, 2) an aggressive instinct, 3) an aptitude for insight, 4) a capacity for gaining extensive knowledge and skills which are at his disposal independent of instinctual drives, and 5) an urge to acquire speech, enabling him to establish a second signal system as the basis of the unique human form of consciousness. The combination of the qualities 3, 4, and 5 are, as it were, man's accessories in his struggle for existence, and can be used to serve his aggressive needs. - Every cultural development leads in the course of generations to an increase of intellectual awareness, because an increasing share of indispensable knowledge must be passed on verbally. At the same time the importance of direct, practical first-hand experience and imitative learning declines. Especially for those men whose occupations primarily involve theoretical activities a discordance arises between the world of their imaginations and consciously-controlled ways of thought and behaviour on the one hand, and their endothymic impulses, moods and feelings (which mostly originate from the innate predisposition for gregarious life) on the other. If rationalistic processes predominate in shaping forms of social interaction, man will have to manipulate the behaviour of his fellow-men as well as his own mental capacities for emotional distancing, disregarding or even violating the incalculable \"endothymic\" part of his being.

      "abstract": "Anti-natalism is the view that persons ought morally to refrain from procreation. We offer a new argument for a principled version of anti-natalism according to which it is always impermissible to procreate in the actual world since doing so will violate the right to physical security of future, created persons once those persons exist and have the right. First, we argue that procreators can be responsible for non-trivial harms that befall future persons even if they do not cause them and if the harms are temporally delayed, provided the harms are reasonably foreseeable by procreators. For example, consider a case in which we can create a person in a room that is dangerously aflame. It would be wrong to do so since, once the person exists, they have a right that we avoid being morally responsible for unjust harms to them, and the fire in which we created them is one such unjust harm. Second, we argue that procreators are responsible for unjust harms that befall their children, since many non-trivial physical harms (e.g. broken bones, lower respiratory illnesses) are reasonably foreseeable by procreators. Thus, parents wrong their children by creating them. Third, we argue that procreators are also responsible for the unjust harms their children commit against others, since it is reasonably foreseeable that every person will inflict unjust, non-trivial physical harms on someone else. But this is worse since parents thereby share in their child's future culpable intent. Finally, we consider a number of objections to anti-natalism and argue that none of them succeed against anti-natalism generally or against our argument grounded in the right to physical security.",

For example, it is easier for us to kill than to save life. As the progress of scientific technology has increased our powers of action, our capacity to harm has reached the point at which it is possible for us to undermine worthwhile life on Earth forever. This could be done by the use of weapons of mass destruction or by causing catastrophic climatic or other environmental changes. One central, neglected problem is that a significant cause of these problems is human behaviour, caused by limitations in our psychology as moral agents. Our moral psychology has been adapted to life in small, close-knit societies with primitive technology, in which human beings have lived for virtually all of their history. This is reflected in the fact that we are psychologically myopic, that is, disposed to care more about what happens in the near future to ourselves and some individuals who are near and dear to us. We are also incapable of responding adequately to the suffering of larger collectives. Due to the fact that it is easier to harm, we tend to have a moral reluctance to harm that is stronger than our disposition to benefit, but like the latter, it is largely confined to an …",

It took more than wealth to be a vir bonus; he also had to embody a number of other characteristics, including integrity and gravitas, and adhere to a particular dignified lifestyle. These demands meant that some men of substance did not count as proper boni in its full sense of ‘good’ and might find their status challenged. A passage in Cicero’s Pro Flacco sums up who qualified as a vir bonus and who did not. He contrasts ‘viros bonos gravisque homines’ with a ‘homini egenti, sordido, sine honore, sine existumatione, sine censu’, Flac. 52. His second, negative definition of bonus is revealing and shows that a combination of qualities was required. Wealth was the obvious precondition (census), but he also had to be satisfied with his resources (i.e. not being egens). In addition, he had to be a man of honour (honos) and enjoy general esteem and a good reputation (existumatio).",

The law regulates in detail the aspects of rersubut because only matters of worship are regulated expressly in the law, the law also regulates matters relating to social life or muamalah which are given a legal basis with several important meanings and rah funds. for humans. The problem is that muamalah is assigned to humans. There are a number of legal principles to achieve certain aspects of human life. Islamic law was revealed to all mankind at one time and every moment until the miniature life ends on the Day of Judgment. Islamic law has a unique, universal and eternal nature. This is outside the proper worship of Allah SWT. We also have to be kind to other people, both in actions and words (speech), because words are a part of the human body that is quite small compared to other parts of the body but can cause sky-high losses. or it could even cause the owner to be thrown into hellfire. One should speak kind words that seem beneficial. If we suspect there is a problem, we should not make a sound because silence can be the first step to help us stay away from things that harm us. Because people who are good at keeping their mouths will occupy a high position in religion. Apart from that, other people are also protected from the dangers posed by our tombstones.",

The function of maslahah in the consumtion behavior isformulated as this equation: M = f ( X, Y, Bx, By). Based on this model, it could be expalained thatmaslalah is the outcome of an activity which can bring about berkah (benediction). In consequence, eachmoslem house hold will pay a big attantion to maslahah to do his economic goals. A moslem house holdwill select a good or service to consume if it will bring about berkah or not. It means that a moslemhouse hold doesn’t see the utility of the good or service which he will consume only, but also berkahwhich the good or service has. The behavior of finding berkah for a moslem house hold could be seenthrough his characters such as not wastefull, paying attantion to another person’s interest, not deceivingsomeone else, and rightfull.",

      "abstract": "Design has a central role in the creation of longer user product relationships. Thus far, however, sustainable design methodologies have attended almost exclusively to the somewhat superficial, bodily survival of manufactured objects, to after-effects rather than causes. Durability is as much about emotion, love and attachment as it is about fractured polymers, worn gaskets or blown circuitry. There is little point designing physical durability into goods if consumers lack the desire to keep them. The scope and power of emotional experiences delivered via objects produced through the current system are incredibly limited. Their ability to support and mediate evolving narrative experiences are weak. Commercially viable strategies are needed for emotionally durable objects which engage users on deeper and more profound levels, delivering intense and sophisticated experiences that penetrate the user psyche over longer, more rewarding, periods of time. New, alternative genres of objects could increase the durability of relationships between users and products, people and things. This will demand novel and provocative models of sustainable design capable of developing emotionally durable objects and empowering consumers to transcend the superficial urgencies of conventional consumerism and forge deep emotive connections with their possessions.",

      "title": "PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND PERSONALITY IN CHILDREN1",
      "abstract": "One aspect of the study of individual differences in children which we feel is tremendously important is an appraisal of differences in physiological behavior in response to stress. I use the term stress to include any environmental impact or stimulus, either exogenous or endogenous. The running of the roo-yard dash is, therefore, an example of a physical stress. The initial efforts of a parent to condition a 6-or 7-months-old infant's bowel action is also a stress situation for the infant, in this instance what might be called an emotional stress. The effort of the parent to make the growing child conform in his increasing social and physical contacts to a pattern which is acceptable and not too disturbing to the parents is in reality the application of a whole battery of successively applied stresses to which the child reacts, not only in terms of overt behavior but also with greater or lesser degrees of change in various aspects of body function. The infant who is too abruptly weaned reacts to his frustration not only with anxiety, irritability, and hostility; but also very probably with changes in the peristaltic rate of his intestine; in the vascularity of his kidneys and therefore their rate of excretion; in changes in heart rate, blood pressure, perspiration, and in many other ways. The birth of a little brother or sister into the family may create a very important stress situation for a child, as may entrance to school, or having a fight with the little boy down the street. The whole social and emotional adjustment of the child is accomplished through a series of environmental stresses or impacts, and in response to each of these stresses there may be a greater or lesser degree of modification of many of the biochemical and physiological processes of the body; changes which may be momentary or very prolonged in their nature. They are an integral and highly important part of the behavior of the child as a whole organism in his life situation. They cannot be dissociated from other aspects of his behavior. A knowledge of individual differences in this somatic component of stress response is not only essential for an adequate understanding of social behavior, but it is also essential to the medical man who is responsible for maintaining the health and physical effectiveness of the individual. Perhaps the posing of some of the questions which evolve from a consideration of this field will help you in grasping the scope and significance of an understanding of the physiological components of emotion in response to stress.

Assumed similarity affects judgments of well-acquainted others and strangers alike, and it is apparent for a great variety of traits, attitudes, and behaviors. Most robust assumed similarity effects are, however, apparent for characteristics that are closely linked to values. This suggests that assumed similarity can, at least in part, be attributed to perceivers' tendency to particularly see others as sharing those aspects of the self that perceivers deem highly relevant to who they are and how they see themselves.",

The irrational soul could produce certain activities such as eating, walking or performing any physical movement without greater significance than the physical act itself. Politics has for its field of study the totality of the relationships of the totality of men. Therefore the greatest good, the attainment of which would entail the greatest virtue, is the political good. Tragedy imitates those actions of man which have the good as their goal; but it does not imitate actions which have minor ends, of secondary importance. Man, as part of nature, also has certain ends in view: health, gregarious life in the State, happiness, virtue, and justice. The spectator must purify himself of the 'excess', whatever direction it takes, whether excess of love of the State to the detriment of the Family.",

However enamored we may be with an action, at some point, in response to fashion or utility, we move on.

In fact, human being always did the action that contradicted with his humanity. That is, doing “violence”. For this reason, we arrange this paper to find the illustration; how do the human being do his actions and deeds? and what do become the factors of the happening violence? This article uses many relevant theories, especially, morality and violence theories. Based on the discussion analysis above, it argues that the human deed is the humanity characteristic. It means that human does the action and he/she is responsible to those actions. But if she/he does not want to do the actions, she/he will not be responsible to those actions. The actions that is done arise from a certain motive, including to the happening of violence which is carried by the certain motive. It means that the different motive is based on different kind of violence. Finally, unfunctional mind like as usual, and the blunt of inner feeling cause the arisings of violence.",

As nothing can come from nothing, the ultimate source of order must be God, as manifested in nature and in people's abilities and limitations. It includes God's inscrutable Will, assumed to be behind pleasant as well as destructive episodes. The inherent contradictions in this issue are put aside with people's insistence on their own, God-willed need to succeed. Three human conditions furnish examples for the aesthetics of this order: Beauty in nature is amoral, but for people, who are endowed with discernment, it is linked to ethics and morals and often is ambivalent and difficult to handle. Work is a necessary part of God's order, but its aesthetic value is routinely compromised: it is a burden, often painful, and only the rich and the dead can escape it. Time is the inescapable movement that structures everything and cannot easily be manipulated. Its effect on people varies, though, as blocks of time with different life conditions throughout history suggest.",

In the “objectivist” sense, suffering is roughly synonymous with calamity or misfortune. In this sense, the precise meaning of suffering remains partly to be filled in, because what counts as calamity or misfortune is somewhat vague and partly subject to dispute. But often enough, calamity is unmistakable. One is murdered; one’s relatives are massacred; one’s house of a lifetime is swept away by a flood; one loses one’s job and is turned onto the street; one is malnourished; one contracts a debilitating disease. Sometimes suffering simply designates the experience of such objective calamities, withoutreferring to the psychological state of the people concerned.",

On a macro view all sciences, without exceptions, seem to be studying the same ‘things’ in contents or ‘objects’ namely Matter (a generic name for all forms of energy in all states), cause and effect relationships (causations or causalities) and their behavior over time. Thus the object of study of all sciences is Matter, Causalities and Time. In other words all knowledge, irrespective of the name by which we call or identify them, is all about Matter, Causalities, and Time only. Numerous theories have been developed and tested to describe the properties of and behavior of different ‘materials’ as evidenced by different fields of study. The mankind uses (applies) these causalities to achieve their own goals or wishes, be it creative or destructive, and this application of causalities (sciences) is popularly known as the field of study of engineering. All the theories and their developments in sciences and engineering revolve around this trio. There have been attempts to develop a theory of causality by many. This paper attempts to bring to light and proposes a General Theory of Causality from one of the Indian works namely ‘Naladiyaar.’",

Scrooge’s revelation is not that the dead can walk, but that they cannot atone for their previous sins. The reprehensible actions of marley’s life are embodied as heavy, restrictive objects after his death—a chain made of “ash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel” (15)—and he is left with Scrooge’s agency as a substitute for his own, explaining that it is only by persuading the living to change their ways that his eternal soul can be freed. In presenting ghosts as essentially restricted figures—catalysts to another’s action rather than the agents of their own—Dickens places marley’s ghost in a long tradition of the limited dead. marley’s chains represent not merely the consequences of his actions but the negation of action itself, a fate shared with the procession of other specters Scrooge views from his window: “The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever” (22).

This phenomenon, seemingly the expression of unconscious defense mechanisms, may be explained in various ways: as a consequence of losses related to aging; as regression in the service of the self; as an expression of the \"death instinct.\" Another level of reflection is concerned with the influence of the perception of time. Confronted by the curtailing of one's expectation of life, the aged person may unconsciously yearn for some kind of permanence, designed to conjure away the effect of passing time. We find such a process underlying rigidity, collecting, or hypochondria, which may be regarded as \"mechanisms of permanence.\" These strategies, although constituting for the aged person a defense intended, in fantasy, to preserve life, in reality constitute a trap that excludes life.",

      "abstract": "This paper discusses the mathematics that is involved in the construction of “Hex Signs” and describes the construction of such signs. Hex Signs are circular discs with intricate geometric designs with specific meanings that were hung on barns in the “Pennsylvania Dutch” region of the United States. Common designs include: Rosettes, Birds, and Star Polygons. 1. History of the “Hex Sign” Since the beginning of time man has created designs to portray his feelings. He used these designs to communicate his feelings, and at times, to protect him from what he did not understand or feared. Some common cave drawings are now believed to have been created for good luck for the upcoming harvest. In the middle ages, Europeans were using decorative symbols and motifs on everyday objects to brighten up their lives. These symbols also had a dual purpose, one of religious and ritual protection. Some symbols were used to ward off supposed evil spirits, while others were considered to be good luck or a key for a long and healthy life. Often these symbols took on specific geometric designs which were representative of their purpose. Others included everyday objects such as birds, tulips, hearts, and stars with each representing a specific and different meaning [6]. Over time these symbols became widely known and used among the Europeans. Figure 1: Single Distlefink, Double Eagle, and the Welcome Bird",

      "abstract": "Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’s idea of the “right to be let alone” was multi-dimensional. One dimension involved the breadth of harm. Harm could occur by physical or non-physical means. Justice Brandeis elaborated on this idea in Olmstead v. United States, stating that the Fourth Amendment prohibits not only physical trespasses, but, more generally, “unjustifiable intrusions by the Government upon the privacy of the individual.” Warren and Brandeis’s “right to be let alone” also included a depth dimension: harm can be caused by incomplete actions, such as attempts or threats. They wrote that liberty once meant nothing more than “freedom from actual restraint,” and the right to life served only to “protect the subject from battery in its various forms.” But with “recognition of man’s spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect,” the “protection against actual bodily injury was extended to prohibit mere attempts to do such injury; that is, the putting another in fear of such injury.” While the breadth dimension of the “right to be let alone” has been recognized in constitutional law (see Katz v. United States), its depth dimension — freedom from fear — remains undeveloped. Focusing on the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment’s “to be secure” text, this article briefly explains how Warren and Brandeis’s “right to be let alone” can be more fully incorporated into Fourth Amendment doctrine.",

We are therefore confronted with the theme of evil, too often, for convenience, manipulated. But always and in any case opposed to the concept of good. And if evil is a sad prerogative of man, good represents its essence, hope and desire: and to discuss evil one must inevitably speak of the sense of pleasure, understood not only as physical pleasure, but also psychological and mental. Pleasure is what nourishes the desire of man and his instinctive impulses; it is something that one ardently wants to replicate and increase.

Certain characters even preferred to experience agony or self-mutation for such values rather than merely death which was an easy way out and (2) how the act of self destruction is glorified if it is done for the sake of family, caste, duty (dharma), lineage and goal (when the aim or purpose of life is reached).

      "title": "Altruism as a Function of Age and Deprivation: An Interactional Study",
      "abstract": "August Comte, a French philosopher and sociologist, first introduced the term, 'altruism'. Probably, he came to adopt the term from the Italian word, 'altrui'. For Comte, meant an unselfish regard for the welfare of others. According to Bryan and London (1970), altruistic behaviour refers to those behaviours which are intended to benefit another but which appears to have a high cost to the actor with little possibility of material or social Altruism is generally defined as any form of voluntary act intended to favour another without expectations of rewards (Smith & Mackie, 2000). It refers to a kind of selfless help, which is based on pure desire to help others (Aranson, Wilson, Akert & Fehr, 2004). Examples of altruistic behaviour cover a wide range including expression of support and sympathy, doing special favours to others, acts of generosity, active defence of the rights of deprived, engagement in voluntary activities for the mentally and physically handicapped and martyrdom. It is a desire to help others which expresses itself in many ways through sympathy, philanthropy, etc. A person with strong altruistic want has affection and concern for others and is usually contrasted with the selfish person. According to Hamilton (1978), altruistic behaviour which helps only the recipient can be distinguished from other types of intra specific social interactions, for example, cooperative behaviour which helps both parties, selfish behaviour which helps the donor only, and spiteful behaviour in which both parties lose. Altruistic behaviour involves helping, sometimes, even taking great risks even though the act is not likely to be rewarded, recognized or even appreciated. Thus, an altruistic act is selfless. The same has been stressed by Walster and Piliavin (1972) who say that altruism is [a] very special form of helping behaviour that is voluntary, costly to the altruist and motivated by something other than the expected one of material or social reward. Altruism then is selfless rather than selfish. Yarrow Scott and Walter (1973) point out that is not a specific form of behaviour rather it includes a diversity of responses such as helping, sharing, rescuing, sympathizing and undoubtedly more.The term, deprivation, has stemmed from the verb, 'to deprive', which means to dispossess or strip off an individual from certain things. It, thus, implies a felt loss. It indicates a state of certain deficiencies experienced by the individual which relates to certain features of the environment that are absent or inadequate in certain degree which cause an impact on the functioning of the individual. Thus, when one states of deprivation, the emphasis is on the relevant aspect of the environment which are deficient or wanted in some respects (Sinha, 1982). Nurcombe (1970) stated that deprivation refers specially to a disposition or loss of privileges, opportunities, material goods and the like which occur with reference to three interrelated sets of basic needs-physical, psychological and socio - cultural.Altruism is a trait found in everybody. However, individuals differ with regard to depending upon several factors. Social psychologists hold the view that is indeed not inborn but a learned trait. Children can learn to be altruistic, friendly and self-controlled by modelling and socializing. Therefore, age is an important determinant of across the life-span. It has been observed that children become more prosocial with age (Berndt, 1985; Chou, 1998; Collins & Getz, 1976; Eisenberg, 1982; Rai & Gupta, 1996; Sharma, 1996). In a recent study, Ojha and Pramanick (2010) found that with advancement of age increases significantly. But there are also studies which do not reveal age related effects on altruistic behaviours (Green & Schneider, 1974; Lowe & Richley, 1973; Midlarsky & Hannah, 1985). Studies directly related to the effect of environmental deprivation on are few and far between. …",

      "title": "Beyond deﬁnition: violence in a global perspective",
      "abstract": "This article proposes that violence may be most usefully thought about as a psychological rather than a behavioural phenomenon. Violence, it is contended, is a pathological variant of aggression, where 'aggression' is used to describe a particular part of the range of affective endowments possessed by human beings. We might think about aggression as a 'set' of which violence is a subset. As an affective endowment, aggression requires integration during development and this is supplied initially by an infant's primary carers and later by other important objects and institutions in the environment and culture in which the growing child lives. In the absence of the required conditions for enabling psychological integration to take place, rather than integration, disintegration holds sway with the aggressive affects denied or dissociated from. In this instance the affects do not become part of the affective repertoire upon which the individual can draw in order to orientate him or herself to their environment and in particular objects in the environment. Instead the affect is experienced as exterior and other and in some circumstances as violating. In this circumstances violence is resorted to as a way of escaping from the experience of overwhelming affects, for example by evoking in another affective experiences that cannot be tolerated within the self. Clinical case material is used to illustrate this.",

      "abstract": "At the end of my life, I presume to restate my opinion on a question which has occupied my thinking for many years, but which most people timidly avoid because it is seen as delicate and hard to answer. Indeed it could not unjustly be said that in this case we have to do a sticking point in our moral and social outlook.(1) It consists in this: Should permissible taking of life be restricted, except in emergency situations, to an individual's act of suicide as it is in current law, or should it be legally extended to the killing of fellow beings, and under what conditions? Dealing with this issue directs us to many cases whose circumstances shake each of us to the core. Hence it is even more necessary not to leave the last word either to feelings or to exaggerated scruples, but instead to decide the matter on the basis of a thoughtful, juridical evaluation of the grounds which favor, and the considerations which oppose, an affirmative answer. Only on such firm foundations can we build further. Therefore, I put the greatest emphasis on strict legal argument. For this very reason, a firm starting point can be secured only in current law. To what extent, then, is killing humans allowed (2) today again apart from emergency situations, and what is to be understood by this? Recognizing a right to kill would be the opposite of allowing. We are not considering any such right here. Scientific clarification of the statutory starting point is even more critical because it is so frequently understood very vaguely or even totally misunderstood. Part I: The Current Legal Status of Suicide, and So-Called Complicity in It (1) Human beings are raised into existence by an irresistible force. Coming to terms with this fate is our life task. How we do that, within the limits of our freedom of movement, is up to each of us alone. To that extent one is the native sovereign of one's own life. Despite the fact that the book here translated has been mentioned in a variety of recent works, including Robert Lifton's Nazi Doctors (at pages 45-48), obtaining an intact copy of the original German text was strangely difficult. The only North American library that appears to own the book is Harvard's Widener Library, which, however, was unable to locate it. We are therefore most especially grateful to Professor Doctor Reinhard Lauth of Munich for his personal assistance, and to Mr. Richard Meiner of the Felix M einer Verlag for his remarkable generosity in producing for us a clean copy of the original book from the private Meiner Verlag archive. We were doubly fortunate in this, since the Meiner Verlag had only just rediscovered the volume, which they had thought to be irretrievably lost. Without Professor Lauth' s kind inquiries, and Richard Meiner's generosity, this translation would not have been possible. A photocopy of the original Meiner Verlag book is now held by Clark University's Goddard Library and is available to scholars who have need of it.--W. Wright, P.

The law, which is powerless to make the strength of individuals proportionate to the burdens laid upon them by life, expresses this idea distinctly by recognizing everyone's freedom to end his own life.(3) After an extended, deeply unchristian, interruption in the recognition of this right (an interruption demanded by the church and supported by the obscene idea that the God of love could wish that beings not die until they undergo endless physical and spiritual suffering),(4) it has now been fully reestablished (except in a few backward countries) as an inalienable possession for all time. Natural law would have grounds for calling this freedom the primary human fight. (II) But how this freedom is to be viewed in the context of our statutory provisions is by no means certain. …",

      "abstract": "Aggression in the sense of a grasping interest belongs to man so intimately that he wouldn't have reached these performances, these accomplishments and this power he has reached today on the vivid and unvivid nature. If the individual would not interest himself \"aggressively\" for the human beings surrounding himself, if he would not be \"hungry\" for human contact he would not associate himself for pairing and groups. He would not look for individuals who are of the same mind. This existential hunger, which is laid down in his nervous system seeking for stimuli, contains always an \"aggressive\" interest and leads man also towards searching scientifically his own psychosomatic conditions and the whole world. But this hunger can lead in certain men and under favouring conditions in whole groups and peoples to dimensions which endanger individuality and the human pride. This aggression then does not any longer serve communication but further incorporation and power. It is the beginning of the way leading to destruction of human values and human life. The responsibilities of our society should keep in mind that the human readiness for aggression does not drive further in the direction of violence and should rather be developed in the sense originally inherent to her: of an interest in the surrounding human beings and in nature.",

      "title": "TEORI KAUSALITAS ARISTOTELIAN",
      "abstract": "Abstract Causality is a fundamental concept in philosophy because it is important for understanding how things work in the world. The concept of four causes in Aristotle's philosophy, namely material, formal, efficient, and final causes, has an important role in the development of Islamic philosophy. This article will only focus on Aristotle's view as a starting point in the Physics and Metaphysics, especially those that explicitly discuss the problems of the four causes. The results are as follows: material cause (causa materialis) is the matter or physical substance from which an object or things are made. It is an important component of the nature of things, but is not sufficient on its own to explain the full nature of an object or phenomenon. Formal cause (causa formalis) is the special patterns, designs, or arrangements that give something an identity and determine its characteristic properties and behavior. It is a cause that helps us understand the intent or purpose of an object or phenomenon. Efficient cause (causa efficient) is agent or process that produce changes or movements in an object or phenomenon. It is the causes that help us understand the behavior and development of objects and phenomena. The final cause (causa finalis) is the purpose, end or purpose of an object or phenomenon, which gives it direction and meaning. It is cause that helps us understand the nature of things, and is important for understanding the purpose or inherent purpose of objects and phenomena. Keyword: Aristotelian cause; material causes; formal cause; cause efficient; final cause Abstrak Kausalitas adalah konsep fundamental dalam filsafat karena penting untuk memahami bagaimana sesuatu bekerja di dunia. Konsep empat sebab dalam filsafat Aristoteles, yaitu sebab material, formal, efisien, dan final, memiliki peran penting dalam perkembangan filsafat Islam. Tulisan hanya akan memfokuskan diri pada pandangan Aristoteles sebagai titik pijakan dalam teks Physics dan Metaphysics terutama yang secara eksplisit membahas masalah empat kausa tersebut. Hasilnya adalah sebagai berikut: penyebab material (causa materialis) adalah materi atau substansi fisik yang darinya suatu objek atau benda dibuat. Ini adalah komponen penting dari sifat benda, tetapi tidak cukup dengan sendirinya untuk menjelaskan sifat penuh dari suatu objek atau fenomena. Penyebab formal (causa formalis) adalah pola, desain, atau pengaturan khusus yang memberikan identitas pada sesuatu dan menentukan sifat dan perilaku karakteristiknya. Ini adalah penyebab yang membantu kita memahami maksud atau tujuan dari suatu objek atau fenomena. Penyebab efisien (causa efficient) adalah agen atau proses yang menghasilkan perubahan atau pergerakan pada suatu objek atau fenomena. Ini adalah penyebab yang membantu kita memahami perilaku dan perkembangan objek dan fenomena. Penyebab final (causa finalis) adalah maksud, akhir atau tujuan dari suatu objek atau fenomena, yang memberinya arah dan makna. Ini adalah penyebab yang membantu kita memahami sifat benda, dan penting untuk memahami tujuan atau tujuan inheren dari objek dan fenomena. Kata kunci: Kausa Aristotelian; sebab material; sebab formal; sebab efisien; sebab final",

      "abstract": "There is much to be said in favour of the idea that anticipation and the preemption and deception which it permits play an important role in the social life of both humans and a number of other primates. This idea has been developed anew, particularly for the human case, in a number of different disciplines for a variety of different reasons. Goody (this volume), points to a number of instances, and the list could be extened almost ad nauseam. It ranges from computer scientists proposing plan-construction algorithms and user-modelling procedures for natural language front-ends, to economists speculating on the actions of economic agents planning their moves in the market-place with respect to the actions of others. The scope and explanatory range of this idea in any of these fields has always been questionable. In economics, for example, the very different effects of ignorance, habit and culture on individual choice have often been far greater than those of individual ratiocination. Nevertheless, any area of human activity which involves actual or potential interaction with other humans (and that might mean all of human life) can be seen to have characteristics which reveal an anticipation of how others will view and respond to one's actions.",

      "abstract": "An agent who takes his own life acts in violation of the moral law, according to Kant; suicide, and, by extension, assisted suicide are therefore wrong. By a similar argument, and with a few important exceptions, killing is wrong; implicitly, then, voluntary euthanasia is also wrong. Kant's conclusions are uncompelling and his argument in these matters is undermined on considering other areas of his thought. Kant, in forbidding suicide and euthanasia, is conflating respect for persons and respect for people, and assuming that, in killing a person (either oneself or another), we are thereby undermining personhood. But an argument along these lines is faulty according to Kant's own standards. There is no reason why Kantians have to accept that self-killing and euthanasia are contrary to the moral law. Even if some Kantians adhere to this doctrine, others can reject it.",

      "title": "Sampling in Ethnographic Fieldwork",
      "abstract": "An ethnographer cannot avoid selecting some people, objects, or events for study, thereby renouncing, for a time at least, the possibility of studying others. From a vast range of possibilities, he takes up work in a particular tribe, village, or town; questions certain respondents; employs a few informants; observes some artefacts, situations, or behavioural events, and makes observations at restricted times. If the word 'sampling' is used so broadly, then fieldworkers are constantly sampling the universe of people, situations, objects and behavioural events with which they are occupied. Seldom, however, do they keep track of how they drew a sample or report its composition. Even statements as general as my pseudonymous list of principal Kaska Indian informants and subjects,1 and Margaret Mead's 'neighbourhood maps',2 identifying the adolescent and pre-adolescent girls she observed, are rare. An anthropologist characteristically extends his remarks beyond his sample and talks about 'the' Kaska Indians and Samoan girls or about child rearing, quarrels and pottery techniques in general-as though he had studied the community, category, or topic exhaustively. The usual spoken implication is that for his problem, the sample adequately represented a larger universe of actors, topics, culture patterns, techniques, or other units under study and, therefore, could provide reliable information about that universe as it existed at a particular time. A statistically conscious observer might object and point out that for a sample to be considered in a strict sense representative of the universe whence it came, it must have been selected in a suitable manner. Anthropologists are likely to respond by protesting that it is not they who decide what persons or events to use as sources of data; such decisions are practically made for them when certain individuals volunteer their help, some groups extend welcome, and some techniques happen to be accessible to observation.3 That units force themselves on a researcher's attention, is merely a figure of speech. It overlooks the fieldworker's readiness to respond positively or negatively to certain cues in the field situation and ignores his active involvement in deciding how to respond to environmental opportunities or when to surrender to unbreachable limitations.",

      "title": "Phobia",
      "abstract": "The concept of “phobia” suggests something more than “fear,” conveying instead an intensely anxious reaction to a specific stimulus that verges on the excessive. The term was first recorded in the post‐classical Latin formulation “hydrophobia,” which designated rabies through its sufferers' typical display of fear in proximity to water. This supplied the model for later formations in English, which occurred in fairly limited instances during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before appearing in abundance from the nineteenth century onward. In particular, it has been observed that “the last three decades of the nineteenth century were phobia's belle époque ” (Trotter 2004: 463). Whereas fear is an instinctual part of our brain physiology, a life‐preserving process rooted in the amygdala's function in processing negative emotions, a sufferer of phobia “experiences a marked, persistent, and excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of, or when anticipating an encounter with, the specific object or situation” (APA 1994: 444). In an almost Gothic moment of possession, phobia invades and engulfs the body, infiltrating the mind and disrupting normal mental associations – a process acutely captured in William James' description of the response of an agoraphobic, who “is seized with palpitation and terror at the sight of any open place or broad street […] He trembles, his knees bend, he may even faint at the idea” (1890: ii. 421). Over a quarter of a century later, Sigmund Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1916) pointed out the disproportion between the triviality of stimulus and the immensity of response in the phobic sufferer.",

      "abstract": "The principle of ḥazakah is found in numerous Talmudic passages. It is probably the most ubiquitous of all Talmudic themes. The term is from a root meaning ‘to be strong’, ‘to persist in’, ‘to grasp’, hence ḥazakah means’ to follow the presumptive state’, ‘that which has been seized hold of. Where there is a doubt in law or in the circumstances of a given case, the matter under consideration is not treated as a mere doubt but as if it were a certainty. It remains in that presumptive state which obtained when the doubt arose. If, for instance, there is a doubt whether a given piece of meat is kasher, it is forbidden but only as a doubtful prohibition. But if the doubt arose whether an animal had been properly slaughtered it is treated as forbidden as if it were a certainty, because here there is a presumptive state, the animal while alive being forbidden. Similarly, if a husband delivered to his wife a doubtful get she is treated as a married woman not by doubt but by certainty, since before the get had been delivered she had the presumptive status of a married woman and she remains in this state until she has definitely emerged from it. Thus ḥazakah determines the law in all cases of doubt so that the matter is no longer treated as doubtful. Naturally, ḥazakah does not tell us anything about the actuality of the law or the circumstances. It does not tell us, for instance, that where there are doubts regarding the slaughtering of the animal the animal has not really been slaughtered correctly.",

Without the existence of the first small group, Adam and Eve, Eve would not have exerted group pressure on Adam to bite the apple. Without Adam eating the apple, this first small group would not have been sent out from the Garden of Eden to populate the earth. This (mostly) frivolous example of the influence of groups on individual behavior highlights some fundamental characteristics that define groups (Marrow, 1969). First, the minimum number of people necessary for a group is two. Second, the influence of groups does not always lead to positive outcomes. Third, group members usually have a common fate (e.g. both Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden). Fourth, there are important group processes related to interaction and communication that move the group towards a common goal. Fifth, these group processes can exert an exceptional motivational influence on members (Marrow, 1969).",

Although it is commendable to try not to offend other people's sensitivities it is ajustifiable position to claim that people should accept the fact that, especially if their personal moral or cultural approach is far from liberal, their feelings will get offended by free expression. If desires are seen as something valuable to the holder and her identity, she should be free to voice them instead of nurturing them in secret. Any rational person understands that in a pluralist society, we do have desires that seem odd or even incomprehensible to others. Our aesthetic, hedonistic, social, religious, and other values are often contrary or even contradictory. A person who first and foremost desires to indulge in hedonistic pleasures is seen with dismay by his neighbor for whom physical pleasures denote abstinence and strongest possible self-discipline. Similarly an ardent churchgoer cannot really understand her neighbor for whom baseball seems to be the holiest of the holy. Pure and simple realism should show us that either only the tiniest societies can be culturally homogeneous or only an absolute tyranny reinforced by heavy sanctions will mold people into 80an obedient lot who do not cast a hungry eye to what is not to be desired. A reasonable demand in democratic and tolerant society is to accept the unavoidable existence of conflicting desires, opinions, and convictions.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Transgressions or, beyond the Obvious I Recognitions and MisrecognitionsTransgression: it is a common enough word, circulated enough for us all to believe we understand what is meant by it when it is used.Ideas about what constitutes transgression are equally commonplace.Transgression, we might say, goes without saying.Yet, is that in fact the case?Or is it not that we are so used to what we take to be the idea of transgression that we have, in all truth, forgotten, or not even become aware of the extent to which transgression constitutes our identities?Believing we understand the term as indicative of breaking a law, doing something illicit, disrupting order and rebelling against societal norms, if and when we think we transgress we do no more than conform to expectations of acceptable 'deviance'.We act up in a manner already in some sense prescribed, whether socially or historically, and so merely conform in a way that is more or less tolerated, even when excoriated.Transgression however runs much deeper than that.It is, as I shall argue in the present volume, not merely the breaking of a code, a rebellion against normative social or cultural constraints; rather it is the very pulse that constitutes our identities, and we would have no sense of our own subjectivity were it not for a constant, if discontinuous negotiation with the transgressive otherness by which we are formed and informed.Identity must needs believe in its own stability for the conventions of transgression to apply.However, 'for a subject to imagine itself as having a stable identity', remarks Elisabeth Bronfen, is always an act of misrecognition (mésconnaissance), a fiction, an illusion…'.She continues, 'though language allows for a differentiation between self and Other… this differentiation is never complete and the imaginary register never disappears … In a sense any image is the death because the negation of the thing, for it signifies that something was thought or recognised, not as real but as an image' (Elisabeth Bronfen 1992, 395) Seeing oneself as having a stable identity is, then, to misrecognize one's selfhood.It is to project an image and take that simulacrum as the reality, as Bronfen suggests.From this basis of misunderstanding or, to anticipate the next citation, from this 'mode of production' that generates the social structure we call the self, the subject or identity, it is an all too easy step to imagine the self negated, the subject beyond the law, situated, and situating itself, in a locus of negativity, opposition, and transgressive rebellion.This leads to the following question.'If', asks Julia Kristeva, ' in certain modes of production, social structure projects itself…by circumscribing a represented, assumed, encased negativity…how does this closed place function generally, logically, outside the … system?' (97).Kristeva's inscription of precise location, of an inside and an outside in the definition of proscribed or outlaw act or event is instructive.It comments on the coercive nature of modes of production that are shaped by historical, cultural and ideological forces, which are themselves not stable but which shift endlessly, in order that a 'social structure' such as the subject might be incorporated in the mode of production, (mis)recognised as a product of that mode, or otherwise placed outside, expelled or marginalised.Identifying illicit practice, determined as a negativity in relation to, and yet closed off from the social structure, Kristeva defines in part at least the transgressive subject produced as a historical subject and determined through the reading of a transgressive space or locus.Her description of spatial position, of clearly defined positions based on perceivable oppositions such as I have indicated, is far from uncommon in the thinking of transgressive events.However, as valuable a starting point as it may be, Kristeva's reading does not take into account sufficiently the endless differentiation implied in Elisabeth Bronfen's argument, and",

However throughout his published works there are numerous references to the phenomenon. In this presentation I will make use of these scattered references to articulate a Dabrowskian theory of the developmental function of loss. Briefly the theory is as follows. Those who possess psychic overexcitability (especially of the emotional and imaginational kinds) develop intense attachments to the significant persons in their lives, with the consequence that when they sustain a loss of one of these significant persons, their mourning is correspondingly intense. This intense mourning can result in one or another form of dysfunctional behaviour, the production of creative works, or personality development. In some cases, e.g., Michelangelo, all three are found in the same person.",

      "title": "Retinal vessel tree as biometric pattern",
      "abstract": "In current society, reliable authentication and authorization of individuals are becoming more and more necessary tasks for everyday activities or applications. Just for instance, common situations such as accessing to a building restricted to authorized people (members, workers,...), taking a flight or performing a money transfer require the verification of the identity of the individual trying to perform these tasks. When considering automation of the identity verification, the most challenging aspect is the need of high accuracy, in terms of avoiding incorrect authorizations or rejections. While the user should not be denied to perform a task if authorized, he/she should be also ideally inconvenienced to a minimum which further complicates the whole verification process Siguenza Pizarro & Tapiador Mateos (2005). With this scope in mind, the term biometrics refers to identifying an individual based on his/her distinguished intrinsic characteristics. Particularly, this characteristics usually consist of physiological or behavioral features. Physiological features, such as fingerprints, are physical characteristics usually measured at a particular point of time. Behavioral characteristics, such as speech or handwriting, make reference to the way some action is performed by every individual. As they characterize a particular activity, behavioral biometrics are usually measured over time and are more dependant on the individual’s state of mind or deliberated alteration. To reinforce the active versus passive idea of both paradigms, physiological biometrics are also usually referred to as static biometrics while behavioral ones are referred to as dynamic biometrics. The traditional authentication systems based on possessions or knowledge are widely spread in the society but they have many drawbacks that biometrics try to overcome. For instance, in the scope of the knowledge-based authentication, it is well known that password systems are vulnerable mainly due to the wrong use of users and administrators. It is not rare to find some administrators sharing the same password, or users giving away their own to other people. One of the most common problems is the use of easily discovered passwords (child names, birth dates, car plate,...). On the other hand, the use of sophisticated passwords consisting of numbers, upper and lower case letters and even punctuation marks makes it harder to remember them for an user. Nevertheless, the password systems are easily broken by the use of brute forcewhere powerful computers generate all the possible combinations and test it against the authentication system. In the scope of the possession-based authentication, it is obvious that the main concerns are 6",

      "title": "Lifeboat Ethics - To Sink, Or Not To Sink: That Is The Question",
      "abstract": "Hardin (1974) used a lifeboat metaphor to simplify the issues involved in living on a finite planet with finite resources. The human species hopes to remain on Earth for many generations (i.e., sustainable use without abuse of the planet), and the use of metaphors will help humankind understand and cope with vast temporal and special scales and complex multivariate data. Further, Hardin (1974) believed that rights and responsibilities must be congruent. He asserted (Hardin 1976): “lifeboat ethics is merely a special application of the logic of the commons.” He also provided some ways to avoid sinking the planetary lifeboat (Hardin 1985). Hardin’s numerous publications identified the major issues humankind must resolve in the 21 century — or suffer grievously. Hardin’s lifeboat metaphor is ideal for illustrating the consequences of individuals leaving (emigrate from) a sinking or badly overcrowded lifeboat to board (immigrate to) a lifeboat with more desirable conditions. The metaphor is weak in that the lifeboats (islands and continents) cannot rise when the sea level rises. As Revkin (2004) notes, Greenland has an ice cap that is two miles thick; Revkin calls it a “freshwater Gulf of Mexico” that is frozen atop the world’s largest island. Equally important is that the influx of freshwater from this melting ice cap might block currents in the North Atlantic that help moderate the weather of the North Atlantic (Revkin 2004). The lifeboat metaphor does not convey the high probability that rising water will reduce food production while crowding people on a small land surface. Changing weather would also impair agricultural productivity, probably pushing it into instability. As Hardin (1974) noted, lifeboats should not be filled to capacity so that each will maintain a safety factor. Sachs (2004) maintains the necessity for both understanding and resolving human catastrophe security threats arising from extreme poverty. The poor are on sinking or unsafe (i.e., not sustainable) lifeboats, which they will almost certainly be tempted to leave, even at great personal risk, if their circumstances are not improved. The Camp of the Saints (Raspail 1973) is an apocalyptic, but believable, vision of future events if the disproportionate allocation of planetary resources worsens or if damage to natural systems reduces Earth’s carrying capacity. The quest for sustainable use of the planet is an attempt to avoid a post-human world. Many circumstances are contrary to achieving this goal; two of the most important follow. (1) An ecological “overshoot” has been caused by the human economy. Stated more directly, humankind is not living within the regenerative capacity of the biosphere (Wackernagel et al. 2002)—humankind is exceeding the long-term carrying capacity of the planet. (2) Access to the global commons is not regulated (Cairns 2003-2004). Hardin (1968) has eloquently described the tragic consequences of free access to the commons by people or organizations with little or no conscience. Prestigious scientific groups (Union of Concerned Scientists 1992, Royal Society of London and the United States National Academy of Sciences 1992) and world-class scholars (e.g., Wilson 1993) have issued warnings about the dangerous deterioration of environmental conditions. Myers (1996) has included national security as an environmental issue, and his book is not an isolated example of the connection between biospheric conditions and political conditions. Since culture has markedly shaped human evolution (e.g., Wilson 1998), humankind may be its own worst enemy. Arguably, the leaked Pentagon report that warns of climate wars (Environmental News Service,",

The results can be summarized as follows : Firstly, minimalism is a trend in art attempting to seek essence of the object by presenting simple and disciplined expressions by minimal formative means and minimal production process. Secondly, minimal expression in fashion means seeking simplicity and purity by using minimum design elements and minimal productive process. Thirdly, external form of minimal expression fashion can be created through application of following minimal expression techniques. 1. Minimal expression techniques in terms of line mean smooth curve flowing along body contours, straight lines of diagonal lines into desciplined silhouette or rendering internal contour lines. 2. Minimal expression techniques in terms of forms mean forms of smooth curves flowing along body or forms with simple geometirc forms from qualitative aspects. In terms of volume it means quest for essence of pure body itself by revealing body as it is by minimizing the size of dress or its area and herein us contained using simple geometric pattern or utilizing textiles without any patterns. 3. Minimal expression techniques by colors mean simple colors such as primary colors, colors without clear distinctions or natural colors and in terms of quantity it means quest for one color within one item of dress or combination of each items when getting dressed. 4. Minimal expression techniques in terms of fabrics mean fabrics with simple surface. In terms of quantity it meams quest for emssence of tight fitting thin textiles to human body or using transparent materials to human body thus exposing body contours as it is. 5. Minimal expression techniques in terms of productive process mean minimizing process of tailoring, sewing or ornamenting and seeking for simplicity and purity. 6. Minimal expression techniques in terms of manaufacturing process mean selection of technique for conveying simple image with disciplined simple image. Fourthly, minimal expression fashion with external expression as mentioned in the above lay body-priority style and its internal meaning can be asummed as quest for essence and purity of human body.",

The same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards, as from the operation of the axe or wheel.

Rationing, or providing guidelines for the use of resources, is a profoundly human activity, arising from our capacity to reason, especially our capacity to reason with an eye to the future and plan accordingly.

Therefore the effort to ration resources can be unjust, morally neutral, or a virtue, depending on the motives of those rationing, the qualities of the item to be rationed, and the goals and purposes of providing a plan for allocating resources.

      "title": "Open issues in the cognitive science of conditionals",
      "abstract": "The conditional, if...then, is probably the most important term in natural language and forms the core of systems of logic and mental representation. It occurs in all human languages and allows people to express their knowledge of the causal or law-like structure of the world and of others' behaviour, e.g., if you turn the key the car starts, if John walks the dog he stops for a pint of beer; to make promises, e.g., if you cook tonight, I'll wash up all week; to regulate behaviour, e.g., if you are drinking beer, you must be over 18 years of age; to suggest what would have happened had things been different, e.g., if the match had been dry it would have lit, among many other possible uses. The way in which the conditional is modelled also determines the core of most logical systems. Unsurprisingly, it is also the most researched expression in the psychology of human reasoning.\r\n\r\nCognition and Conditionals is the first volume for over 20 years (On Conditionals, 1986, CUP) that brings together recent developments in the cognitive science and psychology of conditional reasoning. Over the last 10 to 15 years, research on conditionals has come to dominate the psychology of reasoning providing a rich seam of results that have created new theoretical possibilities. This book shows how these developments have led researchers to view people's conditional reasoning behaviour more as succesful probabilistic reasoning rather than as errorful logical reasoning. It shows how the multifarious, and apparently competing, theoretical positions developed over the last 50 years in this area - mental logics, mental models, heuristic approaches, dual process theory, and probabilistic approaches-have responded to these insights. Its organisation reflects the view that an integrative approach is emerging that may need to exploit aspects of all these theoretical positions to explain the rich and complex phenomenon of reasoning with conditionals. It includes an introductory chapter relating the development of the psychology of reasoning to developments in the logic and semantics of the conditional. It also includes chapters by many of the leading figures in this field.\r\n\r\nCognition and Conditionals will be a valuable resource for cognitive scientists, psychologists and philosophers interested how people actually reason with conditionals.",

This ideal is derived, in part, from the Jataka Tales, where the activities of the Buddha prior to his ultimate enlightenment are described. According to the Mahayana tradition, the Bodhisattva forgoes his own final enlightenment or realization of Nibbana until he has helped all other beings escape samsara. In this respect, the Bodhisattva is considered superior to the Arahant who pursues his own individual enlightenment.Mahasiddha: Sanskrit term meaning “Great Master” or “Fully Perfected One,” it refers to the ideal of Buddhist practice in the Vajrayana tradition, to one who has mastered the Tantras.Mahayana: Sanskrit word meaning “the greater way” or “greater vehicle,” followers of this version of Buddhism used this term to distinguish themselves from their earlier predecessors, the Hinayana or “lesser way” or “lesser vehicle,” most notably, the Theravada. It is now generally thought that this form of Buddhism developed within some Buddhist communities between 100 bce and 200 ce. Its teachings, which are located in its own Perfection of Wisdom (Prajnaparamita) literature, represent a major revision and reinterpretation of many fundamental ideas, concepts, and practices of “early” Buddhism. Among its most basic teachings are: emphasis on wisdom or insight (prajna) and compassion (karuna), espousal of the Bodhisattva ideal, and development of the idea of emptiness (sunyata) as a way of expressing the truth that things do not have fixed or inherent natures or essences.

      "title": "The Life Mission Theory II. The Structure of the Life Purpose and the Ego",
      "abstract": "Pursuing your life mission is often very difficult, and many frustrations are experienced along the way. Major failures to bring out our potential can cause us considerable emotional pain. When this pain is unbearable, we are induced to shift from one intention and talent to another that better allows us to adapt and survive. Thus, we become set on a course that brings out a secondary or tertiary talent instead of the primary talent. This talent displacement may be expressed as a loss of our true nature or true self. The new purpose in life now functions as the core of a new personality: the ego. The ego has a structure similar to that of the true self. It is anchored in a talent and it draws on subtalents. But the person who is centered in his or her ego is not as powerful or talented as the person he or she originally was, living the primary purpose of life. This is because the original personality (the true self or “higher self”) is still there, active and alive, behind the ego. Symptoms, disorders, and diseases may be explained by the loss of energy, joy in life, and intuitive competence because of inner conflicts, which may be alleviated or cured in the salutogenetic process of Antonovsky that helps patients find their sense of coherence or their primary purpose in life. Many cases of reduced ability to function, physically as well as psychologically, socially or sexually, can also be explained and alleviated in this way. When a person discovers his true talent and begins to use it with dedication, privately as well as professionally, his life will flourish and he may overcome even serious disease and great adversity in life. The salutogenetic process can also be called personal development or “quality of life as medicine”. It is important to note that the plan for personal development laid out by this theory is a plan not for the elimination of the ego, but for its cultivation. An existentially sound person still has a mental ego of course, but it is centered on the optimal verbal expression of the life mission. Such an ego is not in conflict with one�s true self, but supports the life and wholeness of the person, although in an invisible and seamless way. The more developed the person, the more talents are taken into use. So although the core of existence remains the same throughout life, the healthy person continues to grow. As the number of talents we can call on is unlimited, the journey ends only at death. Understanding the concept of the ego, it is very easy for the physician to motivate the patient to go through a lot of difficulties in order to grow and develop, and when the patient fully understands the concept of the ego and the true self (higher self), the patient gets a strong feeling of direction in personal development, and a motivation to fight the internal obstacles for quality of life, health, and the ability to function.",

Variety saves life from dullness and monotony. But the noble and innocent attempt, to enrich life with diversification or versatility, renders life infested with uncertain matters. Thus perhaps dogs a man from cradle to grave. In fact perhaps is so powerful that it controls human Fate, with lifelong guarantee, whether man wants it or not it seldom bothers. The use of perhaps is due mainly to for two reasons namely ignorance or lack of knowledge. But perhaps this doctrine seems to be the manifestation of half truth. Even a person having full knowledge may use perhaps due to ambiguity or plurality or plausibility of many situations. In many cases the reasons are quite unknown and mysterious as well. For example, a promising politician may not win the election. The model of a famous economist may fail. The satellite may break and go to sea instead of flying into the sky. Lover may not keep words. In all these uncertain mundane affairs perhaps rules smartly with certainty.",

This sense of basic purpose, of what fundamentally animates us, is not some function of the human condition, or of its capacity for reflection and action, though it may sometimes seem that way, but on the contrary, extends to everything that can be said to have an existence, whether that be other animals, other living organisms, or even those features of the world, such as rocks and waterfalls, that flourish or fail to flourish, have worth or fail to have worth, despite the fact that they themselves play no active role, whether deliberative or otherwise, in securing either their flourishing or their worth.1 That said, as human beings we have a distinctive, some might call it a special, relationship to this shared purpose, one that is born of our distinctive capacity to perceive and to discharge the many and complex responsibilities of living well.

There is a certain stereotype about calling something \"SATANIC\". Labeling things, activities, clothing, art, products, people etc. as \"devil worshipping\" often isnt connected to any kind of worship what so ever. There is this re-accuring act of calling out something as \"Satanic\" often snowballing the situation into an idea of an active threat, thats dangerous to the public. The \"SATANIC PANIC\" era lead to over a 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of these so called \"Satanic practices\" and many people ended up in jail because of it. This Satanic labeling has become a parcipatory missinformation quest.",

But however artificially that fabric may have been constructed, and however admirable the skill and the foresight that have been displayed in ensuring the safety of its elaborate mechanism, and in preserving the harmony of its complicated movements, it yet of necessity contains within itself the elements of its own dissolution. The animal machine, in common with every other mechanical contrivance, is subject to wear and deteriorate by constant use. Not only in the greater movements of the limbs, but also in the more delicate actions of the internal organs, we may trace the operation of many causes inevitably leading to their ultimate destruction. Continued friction must necessarily occasion a loss of substance in the harder parts of the frame, and evaporation is constantly tending to exhaust the fluids. The repeated actions of the muscles induce certain changes in these organs, both in their mechanical properties and chemical composition, which impair their powers of contraction, and which, if suffered to continue, would, in no long time, render them incapable of exercising their proper functions; and the same observation applies also to the nerves, and to all the other systems of organs.",

If one's entire lifetime investment is based on equipment such as wealth, power, children, spouse, science, health, reputation, religion, peace, happiness, serving people, serving God, freedom, marriage, love, mysticism and the like, the result will be nothing but loss and harm, because equipment may disappear in a moment and is impermanent.

      "title": "Catholic Thought and Intellectual Property: Learning from the Ethics of Obligation",
      "abstract": "The twelfth century canon lawyer Gratian once wrote Feed the man dying of hunger, because if you have not fed him you have killed him. If Gratian were alive today, he might take a look at the current state of global health and say, Succor the woman dying of disease, because if you have not helped her you have killed her. Both of these statements express an ethical obligation: if I have food, and someone else who is hungry does not, I am obligated to share my food. Likewise, if I have medicine, and someone else who is sick does not, I am obligated to share my medicine. Unfortunately, with regard to medicines and other essential products, modern institutions of intellectual property often fail to enforce or even recognize such ethical obligations. In some ways these institutions uphold an even harsher attitude regarding intellectual property than tangible personal property. With food, even if the hungry person receives no bread, he is still permitted to produce his own. With medicines, medical technologies, and other types of goods that are protected by institutions of intellectual property, the law can and often does prevent the sick person from producing her own. This paper contends that current institutions of intellectual property, especially patent law and policy, fail to adequately articulate the ethical obligations of intellectual property rights holders. By drawing on the numerous resources regarding the ethical obligations of property holders present in the Catholic tradition, the paper seeks to determine the obligations of intellectual property rights holders towards others, particularly in the context of ensuring widespread access to essential medicines. By focusing on the language of obligation, a language which is often neglected in rights-oriented debates, I believe we can more clearly understand the role of intellectual property in our society. The only way to ensure ethically defensible institutions of intellectual property is for policymakers, government officials, and those in the legal profession to consider seriously the ethical obligations of intellectual property rights holders, and to allow those obligations to inform their decision making. Additionally, scholars of religious ethics should begin to critically examine the institutions of intellectual property, institutions that have heretofore received only limited scrutiny from religious communities.",

We can repent and apologize, but we have not the time or the will to ‘make it up’ to God. He must himself provide the reparation in the form of a perfect life of the kind that we should have lived. The second reason is to identify with our suffering, and the third is to reveal to us moral and theological truths that we need for living.",

      "title": "Norms of Trust",
      "abstract": "Norms are instructions how to act. Their form is the imperative or hypothetical imperative: ‘Do X’, ‘Don’t do X’, or ‘if Y, then do X’. There are moral norms, epistemic norms, norms of practical rationality, and social norms. In following norms we come to believe truths, to be justified in our belief, act rationally, lead a virtuous life, and act in morally permissible ways. In following social norms we come to lead a life that is acceptable to a given society, a life that conforms to this socially established way of living. Social norms thereby differ from other norms in that their prescriptions are relative rather than universal. At the most trivial level these norms can be no more than a matter of etiquette: they are a matter of adopting the right register, wearing the right clothes, or, for instance, using the outermost knife and fork first. In these matters most would accept that when in Rome one should do as the Romans do. But this easy-going relativism towards the prescriptions of social norms is not always so easy: social norms can be strongly felt. And nor are all social norms trivial: adopting the right register, for instance, can shade into treating someone the right way and thereby engage moral norms. Similarly, prescriptions of politeness can overlap with epistemic prescriptions. ‘Believe people’ might be a matter of politeness, but it could also be an epistemic norm if truth-telling were the norm. Is ‘tell the truth’ a social norm, and so the norm? Should we believe people? This chapter aims to argue that, roughly speaking, we have these social norms. It aims to offer an explanation of these social norms and an account of how this bears on epistemological theories of testimony as a source of knowledge.",

After the mind has suffered from an acute paroxysm of grief, and the cause still continues, we fall into a state of low spirits; or we may be utterly cast down and dejected. Prolonged bodily pain, if not amounting to an agony, generally leads to the same state of mind. If we expect to suffer, we are anxious; if we have no hope of relief, we despair. The words for closely related feelings can be confusing. In the next paragraph Darwin uses the term grief (which the dictionary says is sorrow or anguish in response to a loss) as a general term for two more specific emotions: distress and sadness. W each have suggested that the term distress be used for what Darwin describes as the violent and almost frantic movements of grief. We reserve the term sadness for the state which often follows distress, when, as Darwin observes, the person no longer wishes for action but becomes passively resigned to the feelings of grief.",

Ignorance of human nature itself as a whole due to the limitations of human knowledge about him, especially in revealing spiritual things that are abstract. This limitation due to three factors: First, in the history of human life, he was more interested in investigating natural materials (concrete), than things that are immaterial (abstract). Secondly, the limitations of human reason are only able to think about things that are instrumental rather than things that are substantial and complex.

The Third Any identity (an individual, a community, a nation) exists  with  an inherent debt towards the Other, since as an identity — it constructs itself to a large extent through the difference from and of the Other. This ontological predicament inevitably involves an ethical question — the question of reciprocity: one's obligation is to repay the  debt. That ethical question is frequently annulled through an essentialist construal of the concept of identity. if we  reject or want to avoid essentialism, however, we have to recognize the obligation and find ways of fulfilling it:  through obliterating clear-cut boundaries and construing identities  as  nebular densities rather than as reified ob­ jectivities and, consequently, through internalizing the difference and through accommodating the Other into the  space of one's own identity. Yet, since reciprocity is of itself a symmetrical concept and must work both ways, the  question of obligation must also be reversed: what are the obligations of the Other? Can the obligation to recipro­ cate be waived from the Other in certain circumstances? Or will it rather be an incapacitation of the Other through  deprivation of responsibility? The problem becomes particularly acute in the circumstances of displacement:  exile, emigration, or even hospitality. All these circumstances involve a misbalance of power, an interpenetration and a conflict of values, legitimisation of individual and communal expectations. In such a context, while keeping  in mind the ethical aspect of obligation, one must also be aware of its political and axiological implications,  especially when the problem of reciprocity is approached in terms of racial, ethnic and cultural difference. The  objective of the essay is to explore those multifaceted aspects of  the obligation of  reciprocity and to place them in  the context of post-Cartesian notions of subjectivity on the one hand, and of multiculturalism, on the other hand.",

      "abstract": "Although humans prize freedom above all else, we routinely deny freedom to nonhuman animals with whom we share our planet. We imprison and enslave animals, we exploit them for their labor and their skin and bodies, we constrain what they can do and with whom they can interact. Captivity—including physical confinement, social isolation, and chronic exposure to stress—leads to measurable physiological and psychological trauma. Captive animals also suffer the harm of being denied the opportunity to live their own lives, on their own terms. In captivity, animals cannot achieve higher order needs such as exercising control over their lives, making choices, forming meaningful relationships with others, and engaging in forms of play and creativity. Although there might be some reasonable conversation or debate about the appropriateness of incarceration for humans, there is no reasonable justification for incarcerating animals.",

      "abstract": "Religion plays a central role in the plot of virtually every ancient fictional narrative, influencing the lives, actions, mentality, practices, beliefs and eventual fates of the characters (and narrators); the types, interventions and motives of divinity or other uncanny forces; the use of mythological exemplars, and more broadly, the array of problems that the entire subject poses for interpretation of the genre's conventions. The novels are full of: temples, shrines, altars, priests, rituals and offerings, dreams (or oracles), prophecies, divine epiphanies, aretalogies, mystic language and other metaphors of the sacred (not forgetting, in addition, exotic barbarian rites). Indeed, religious elements, such as these, familiar to virtually any inhabitant of the ancient world, are richly attested, of course, in history and archaeology. The topography of any ancient city, for example, would be unrecognisable without its temples and shrines, its statues and votive offerings, its frequent public festivals and processions, and its generally familiar modes of worship. Such is the case in the novels, for all their differences, in which its characters range far and wide in the course of their wanderings and communicate with the sacred in these habitual ways, whether in the cities of Asia Minor (Ephesus, Miletus, Rhodes, Sidon, Byzantium), Egypt (Memphis, Thebes, Alexandria), Greece (Delphi, Corinth), Italy (Syracuse, Rome) or elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "forkomne, who are sterkt medtatt, halvt 0delagt (av utmattelse, kulde, fattigdom, drikk ell. lign.).2 In fact, forkommenhet is probably the most obvious and idiosyncratic component of Andersen's works.3 Furthermore, as might be expected, the majority of critical studies tend to stress this issue even those whose subject is ostensibly far afield (e.g., Frik Hougen's Andersens Opplandsfort elling er) which makes it stand out all the more. None of these studies, however, attempts to determine the cause of forkommenhet ; up to now, the approaches have been largely symptomatic.4 Thus the term has taken on a considerable number of nuances, so that an individual who is called forkommen may be lonesome, isolated, alienated, rootless, sick or degenerate (physically or mentally), passe, inactive, anxious, hopeless, down-and-out, morally depraved, or a variety of these traits.5 Much as this list of qualifiers might add to the meaning of forkommenhet , it does not bring us appreciably closer to an understanding of its cause. At times, of course, the cause may be readily apparent, as when physical illness is the sole debilitating factor (e.g., in D0den ombord and Faerdig), but these cases constitute an insigificant minority. Most important, as can be seen from the descriptive list of symptoms above, forkommenhet must be defined mainly as a disease of the spirit, a pernicious state of mind caused by psychic trauma, and its etiology is by no means obvious. Clearly, this pervasive and dominating yet critically unexplained malady requires investigation. Moreover, the results should provide more than just an etiology of forkommenhet , for the issues involved concern the basic needs of every Andersen character, not just the forkomne ones.

A man's variegated relationships with others run through his chattels as well as his land; and the measure of how far he feels the correct sentiments in those relationships is the way he deals with his property and his produce (Gluckman 1965: 45).The social life of objectsI am concerned here with the indigenous meanings attributed to a variety of \"objects\" among Pintupi-speaking Aborigines of the Australian Western Desert.1 My argument is that \"things\" (objects, ritual, land, prerogatives, duties) have meaning—that is, significance or social value—for the Pintupi largely as an expression of autonomy and what I have elsewhere defined as \"relatedness\" or shared identity (Myers 1986a). In this regard, landownership is not a special kind of property, not a special set of rights defining relationships to an ecologically necessary \"living space.\"2 Instead, it is one more form of objectifying social relationships of shared identity.Among the Pintupi, as among many hunter-gatherers, the use-value of rights to things is not at all obvious. Rather than, as Radcliffe-Brown (1930–31) once thought, corporate groups forming around some valued property or estate, Pintupi seem to constitute social aggregations (see also Sansom 1980) and give them identity through time by projecting them into shared relationships to objects.My essay begins, then, not so much in disagreement with Gluckman's views on property but in my discomfort with the notion of property as being too concrete and specific for the meanings that Pintupi give to objects. Legal language may be useful for characterizing certain similarities in the relationship between persons and things, but it does not make for entirely adequate translation. In exploration of this theoretical problem, and in search of deeper understanding of the social significance of things among hunter-gatherers, therefore, I want to focus on similarities and differences between land and other forms of property. The distinction on which I draw is not unlike the French contrast between propriété (personal property) and immeubles (real property), a contrast enshrined in Mauss' (1954) The gift and recently resurrected in Weiner's (1985) article, \"Inalienable wealth.\"Two basic issues arise. First, is land tenure different from relationships between (and among) people and other objects? Second, the question of concerns over temporal continuity is, according to Woodburn (1980) and Meillassoux (1973), central to understanding hunter gatherers. Whereas Woodburn attempted to locate the source of Aboriginal concerns over enduring relationships in the \"farming\" of women (in bestowal), I see the basis of temporal continuity in the process of objectification. In articulating this process, some sorts of objects have different capacities than others. It is of critical importance, as I shall show, that a Pintupi can \"give away\" (or share) some rights to named places without losing his or her own intrinsic identity with the place. This inalienability of land, that it cannot really be lost, differs from the way most other objects enter into processes of exchange.While these issues cannot be fully resolved here, I would like to begin by exploring the different ways personal identification with objects occurs in Pintupi social life. How is identity extended in the negotiation of shared rights to objects and processes of exchange? And why, for example, are \"personal effects\"—but not country—destroyed, effaced, and given away at death? What, if anything, is inherited, or what does inheritance accomplish?Ownership and identificationA basic issue at all levels of Pintupi social organization is transaction in shared identity. What is most impressive to me about the Pintupi conception of objects is the continual negotiation about relationships to them and a willingness to include others as what, for the want of a better heuristic term, I will call \"co-owners.\" Such ambiguity is deeply seated in the negotiated quality of much of Pintupi social life. Relationships among people are not totally given in the rules of a defining structure, not in landownership, kinship, or residence (Myers 1986a). Instead, the relationships must be worked out in a variety of social processes. The politics of Pintupi life, however, should not be confused with an aim for domination over others. Its roots lie in the emphasis placed on shared identity with others as a basis for social interaction.This framework suggests a simple and obvious conclusion, namely, that \"property\" be viewed as a sign. The immediate material use-value of most forms of propertied objects among the Pintupi (tools, clothing, food, etc.) is not great. While such objects are clearly useful, that which is necessary for simple production is rather easily obtained, constructed, or replaced. The rapidity and ease with which things move through a network of relatives and friends show that objects are important as opportunities to say something about oneself, to give to others, or to share. Like any signs, however obviously \"useful\" they might be, objects are tokens that represent an opportunity not so much to sustain exclusive use but to constitute other sorts of values defined by a larger system of exchange. That these values are ultimately convertible to labor or political support, far from subtracting from the significance of a semiotic analysis, suggests that such analysis should be based on a temporal perspective that focuses on value as being constituted in the process of reproducing social life.Analysis of the cultural relationships between persons and objects should begin appropriately with Pintupi ideas of \"ownership\"—a conception better translated as one of \"identification.\" The Pintupi words most closely approximating \"property\" in English are walytja or yulytja. While the former may be translated as \"relative(s)\" or as \"one's own personal effects\" (see Hansen and Hansen 1977: 152) and the latter as \"baggage and personal effects\" (ibid.: 190), the significance of identification is clearer when one understands the entire semantic range of walytja. In addition to objects associated with a person, it can refer to \"a relative,\" to the possessive notion of \"one's own\" (such as \"my own camp\" [ngayuku ngurra walytja] or \"my own father\" [ngayuku mama walytja]), or to reflexive conceptions like \"oneself\" (such as \"I saw it myself\" [ngayulu nyangu walytjalu] or \"He sat there by himself\" [nyinama walytja]).Examining this range of meanings offers some perspective on the almost natural reifying of legal conceptions of rights and duties in our common usage of \"property.\" Indeed, a similar foundation of property in rights deriving from some concept of personal identification is suggested by the shared root of \"proper\" (my proper father) and \"property\" in the Latin term proprius, \"private or peculiar to oneself\" (Partridge 1983: 529).There is a certain ambivalence or ambiguity about Pintupi relationships to objects. There is clearly a sense that objects might \"belong to\" someone—the idea that X is the walytja of a person contrasts directly with the idea that an object X is yapunta, a word whose literal meaning is \"orphan,\" without parents. To follow the linguistic usage further, one's parents are said to kanyininpa one, meaning \"to have,\" \"to hold,\" or, more loosely, \"to look after one.\" Thus, an object that is yapunta does not belong to anyone, but it appears that this might mean also that it has no one who is holding or looking after it. The question remains of what it means for something to belong to—to be walytja of—someone. An object becomes yapunta when it is no longer \"held,\" but has instead been wantingu, \"lost\" or \"relinquished,\" released from an active association with a subject. For objects to belong to someone means as much that they are expressive of that person's identity as it does that they are simply identified with or related to that person. To say that something is \"one's own\" implies, for the Pintupi, that one does not have to ask (or defer to) anyone about its use.Leaving aside for a moment the issue of co-owners, the right to use an object without asking—even the claim that it is \"my own\"—expresses one's autonomy. By \"autonomy,\" I mean self-direction, although we will have occasion to see that this is not necessarily self-created. In contrast, rights to objects that might be regarded, as personal effects still seem less exclusive among the Pintupi than Americans, for example, would tolerate. The very notion of ownership as identification provides also a sense that rights to objects can, and should, be more widely distributed, a willingness (not always ungrudging, of course) to include others with oneself as co-owners.Rights to objects enter into a system of exchange that constantly negotiates the relationships of shared identity. In the examples that follow, I want to show how negotiation of the meaning of ownership rights moves within a dialectic of autonomy (as in the right to be asked) and relatedness (exemplified in the tendency to include others and to share rights with others who one recognizes as identified). This sense of property as potentially providing a temporally extended objectification of shared identity has much in common with Sansom's (1980) treatment of fringe-dwelling Aborigines in Darwin as \"people without property.\"To share, perchance to giveLet me begin with a simple and striking example of how Pintupi regard personal possessions. Cigarettes, purchased through the cash economy, are a popular item among Western Desert Aboriginal men. Men cadge each other's tobacco and cigarettes almost without thought. Although my Pintupi comrades were generous with me in sharing their cigarettes, I often found my supply depleted all too quickly. On just such an occasion, a young man named Jimmy came to my camp and asked if I had any cigarettes. Aggrieved, I replied with some anger that people had taken all of mine, more or less including him in the group of those who had taken advantage of me. Rather than taking offense, he was sympathetic and offered me some of his cigarettes. Further, he took it upon himself to explain how I should not give my things away so easily. Instead, he suggested that I should hide what I had. He showed me how he had hidden a packet of cigarettes in his socks under his trousers and suggested that if I did the same, I could simply tell people that, unfortunately, I had no cigarettes—although I would surely give them if I had. Giving me a whole packet, Jimmy told me he had several buried near his camp.This example illustrates some common themes in Pintupi action about sharing, owning, and asking. I interpreted Jimmy to mean I did not have to refuse anyone overtly. It is clear that it is very difficult for Pintupi to simply refuse or to accept from others. Sympathy and compassion are the appropriate and moral responses to co-residents or relatives. Outright refusal, conversely, constitutes an open rejection of the other's claim to having a relationship with one (see Myers 1979). To \"say no to someone's face\" is something very unusual and dangerous in Pintupi social life. Those so denied may respond with anger and violence.Were Jimmy's buried cigarettes to be taken by others, he would certainly be angry. In similar cases, people talk of \"theft.\" That is, Jimmy might say, \"Someone has taken my cigarettes, mulyartalu (\"thieving\"; ergative case).\" Even though he might have been obligated on the basis of his relationship to a thief to give some cigarettes, to take \"without asking\" (tjapintja wiya) would be regarded as a violation of his personal rights to them. In other cases like this, people often argued that the owner got them with his own money. This is to say that the cigarettes were not a product of cooperative or joint activity through which others could claim identification with the product.No one else would be very concerned about such an event, as long as his or her ox was not gored. Indeed, it might be claimed, in counter, that Jimmy should not have hidden (yarkatjunu) his cigarettes, or, as I have heard in \"thefts\" of radios and cassette players, that he should have hidden them better (so the thief would not be tempted). Jimmy's claim would be that he should have been asked. Under such circumstances, in which refusal is impossible, the only way to maintain one's possessions is to place them out of immediate reach. To give one's cigarettes in response to a request, however, is to build a right to ask others because reciprocity in these matters is expected. By not asking, it would appear, one is doing more than simply taking an object; one is denying to the \"proprietor\" the opportunity to give it, that is, to be generous and to thereby build a debt. \"Theft,\" defined as taking without asking, is a serious interruption to one's ability to express the self, albeit through a gift, and to build through exchange an expanded, shared identity with the other.It is illuminating, finally, to reverse the conception offered here. Consider that one might claim a right to be given some object, claiming co-ownership or a relationship with the proprietor that obligated him or her to give. While the proprietor might choose to give, for propriety's sake, or to be diplomatic, he or she might still claim that the other was really \"nothing to do\" (mungutja)—having no basis for shared identity either with the object or with the proprietor.The exchange of foodIt is obviously not possible here to circumscribe the entirety of Pintupi relationships to things. Nonetheless, consideration of rights in food that is gathered or hunted can inform us more deeply about what is at issue in establishing one's primary identity with things.While women frequently forage for vegetable foods and small animals in a group, each woman has exclusive rights to what she produces when the actual productive activity is not cooperative. Much of her production is brought back to the residential camp for final preparation and consumption. Characteristically, women prepare what they collect themselves. In camp, the product is (1) shared with the immediate family, (2) given in exchange for child care services rendered, for example, while a mother was foraging (B. Clark, personal communication), and/or (3) distributed to co-residents who had not fared well. While such people may have claims on the producer's services, they have no special claim to the product itself. What she gives is conceptualized, therefore, as exchange. Although co-residents in this situation are expected to share with each other, the sharing often takes place only on request, giving to the distribution of production a character of \"mutual taking.\" Based on their technology and resources, cooperation in production among Pintupi men is unnecessary, though beneficial, in certain circumstances. When men engage in cooperative drives, the kill is distributed among all who participate. Most hunting, however, takes place alone or in small groups, and when a man is successful in hunting large game, it is distributed interdomestically, to those others in the residential group who have shared their production with the hunter. Gifts of meat could satisfy other exchange obligations as well, namely, to one's in-laws or parents.Anthropologists have frequently pointed out the practical economic benefits of such interdomestic distribution, so I need not emphasize that point here. In any case, the preparation of large game treats it as a social product. A hunter is supposed to give the kangaroo he kills to others for preparation, although his activity in the hunt provides for him the right and responsibility to direct disposition of the cooked animal in exchange (if he uses another's spear or rifle, the owner of the hunting implement has this privilege). Success in the hunt provides food for the hunter, of course, but this does not exhaust its significance. His success also secures a particular set of rights to the animal, providing him with an opportunity to give—to engage in interdomestic exchange that establishes or promotes a kind of moral identity with recipients.The social value of this exchange of meat is not simply that of caloric satisfaction. Rather, these exchanges among individuals provide a moral basis for continued and ongoing co-residence and cooperation among members of a group. They constitute, that is, a moment in the reproduction of shared identity (people who \"help each other\") that is the foundation of band organization. Failure to share or, as I would prefer to describe the activity, to exchange within such groups, has predictable consequences. The idiom of shared identity sustained through exchange provides the very basis of possible criticism: conflict ensues as those neglected make accusations of being rejected or neglected as \"relatives\" (walytja). Such neglect is understood as \"not loving,\" not regarding people as related.Distribution of foraging production in a large group does present a problem. Frequently, the conflicts that develop in such aggregations concern sharing and are brought on by the difficulty of allocating products and services among a large group of co-resident \"kin.\" Since all such co-residents have claims on each other, at least to some extent, large groups place a considerable strain on individuals, producing conflicts of loyalty as well as continuous imposition on one's generosity (not to say diminishing people's incentive to overproduction). Thus, the rights to the kangaroo as property are involved immediately with an exchange used to maintain one's relatedness to others. It is possible, of course, for a person to assert his (or her) autonomy, the right to decide who gets a kangaroo. Rights exist, but what do they mean? Insofar as exercise of choice may defy other people's claims about their relationship or obligations, these choices are likely to create a threat. Herein lies the tension between a valued autonomy and the claims and necessity of shared identity.How Pintupi people manage this tension is clear in a case of \"hidden meat.\" In 1979, I lived at the small outstation community of Yayayi, then, population 15. Having been successful the previous day in hunting kangaroos and bush bustards, we were enjoying the cooked fruits of our labor on one cold midmorning when we heard the approaching sounds of the tractor from the nearby community of Yinyilingki. Longtime and frequent co-residents with the Yayayi mob, the Yinyilingki people were close and often generous relatives only temporarily separated. To my surprise, the male leader of Yayayi decided we should hide our cooked meat, which we did, inside the many flour drums around the camp. When the Yinyilingki people arrived, they asked, of course, whether we had any meat. One of the Yayayi, Ronnie, sitting on top of some drums, replied that we were, unfortunately, empty-handed. His good friend from Yinyilingki, Ginger, was not fooled, since he could plainly see the evidence of recent cooking as well as the feathers we had plucked from the birds. Laughing and without any rancor, he opened a few flour drums until he found what he was looking for. Inescapably, for better or worse in his case, Ronnie's identification with the cooked meat truly spoke to the world about him—communicated, that is, about his identity. Nonetheless, the case is instructive about the cultural meaning of \"property\" as an expression of identity, a node of personal identity caught at once in webs of shared identity.Materially, Ronnie's strategy of the polite rejection through hiding was a failure, although it did not lead to the conflict or antagonism that shatters the sense of shared identity. I believe this is so because often enough he was generous. Indeed, the strategy of hiding one's property to avoid either having to give it away or having to overtly deny the other is a common enough practice. Ginger recognized Ronnie's rights to the meat, but these rights did not really sustain exclusive use. What Ronnie did with the meat was necessarily and unavoidably meaningful, a sign of their relationship, just as Ginger's jocular but insistent demand highlighted his sense of a closeness that allowed him to intrude. The potential dangers of such selfishness, however, are clearly outlined in Pintupi myths, where long cycles of vengeance follow on a constant failure to share. And conflict over food has altered the relationships in many Pintupi camps, so that the continued identity of a community, what the Pintupi call \"the people with one camp\" (ngurra kutjungurrara), is essentially a temporary objectification of these relationships of exchange.Motor vehicles as media of identificationAmong the most valuable objects in contemporary Pintupi life are motor vehicles, especially the trucks and four-wheel drive Toyotas that are able to carry large loads (and people) in difficult terrain. Vehicles are necessary and valuable for getting supplies from the store, for hunting expedition, and for visits near and far. The problem of ownership is compounded in the case of such objects, of which there are few, in that Pintupi recognize two categories of \"property\"—what they call (in English) \"private\" as opposed to \"community\" or \"company.\"Vehicles that are private are those purchased with money that belongs to an individual or, occasionally, to some individuals who jointly buy a car. The purchaser is understood to be the proprietor of the vehicle, that is, to have the right to decide on its use and nonuse. It is unlikely that the proprietor will be the sole user of a vehicle, but as in the case of other personal effects, relatives and friends must ask permission to gain its use. The very autonomy of ownership (the possibility of giving) is the basis for the establishment of extending shared identity with others. To have a car, one might say, is to find out how many relatives one has.Those without their own vehicles draw especially on their kin relations for help, placing those in possession of a car under almost constant pressure of such demands. Where the moral rubric of shared identity guides the relationships of those who live in the same camp, such requests are difficult to refuse, and open rejection is impossible. Those who refuse are said to be \"hard\" or \"jealous\" for the motorcar. Anyone who has lived in a Pintupi community will recognize just how much conflict, how many fights, are occasioned by relationships to motor vehicles because of misuse and requests for and refusals of use. Indeed, sometimes owners are relieved when their cars break down, only then seeming to be free of demands. Disputes among kin about the use of a vehicle have, I understand, led proprietors to set fire to and destroy their own cars as a desperate and angry resolution.In contrast, \"ownership\" provides an opportunity for a person to \"give,\" and one who helps his relatives is not only understood to be generous but also gains a degree of respect and authority for having \"looked after\" them. The demands on a proprietor are not entirely a bad thing, then, insofar as they provide one with an opportunity to \"be someone.\" Proprietorship can make a person central to the planning of activities that require transportation. More important, however, is the general attitude toward personal possessions. No matter what they cost, it would appear, Pintupi regard vehicles as replaceable, like spears or digging sticks. Thus, even when a $4,000 car is destroyed after only a few weeks of use, they say, \"There are plenty more motorcars; no worries.\" To be sure, this reflects an expectation that someone else will have a car, that another relative will help one to obtain the bare necessities—that is, an expectation of long-term reciprocity prevails.I believe this attitude to property underlies much of Pintupi social life. Put in familiar terms, if faced with a choice between caring for their property or for their relatives, they prefer to invest in people rather than things. Without granting this any special moral status, let me say that under the conditions of settlement in the traditional life of hunter-gatherers, such \"investment priorities\" may be a realistic appraisal of resources. Nonetheless, the conception of property as replaceable guides our attention to a conception of things as relatively transparent signs of social relationships, vehicles for another sort of value. Many Pintupi recognize a difference between their conception of the relationship between persons and things and that of whites. A long discussion I had with a middle-aged man resulted in his contemplating the difference thus: \"You white people are always worrying for money. You don't think about who will cry for you when you die.\" This is a salutary comment on commodity fetishism as Marx comprehended it. The accumulation of private objects, while not entirely ignored (Pintupi do work and save to get cars), is not the means through which one's identity is transmitted through time. That is secured in part through giving such things away.If it is difficult to refuse help, private cars are the basis on which a sort of shared identity is constructed, those with whom one shares the use reflecting an ongoing exchange. Pintupi themselves regard particular vehicles as representing a cluster of associates who, often for the life of the car, travel together: a certain blue Holden is \"that Yinyilingki motorcar,\" identified with a group of young men. The car is the occasion for the temporary realization of their relationship and obligations to each other. When driving past old wrecks on the road, Pintupi habitually identify them with the persons, communities, and events they were involved with. Cars become, in other words, objectifications of a set of social relationships.The other category of motor vehicle, the \"community\" one, has been the occasion for conflict and confusion in many settlements. Such objects are usually the product of government or foundation grants, not the result of a community's joint, voluntary contribution to a collective enterprise. The problem with community vehicles is, who actually can be said to own something that belongs to a community?Ordinarily, Pintupi have assimilated this problem of property to their ambiguous notion of kanyininpa (\"to have, to hold, to look after\"), and they recognize that Pintupi Village Councillors \"look after\" such vehicles. Indeed, in all the cases I have seen, a particular councillor assumes responsibility for a vehicle. \"Shorty,\" they might say, \"is looking after that Bedford truck.\" They do not mean, of course, that he is its \"owner.\" Their conception, as I understand it, is that Shorty must be asked, but conversely, as a Village Councilor he must help them. Although he might try to explain that there are other uses for the truck and try to relate these to everyone's benefit, he cannot really refuse.These community vehicles are interesting from another point of view. To the Pintupi who are granted them, such vehicles seem to embody a recognized \"community\" identity. When Pintupi refer to the Yayayi Toyota or the New Bore Toyota, they are saying more than that the vehicle belongs to that place. In a particular Pintupi sense, such objects represent the community's collective identity as an autonomous social entity. They do not do so, however, legally; if it crashes, the community is not held liable collectively, and individual members would undoubtedly claim that they were \"nothing to do\" (mungutja) with the action.For historical reasons, Pintupi associate the founding of past outstation communities with the granting of four-wheel drive Toyotas by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Fund. As a result of this association, it appears, they believe that a community's autonomy will be recognized in the granting of such a vehicle. Men often say that they are the \"boss\" of an outstation at such and such a place, but they are waiting to go there because the government has not yet given them their Toyota. Possibly, the attraction of gaining control over such a vehicle is the very reason that people have been eager to establish outstations. Much of the politics of autonomy that matter so much to men gets worked out around control of the motor vehicles of the community. At the first Yayayi community where l worked in 1973, there were two community vehicles, each associated with historically and geographically distinctive segments of the camp, one for the people \"from the east\" and the other controlled by those whose traditional country had been farther \"from the west.\" The controllers of these resources became the nodes of community organization.The ambivalence about proprietorship of community vehicles is made clear in the case of the death of a person who controlled a vehicle. When the \"boss\" at Alumbra Bore died in 1981, the community was faced with the problem of what to do with the orange Toyota that was theirs from a community grant. Personal property of a deceased is always destroyed or given away to that person's \"mother's brothers\" from far away, because a person's effects are identified with him or her and make close relatives sad. The Alumbra community planned initially to swap vehicles with another community in order to remove their truck from sight because it reminded them of the dead man. They eventually thought better of this, realizing they would still have to see this truck often since it would be in the area. They decided",

Similarly for other familiar objects: something that is a microscope could not have existed without being a microscope. Ordinary objects are nonredundant, in that they cannot be omitted from ontology without rendering ontology deficient. An inventory of what exists is incomplete if it leaves out persons, screwdrivers, houses, cats, or the other kinds of things that we routinely interact with.

There is no need therefore of any elaborate definings.

      "title": "Tracking objects, Tracking agents",
      "abstract": "Animals and humans have to keep track of individuals in their environment, both in perception (sensorimotor tracking) and in cognition (e.g., spatio-temporal localization and linguistic reference via memory, communication and reasoning). Items that are typical targets for tracking are things such as stationary physical objects (e.g., rocks, plants, trees, buildings, or attached artifacts), moving physical objects (e.g., animals, certain artifacts) and human beings. All such items are located in a spatial environment, persist over time, and are – or at least closely related to, in the case of conspecifics' bodies – physical objects that respect non trivial objecthood criteria such as having cohesive parts, following continuous spatio-temporal paths, or possessing causal powers and dispositions. Perceptually tracking these objects through space and over time requires possessing sensorimotor systems (e.g., the oculomotor system, the visuo-haptic system or the auditory system) that can anchor into and smoothly pursue objects' properties. Nonetheless, one may suspect that tracking intentional agents (i.e. creatures to whom it is natural to attribute intentional states such as beliefs, plans, desires, and who may even participate in shared intentionality), as opposed to physical objects without mental states (i.e. objects which are not intentional agents) exploits or requires further abilities and strategies. In particular, at least for humans, tracking conspecifics amounts to tracking intentional agents. This raises the question of how the perceptual tracking of non-intentional objects relates to the keeping track of intentional agents. Here, we propose an extension and augmentation of recent work on object-tracking to the tracking of intentional agents. Based on the examination of the elementary procedures available for pursing agency, our principal suggestions are as follows. First, identifying intentional agents is significantly dependent upon the perceptual abilities of physical-object tracking, and might therefore be explained by the ‘object-file' hypothesis (this hypothesis is explained in section 3), which we suggest to use in the study of the tracking of intentional agents (section 4). In the most elementary case, humans track intentional agents as physical objects: they track such agents by tracking their bodies (section 5). Even though this kind of tracking is insufficient for keeping track of human individuals ‘as' intentional agents (and explaining their behavior with an intentional stance), it may suffice to explain a number of interacting and situated behaviors in social contexts with intentional agents. Second, however, tracking intentional agents ‘as' intentional agents requires additional capacities for detecting and understanding intentional states and certain further properties which creatures with such states can exhibit (section 6) – e.g., (ir/)rationality, and the capacity to participate in shared intentionality. We note, however, that tracking a human individual as an intentional agent may require an appeal to specific perceptual cues and may even recruit basic sensorimotor skills – such as the detection of biological motions – whose tracking might be independent of the understanding of conspecifics' mental states. For reasons of parsimony and computational economy, unless we have reason to think that there is a separate system devoted to tracking intentional agents, we should suppose that the same mechanism used to track physical objects is recruited for tracking intentional agents.",

      "abstract": "There is experimental evidence that the direction of social, intellectual, physical, personality, and emotional development are determined more by events at certain stages than it is earlier or later. These stages have been called “critical periods. ”\r\n This artiecle reviews the evidence and interprets the experimental results for a general theory. Although most of the work reported here makes use of animal subjected, the main concepts can be applied, at least catiously to human development.\r\n The “critical period” concept can be considered to have four major components (Gordon Pryor, 1975).\r\n 1) “Critical periods” are usually assumed to occur prenatally or very soon after birth. This main emphasis is usually placed on early development when many changes are occurring at their most rapid rate.\r\n 2) “Critical periods” are assumed to occur during a relatively short time period in the developmental sequence-perhaps only a few hours, days, or at most weeks or months, depending upon the species and its total life span.\r\n 3) Effective endogenous or exogenous stimulation that occurs during a “critical period” is assumed to have long-lasting consequences on subsequent development.\r\n 4) Such stimulation is assumed to have little or no effect on the parameters in question when it precedes or follows a “critical period.”\r\n Freud had suggested the importance of early experience and pointed toward the existance of critical periods in human personality development.\r\n Though many experiments, it is clear that perinatal dietary restiction can have\r\nrather severe and Ion-lasting effects on subsequent development especially in brain.\r\n Some young birds-ducklings and chicks become attached to any object to which they are long exposed during the critical period, even when their contact is only visual.\r\n The barren environments of all sorts, including large and impersonal infant hospital and traditional orphanages for young children are emotionally and intellectually severely damaging to the child, and blunt the development not only of the human organism but of simpler nonverbal organisms such as rats, mice, dogs, and monkeys.\r\n The concept of critical periods is highly important for human and animal welfare. The dangers and potential benefits for each period of life are known, it should be possible to avoid the former and take advantage of the latter.\r\n The discovery of critical periods immediately focuses attention on the developmental processes which cause them. As these processes become understood, it is increasingly possible to deliberately modify critical periods and their results.",

      "title": "Vibrant Things",
      "abstract": "The root of the English word ‘object’ is a compound of the Latin prefix, ob, meaning in front of, and jacere, meaning to throw. This applies to the word both as a verb: to oppose, I object to [x], and as a noun: a “tangible thing, something perceived with or presented to the senses.”[1] In both cases, the definition of ‘object’ invokes a relationship between ourselves and the thing itself, in our sensing or perception of it. Perhaps because of this, it is easy to infer a human-centred definition in which the object is defined by our perception and exists for us; physical objects stop us, present obstacles for us to manoeuvre around, much like an objection: an argument presented in opposition. But what if objects are not obstacles, are not in opposition to us, are not primarily defined by our sensing or perception? My preference is for the latter half, the thrown-ness, jacere, of this etymology; objects present themselves to our senses, they throw (jacere) themselves in front of (ob) us. This definition accentuates an animacy in materiality, and an energetic lived relationality to all matter — if objects throw themselves in front of us, they arrive at us just as much as we arrive at them. Our senses are constantly being presented with objects, whether we register them or not. John, Virginia Woolf’s character in “Solid Objects,” is presented with objects (beach glass, broken porcelain, meteorite) that influence the course of his life. My visual art practice engages deeply with objects, and, like John, objects have influenced the course of my life. For this reason, object-theory resonates with me, as do stories like that of Woolf’s character for whom life is, in a sense, a series of object-relations. In this paper, I formulate a conceptual framework for an ontology of vibrant things to explore what I intrinsically already know: all matter is active, fluid, non-hierarchical, and in relation. I describe a shift where I theoretically and physically orientate myself to objects as vibrant things, speculate on how this orientation might be queer, and recount how these relations are registered in my art practice and research methodology through the process of casting.

      "abstract": "Disasters, often being sudden-onset and destructive events, produce unpredictable consequences that frequently lead to the separation of family members. People mention that separation from family members is one of the most stressful aspects of such events. Hazards may restrict physical access to an area, both during the threat period and afterwards due to the loss of transport infrastructure (e.g., roads), and communications may be disrupted directly or indirectly through loss of power. As a result of this disruption to people's ability to communicate with each other, many emergency management systems recognize the importance of reuniting families separated by disaster, and therefore provide a means for people to reunite (e.g., Safe and Well operated by the American Red Cross). 2 The term \"reunification\" is commonly used in the emergency sector. In this chapter, it refers to the point when someone becomes aware of their family member's status and whereabouts (e.g., through phone contact, word of mouth, Internet, face-to-face, or through the Red Cross); it does not necessarily involve being brought together in the same physical location. Despite the rationale for reunification services being supportive for people's wellbeing, there is little empirical evidence relating to the short-and longer-term psychosocial impact of separation from family members during and immediately after a disaster event.",

This prior work focused on collections of concepts, such as person-location-object triples. To explore this idea with complex materials, we created triples of people, locations, objects, or activities from events in real-world novels. People who had read one of the included novels were provided with one element from these triples (the cue) and asked to identify which of six alternatives best went with it. The results revealed that memory for the narrative events remained stable across many years. Moreover, people recalled events in a more holistic manner than would be expected by chance. This was more likely the more causally important an event was. This pattern of performance also remained stable over time. Our results are consistent with the idea that event models involve integrating separate elements into a single coherent representation, and this is likely to stay integrated over long periods of time. However, the degree to which this is so appears to be related to how well-integrated the information is within a larger set of events.",

      "abstract": "Only those whose work and interests have led them to notice it, will have realised, in all probability, the remarkable extent to which the term organization has gained currency, or acquired new and special emphasis, throughout the entire range of scientific and sociological literature during the last ten or twenty years. In biology and bio-chemistry organization has been discussed or used as a technical term, mostly since 1930 by at least thirty well-known authors; amongst the more prominent are Huxley, Wilson, Woodger, Cannon, Waddington, McDougall, Needham, Block, Hopkins and Sherrington. Under this magic term some authors refer to the physico-chemical nature of the cell or cytoplasm, and usually with special reference to selective or directive catalysis; others to the general constitution or structure of the organism and almost indistinguishable from general morphology and physiology; others to embryological development as such (i.e. progressive differentiation under specific chemical stimuli); others more especially to “relations” between cells, organs and structural parts, often in an abstract sense; others refer more particularly to a hypothetical integrating and/or co-ordinating factor (“entelechy', ”field“, ”formative force“, ”telepathic hierarchial monads“, ”diffused Maxwell's Demon“, and so forth): a few refer to re-constitution from dissociated cells (so-called ”re-organization“) as observed in experiments with Sponges and Hydroids.",

The requirement to respect the life of others is not subject to the variations which affect the value of the contents of the life of people. Our duty to respect people's life does not vary in scope or strength with variations in the value of the content of the life of those people. Possibly, it is somewhat sensitive to the value of those people's lives. We may not owe the same respect to the life of murderers as to the life of others.

      "title": "21st Century, Religius Century from Wasatiyah to Muwazanah",
      "abstract": "The 21st century is a religious century. Religion contains faith, resignation, oneness, and knowledge. Humans must believe, surrender, oneness of God, and be knowledgeable. The characteristics of faith include honesty (shidiq), amanah, tabligh, and intelligence (fathanah), while human characteristics include lust, the world, and shaitan. If the characteristics of humanity return to the characteristics of faith, it means that they have surrendered. If human beings worship God in a place to disperse Him, it means that he has been troubled, and that is unity. If humans have been in that place (where they are in a position), then they have known God, and that is knowledge. If everything has been done, it means that the human will be saved. So, why humans must be religious (faith, surrender, oneness, and knowledge) is due to saving themselves.\r\nHuman safety in the 21st century must be accompanied by the advancement of science and technology as a modern feature. Science and technology do not always move in a positive direction, sometimes leading to negative ones. Science and technology are often faced with basic questions about the path that must be taken and science and technology cannot answer it. The question is around the issue of science and technology control in order to continue to support human safety. The question of the human self must lead to the morality, meaning, and purpose of his life rooted in religion. Therefore, must present an ethical direction mechanism for the higher goals of human life\r\nReligion and modernity bring people to the future, and that future is salvation. Religion emphasizes the salvation of the world and the hereafter, while modesty promises the salvation of the world. If sees world life in preparation for entering the afterlife, modernity must not make people forget to build a better world. The fascination with the salvation of the world alone carries the risk of forgetting the purpose of life in the world and the hereafter. Thus, must be an effective guide to justify modernity.\r\nBack to religion in the 21st century which is supported by the advancement of science and technology (often called the digital era) requires a new paradigm in and knowledge. The paradigm appears in the form of revival of religions, both positive such as increasingly good and piety (al-bir and al-takwa), moral majority in the United States, and Terikyo in Japan and negative ones such as bad and hostility (al-itsm and al-'udwan). The rise of also means a change in ideas and actions (‘amal) from inwardlooking-wasatiyah outwarlooking-muwazanah. In essence, inwardlooking-wasatiyah is still considered important, but must be balanced positively with outwardlooking-muwazanah which is more promising and enhances the dignity of religious communities in the 21st century.",

      "abstract": "Humans are able to make inferences about objects’ potential animacy (i.e., are alive) and intentionality (i.e., have goals that they are attempting to meet) based upon reasonably simple visual movement patterns. One open question is whether humans are aware of the visual cues that they use to make such inferences, and if so, can humans employ these cues to mask their own agency and intentionality from other humans. We hypothesized that when participating in a competitive chasing task on a computer (one human chasing another), the “chaser” would avoid producing movement patterns that tend to trigger detection of intentionality by the “chasee.” In separate blocks of trials, participants (N=40 pairs) played the role of chaser (the “wolf”) and chasee (the “sheep”). The setup involved one red circle (the sheep; always controlled by a human participant) and many white circles (one of which was the wolf, the others were distractors), all moving in a large rectangular field. In some blocks, the wolf was controlled by a computer algorithm, and in other blocks, it was controlled by another human being. The wolf’s task was to catch the sheep. The sheep’s task was to avoid being caught. Consistent with previous work, when playing against a computer-controlled wolf, participants playing as the sheep often detected and avoided the wolf (in particular when the wolf was controlled by a direct-chasing or trajectory-interception algorithm). Conversely, when playing against a human-controlled wolf, participants very rarely escaped, with, as expected, the human-controlled wolves showing more complex movement patterns (and thus better disguised among the distractors) than the simple computer-controlled wolves. These results suggest that humans have some degree of awareness of the visual cues they use to make inferences about animacy and intentionality and are capable of masking those cues in their own behaviors.",

Certain sunsets, flowers, bird-songs, and beautiful bodies, among natural things, and certain pots, carvings, vocalizations, and marked surfaces, among humanly made things, seem to engage eye or ear together with attentive mind. In experiencing such things, we feel we want the experience to continue for “its own sake,” at least for some further time. Greek uses the phrase to kalon – the fine, the good, or the beautiful – to describe many sorts of things that are attractive to mind and eye or ear, without sharply distinguishing natural beauty from artistic merit (or moral goodness). In the Symposium, Socrates reports that the priestess Diotima once instructed him in how “a lover who goes about this matter correctly must begin in his youth to devote himself to beautiful bodies,” first loving one body, then many (as he comes to understand that they are alike in beauty), next beautiful minds, beautiful laws and customs, beautiful ideas and theories, until finally he will come to love “the Beautiful itself, absolute, pure, unmixed, not polluted by human flesh or colors or any other great nonsense of mortality.”",

      "title": "Features of the structural organization of the identity of the borderline personality",
      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the analysis of the features of the structural organization of individuals who are organized borderline. At the psychotherapeutic reception today, borderline organized personalities make up a significant proportion. The given data indicate that the proportion of such individuals in the population can reach 25%, and at least twice as much at the reception of a psychotherapist. Therefore, knowing the characteristics of these personalities is useful, and is the basis for successful psychotherapy. The personal identity of borderline individuals is described as diffuse: instability and variability of ideas about themselves and the world, values, goals, desires, inconsistent and contradictory behavior associated with the actualization of various \"split\" parts of their identity. Another important feature of such people is polarization - \"black and white\" perception, when he perceives himself and others either only as \"good\" or only as \"bad\": they are not able to perceive themselves and others in the unity of bad and good. Their world can either stably split into bad and good objects, or the same objects at one time are only good, and at another - only obnoxious. Such people do not have a stable and articulated self-concept, they do not know what they want, what they strive for, experiencing an “emptiness” that cannot be filled inside. This may manifest itself in the fact that they cannot decide on professional interests, areas of employment, choice of a partner, etc. At the same time, there is no description in the literature of specific phenomena of the organization of the identity of a person with a borderline organization. We used the case analysis, as such, which describes the individual feature of the structural organization of identity. As a result, specific features of the personal identity of borderline organized individuals were revealed: ego-dystonicity of some parts of the identity; their insufficient articulation; their irrational organization according to the type of mystery and magic; polarization and contrariety of parts of identity; their fantasies coming from some parts of their identity cannot be translated into reality; parts of identity exist in different chronological spaces, which deprives them of the possibility of communication and internal dialogue; the parts of the identity themselves are internally heterogeneous, contradictory, inconsistent; identity is characterized by the presence of some \"closed\" parts that are internally negatively connoted (shame, fear, etc.) and have no opportunities for manifestation.",

So much are we in the grip of this as the paradigm for discourse that, as noted in our first chapter, a good many theologians, upon hearing talk of God speaking, have concluded immediately that this is metaphor if not nonsense, on the ground that God has neither mouth nor tongue, vocal cords nor hands. Whether the attribution of speech to God is in fact either metaphor or nonsense is a topic I will address in a subsequent chapter. As preliminary for that, I propose to reflect here on the many modes of discourse. There are many ways of saying things other than by making sounds with one's vocal apparatus or inscribing marks with one's limbs.",

Belief in religion which is a source of morality and spirituality which is considered as part of a tradition that has never been abandoned by Indonesian society with situations and conditions of high spiritual values makes Indonesian people's belief in God and spirits that live around humans or those that smell mystical or black magic not uncommon in every region with their respective cultural characteristics, for example human rights violations in Banyumas Regency, namely the massacre allegedly carried out by black magic perpetrators with 250 victims. With this belief, it is not uncommon for people in some areas to have or even have the ability to see supernatural things or study black magic, for their own interests. So the question arises as a problem identification, namely 1. How are efforts to prove the crime of black magic according to Law Number 1 of 2023 concerning the Criminal Code? 2. How can the elements of black magic be called a criminal act based on Law Number 1 of 2023 concerning the Criminal Code? The research method used by the author is the normative legal approach method. The normative legal approach is a legal research conducted by examining library materials or secondary data as a basis for research by tracing laws and regulations and literature related to the problems studied by the author.",

      "title": "Stranger Anxiety: When Children Face Strangers",
      "abstract": "Till about seven months, the baby mostly flees from contact with strangers, often avoiding eye-contact without the parent’s awareness. A reaction of resistance and anxiety when approached by a stranger is commonly seen around eight months. In this paper I explore this emotional responding in the context of a novel re-conceptualization of healthy narcissism processing as an emotional immune system. Whereas recent discussions in the literature have focused on the anxiety reaction, I propose that key to understanding this commonplace phenomenon is the understanding of how healthy narcissism works to safeguard that which is familiar and resist that which is strange. The operation of these psychic processes may be likened to those of the biological immune system, which safeguard the familiar codes of the body and repel alien invaders. In safeguarding that which is familiar and repelling the alien, healthy narcissism operates as an emotional immune system. It is promoted by good-enough attachments (object relations) characterized by our being loved the way we are (true self), in separateness and not according to someone else’s blueprint (false self), one that risks invading our familiar self. The more we are loved for who we truly are, our self-integrity is more immune to invaders, and throughout our lifespan, we are more immune to alien influences, and to the incursions of others’ hurtful words and deeds. Healthy narcissism is thus understood as providing, from birth, emotional immunity to our sense of self-familiarity. We come to recognize ourselves and the partners of our various relationships via continually being alerted to and subsequently resisting or rejecting strangers/strangeness (i.e., invaders), and by gradually tolerating and even befriending the otherness. Befriending is possible when we are able to discover some familiarity embedded within the stranger. The appearance of eight-month resistance/anxiety, a normal alertness to strangers, signals that the baby has a rudimentary sense of both self and object constancy and is able to differentiate between his familiar “not-I,” such as the parent/caregiver whom he experiences as familiar and is attached to, and the unfamiliar “not-I” stranger. The parent/caregiver is then experienced as a bridge between that which is familiar and that which is strange and anxiety-provoking/overwhelming. Parents’ reactions to the “not-I” (of their baby) can help the infant differentiate between a “not-I” he might befriend, and one that is best avoided. The normal emotional immune reaction reflects a good-enough balance between preserving the familiar and true self, and befriending the otherness, to which one remains appropriately but not excessively alert.",

This question recalls another one, asked by Plato: are things pious because God loves them or does God love them because they are pious? The answer at first seems easy: value (or at least need) precedes money. But maybe it is not so. Of course, when we handle money we have the impression that it has value because the community in which we live feels that it does. But it is difficult to ignore the fact that when I handle money, I have the impression that the value lies in the money, not in my head: I may have wrong theories on money, or no theory at all, without compromising the value of the note I am holding. This is a psychological and philosophical enigma to solve: if money had value because we thought it did, why is it not enough to change our mind for it to lose value? And if we are not the ones who give money its value, then who is?",

And one way in which we respect persons is by respecting their wishes, desires, decisions, choices, ends, and goals. I will call all of these things ‘aims.’ Sometimes we respect another person's aims simply by refraining from doing certain things, such as treating her in ways that thwart her aims, or interfering with her attempt to pursue them. Other times we respect a person's aims by taking positive action to help her pursue them. But how exactly does respect for persons translate into respect for their aims? And which aims merit respect?

It demonstrates the epistemological inferiority, even uselessness, of the psychologists' approach. Anxiety and fear belong to so-called general feelings (<i>Gemeingefühle</i>). Fear is an atavistic emotional heritage serving protective purposes against a threatening event, impending danger, or risky performance. This psychological emotion is a cortical function with repercussion on the diencephalic autonomic nervous system. Alteration of respiration, pulse rate, or blood pressure; blushing or pallor; inhibition of salivary secretion; or weeping are witness thereof. Anxiety is fear without extrinsic cause, without a substratum, not fear of something. It is an autonomous feeling aroused by intrinsic cortical processes, conscious or subconscious memories and associations originating from past experiences and life situations. It is a pathological outlet of mental processes involved",

      "title": "Grading, A Study in Semantics",
      "abstract": "The first thing to realize about grading as a psychological process is that it precedes measurement and counting. Judgments of the type “A is larger than B” or “This can contains less milk than that” are made long before it is possible to say, e.g., “A is twice as large as B” or “A has a volume of 25 cubic feet, B a volume of 20 cubic feet, therefore A is larger than B by 5 cubic feet,” or “This can contains a quart of milk, that one 3 quarts of milk, therefore the former has less milk in it.” In other words, judgments of quantity in terms of units of measure or in terms of number always presuppose, explicitly or implicitly, preliminary judgments of grading. The term four means something only when it is known to refer to a number which is “less than” certain others, say five, six, seven , arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses , and “more than” certain others, say one, two, three , arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses. Similarly, a foot as a unit of linear measure has no meaning whatever unless it is known to be more than some other stretch, say an inch , and less than a third stretch, say a yard.",

      "title": "The Sting of Intentional Pain",
      "abstract": "When someone steps on your toe on purpose, it seems to hurt more than when the person does the same thing unintentionally. The physical parameters of the harm may not differ your toe is flattened in both cases but the psychological experience of pain is changed nonetheless. Intentional harms are premeditated by another person and have the specific purpose of causing pain. In a sense, intended harms are events initiated by one mind to communicate meaning (malice) to another, and this could shape the recipient's experience. This study examined whether self-reported pain is indeed higher when the events producing the pain are understood as intentionally (as opposed to unintentionally) caused by another person. Although pain was traditionally conceived to be solely physical in nature (Aydede, 2005), its experience varies substantially with psychological context. The placebo analgesia effect, for example, is the reduction of pain without a change in physical stimulation when context, expectations, or sugar pills challenge the interpretation of a sensation as painful (e.g., Fields, 2008). The nocebo effect, in turn, is the experience of pain without any physical stimulation as when participants report headaches when told that a (nonexistent) electric current is passing through their heads (Schweiger & Parducci, 1981). These variations in pain experience seem to depend on the meaning of the stimulus: A sugar pill is meant to decrease pain, whereas electric current is meant to increase pain. In an interpersonal context, the meaning of an action is derived from the perceiver's perceptions of the actor's intention (Clark, 1996), which means that intentional harms, unlike accidental harms, are meant to cause pain. The possibility that the malicious intent of other people could be translated into additional physical pain is suggested by studies demonstrating that similar areas of cortex respond to both physical pain and social harms (Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003). Social harms, which are presumably laden with intention, have also been shown to be more painful to relive than simple physical harms (Chen, Williams, Fitness, & Newton, 2008). So, although a broken toe (or electric shock) may hurt, an intentionally broken toe (or electric shock) should hurt more. METHOD",

      "abstract": "Recently, in the public space and then in judicial practice, a new solution has been discussed regarding the legal qualification of the act of a person who, after consuming alcohol and/or drugs, while driving a motor vehicle, causes an accident resulting in the death of a person, in the sense that it would not be an offence of manslaughter but the offence of murder committed with indirect intent. In this hypothesis, the major question is raised as to the capacity of thinking, of critical judgment, of the person who consumed alcohol and/or drugs, in the sense specified by the courts, which found that these persons foresaw and accepted the possibility of an uncertain event – the road traffic accident – occurring, that these persons based their choice on possible, unconfirmed aspects and thus foresaw and accepted the possibility of an event resulting in the death of persons. In our opinion, such a person not only does not accept the possibility of such an outcome, because he or she believes (under the influence of the substances in question) that it cannot happen to him or her, but also that he or she has the skills and possibilities to avoid such an event.",

      "title": "Beneficence/Benevolence",
      "abstract": "I begin with a note about moral goodness as a quality, disposition, or trait of a person or human being. This has at least two different senses, one wider and one narrower. Aristotle remarked that the Greek term we translate as justice sometimes meant simply virtue or goodness as applied to a person and sometimes meant only a certain virtue or kind of goodness. The same thing is true of our word “goodness.” Sometimes being a good person means having all the virtues, or at least all the moral ones; then goodness equals the whole of virtue. But sometimes, being a good person has a narrower meaning, namely, being kind, generous, and so forth. Thus, my OED sometimes equates goodness with moral excellence as a whole and sometimes with a particular moral excellence, viz., kindness, beneficence, or benevolence; and the Bible, when it speaks of God as being good sometimes means that God has all the virtues and sometimes only that he is kind, mereiful, or benevolent. When Jesus says, “Why callest thou me good: None is good, save one, that is God,” he seems to be speaking of goodness in the inclusive sense, but when the writer of Exodus has God himself say that he is “merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,” God is using “goodness” in the narrower sense in which it means benevolence, for he goes on to make it clear that he is also just and severe. Similarly, “good will” may mean either “morally good will” in general, as it does in Kant, or it may mean only “benevolent will,” as it usually does; in “men of good will” it is perhaps ambiguous.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "Informally, an event is something that has happened, is happening, or is expected to happen. In philosophy, an event can refer to a material phenomenon where some object changed its property, or a mental phenomenon like the occurrence of an emotion or thought. In the past decade, many different communities have defined concepts, technologies, and systems that relate to events, and they cover wide ranged areas in Computer Science including languages, databases, and communication systems [Voisard and Ziekow, 2011]. In this book, we consider events as real-world occurrences that unfold over space and time; they are observable occurrences of some phenomena that have either been explicitly recorded (e.g., \"the ad hoc committee meeting occurred at 3pm on Thursday,\" as recorded by a person), or can be computed (\"John entered room 303 through the west door\" based on the computation from motion detection and face recognition routines). Typically, given a collection of events, one would want to know things like: \"What happened in this event? When and where? Who was involved and how? How did it happen? What other events is this event related to and how? Who detected and reported it? What is the evidence that the event actually occurred? Does this event lead to any consequences? How do people (and machines) react to this event?\" Questions like these are important in a wide variety of domains. Surveillance applications [Tian et al., 2008a] consider events like entries into and exits from a monitored space, intrusion in a prohibited regions and so on. RFID based tracking applications [Welbourne et al., 2008] consider \"movement events\" of objects from one place to another. Research projects on lifelogging such as the MyLifeBits project [Gemmell et al., 2006] from Microsoft records personal events of an individual, including the images and videos collected by the individual to capture their personal experience of events. Another class of applications, called experiential applications, focus on event-based access to live streaming multimedia information [Gupta et al., 2004]. In this case, a user might want to gain access to the live feed of a meeting when a specified event occurs. In each case, the ultimate goal of the system is to allow a user to access, search, explore, correlate, annotate, and get insight from a web of events and all their associated data.",

First, it may be considered as a combination of goal-oriented operations by means of which material objects take a particular shape according to given specifications, or immaterial services are supplied. Second, productive activity may be described as a combination of ‘transformation stages’ (usually a sequence), which leads material objects or human capabilities from a state of nature that is conventionally considered as original to a different state of nature that is conventionally considered as final. Last, productive activity may be identified with those human and non-human factors that must be available within each productive unit if some process of ‘technical transformation, or production’ (Hicks, 1939: 78) has to take place.",

      "abstract": "Locomotion is the movement of an organism from one place to another, often by the action of appendages such as flagella, limbs, or wings. In some animals, such as fish, a lumbering locomotion results from a wavelike series of muscle contractions (The American Heritage® Science Dictionary, 2005). Walking is travelling by foot; gait is the manner of locomotion; running is the act of travelling on foot at a fast pace; crawling is a slow mode of hand-knee or hand-foot locomotion. Walking on all four extremities (quadrupedal locomotion, QL) is the trait of the quadruped animals. Non-primate mammals usually utilize lateral-sequence QL, in which the hind limb touchdowns are followed by the ipsilateral forelimb touchdowns (symmetric gait). On the contrary, the non-human primates usually utilize a diagonalsequence QL, in which the hind-limb moves with the contralateral forelimb in a diagonal couplet (asymmetric gait). Interestingly, only the animals exhibiting the diagonal-sequence QL with symmetrical gait evolved towards species with enlarged brains associated with highly complex neural circuits, till the emergence of human beings. The animals exhibiting lateralsequence QL did not show such a phylogenetic progress compared to those with diagonalsequence QL. Figure 1 shows the differences between lateral-(left) and diagonal-sequence (right) patterns of QL.",

      "title": "Sculpture: Growth Structures",
      "abstract": "For the past two years I have been making what I call 'growth structures', which are small constructions made by combining together equal-sized units of metal, wood or plastic according to certain rules. When I begin a piece, I have only a vague idea as to how it will appear when completed. The problem I posed for myself was to do justice to my sense of the variability of life and to combine spontaneity with calculation. I decided to make structures whose bounds would be variable and each new part of which would be determined by a species of genetic ordering. The method of construction I use varies but it has the following general outline. First, I select a unit or element, such as a short bar of steel or a square piece of Perspex. In the past I favoured very simple shapes for the units but more recently I have made works from curved tubes. Second, I try various possible relationships or 'joints' between the units. I use up to five different types of joints in one structure. Then I choose a rule of ordering the joints between units, e.g. nine units to be connected by three types of joints and each type to occur at least twice. Or I may decide that a number of small groups should be made first using joints of type A and B and that they should be linked together with joints of type C and D. Sometimes I choose the sequence of joints randomly before assembling a piece but, of course, such a structure may not be possible to make. When a specific rule is selected, there may be several arrangements of the units that obey it. I am then confronted with the question as to which arrangement or arrangements are aesthetically satisfying to me and, hopefully, to others. This method of working allows the isolation of each decision and enables me to evaluate a piece as it is being made. Some of the decisions are innovative, some are not, and I treat subjective evaluations as though they were objective ones.",

      "title": "A striking take on mass inferences from collisions",
      "abstract": "Our everyday activities – e.g., packing groceries, building sandcastles – require knowledge about the physical properties of the objects and surfaces in our environments. We often learn about properties such as weight, hardness, and slipperiness by interacting with the world, but we also learn about latent physical properties by observing events. Among the best-studied examples is people’s ability to infer objects’ relative masses based on seeing them collide, and work on this front has shown that people’s inferences sometimes show marked biases. For example, when an incoming object strikes a stationary one, people consistently overestimate the mass of the incoming object. Why? Various accounts attribute the effect to heuristics that fail in certain conditions, simplified stimuli that lack realistic cues, or a characteristic of rational Newtonian decisions made under sensory uncertainty. Here we sought to disentangle these competing accounts by asking observers to judge the relative weights of bowling balls in videos of real collisions. Balls ranged from 6 to 16 pounds; subjects saw all possible pairings and reported whether the incoming ball or the initially static one was heavier. Under these realistic conditions, participants still consistently overestimated the incoming ball’s weight. We found reliable individual differences in the size of this bias, and in overall performance in weight discrimination. While weight discrimination performance was predictive of intuitive physics abilities in general (assessed with an independent task battery), bias in weight estimation showed no relationship, suggesting it is not a hindrance in other tasks. In a final experiment, we occluded cues in the videos that the purported heuristics would rely on, and we found it had little impact on overall weight discrimination or bias. Our results argue against accounts based on heuristics or oversimplified stimuli and support the idea that the bias is a characteristic of a well-tuned Newtonian system.",

Others lean toward rationality, examining principles and analyzing nagging questions, evaluating the appropriateness of names and their correspondence with the realities to which they are attached. Such people are exemplified by the rational approach to principle and [the Classics taken during the Sung] and by philosophers. If one follows pure emotions. then all matters might be honorable and virtuous, but implicit is the defect of stupidity. If one follows a pure rationality, then all things might be understood and put in order, but implicit is the defect of distortion.

To help remedy this odd neglect, the author postulated the protective motive as a biologically given “thrust to wholeness,” modified by experience and dependent on social support. Utilizing mechanisms of homeostasis, defense, prevention, healing, and “outreach” (i.e., wholeness expressed), the motive disposes the individual to maintain and express the functional integrity of body and self (including “all that is mine”). Seemingly unrelated phenomena (e.g., immune response, quest for immortality, forgiveness, sharing, urge to procreate) are thus afforded common explanation. Prospectively, the thrust to wholeness affords conceptual unity, parsimony, and pedagogical utility. Also, it may furnish a conceptual anchor for well-being and its paradoxes, self-defeat and suicide.",

      "abstract": "As an operative force, the well-known mechanism of catharsis (cleansing, elimination, purification, purge, purgation of emotion, epuration...) can easily be used or misused, depending on the context of its appearance. A mediating question would be whether this mechanism is set in motion spontaneously, or if it must be seen as almost always assembled and constructed. What are the conditions in which it appears? Can it be elicited anywhere, at any moment? Can it be set in motion by anyone? In order to fulfill its purpose as an artistic practice, and thus to have a far-reaching impact, it needs to be conceptually unobtrusive and inconspicuous. Conversely, with its improper use, any content aiming to convince, to leave an impression or an imprint of authenticity, can be viciously exposed to ridicule or scorn. Worse, it can lose its credibility altogether. Briefly, my thesis is that the use or misuse of the mechanism of catharsis (I would dare to contend – even of affect itself as the power of performing) is directly tied to the functionality or disfunctionality of a community, which in our case means a community with democratic aspirations.",

      "title": "Reaching Sideways, Writing <i>Our</i> Ways",
      "abstract": "Ruth Simbao: In Rehema Chachage's video installation, Kwa Baba Rithi Undugu (2010), sculptural objects representing old-fashioned transistor radios are mounted on the wall, side by side (Fig. 1). Embedded in each radio is a small video screen, which reveals a figure who stands in one place while the vertical line of the radio tuner crosses her body in search of the desired frequency (Figs. 2–3). A man's voice wafts in and out as it is periodically interrupted by unsolicited noise, revealing the difficulty of relating to others when sound is interrupted or there is an absence of voice. Voice, writes Chachage, is a “prerequisite for interlocution and the construction of discourse.”2 This work engages with the assertion that to “live means to participate in dialogue: to ask questions, to heed, to respond, to agree …” and to do so full heartedly with your “eyes, lips, hands, soul, spirit … whole body and deeds” (Bakhtin 1984:293).3Rehema Chachage, a Dar es Salaam-based artist who works with video, installation, and performance, explains that her work is predominantly determined by her situatedness. Her early work draws from her time spent as a student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa and she describes experiencing this situation as a “‘cultural foreigner’ and a non-South African, black female student in a predominantly white middle class … institution.” At this time, she says, her work was produced from “the point of view of a stranger, the outsider, the other, alien and often voiceless.”4Chachage's concern with dialogue and voice in Kwa Baba Rithi Undungu serves as an effective inroad into a multivocal conversation in the context of a scholarly journal, for “Without dialogue there is no communication, and without communication there can be no true education” (Freire 2005:92–93). Dialogue, writes Paolo Freire (2005:88–91), is about horizontal relationships; it is an existential necessity and an act of creation rather than an instrument of domination of one person over another. When one listens to a radio, voices can be tuned out selectively. Opinions exist as waves out there, but statements can be blocked with the turn of a dial. At times there is a crackle—a disruption of signal or an interference caused by the receiver. If one were to hold an old transmitter radio, one could attempt to receive better sound if one moved around, changing one's orientation.This multivocal dialogue reaches sideways as it opens up the dominant international discourse5 of the arts of Africa to include a higher percentage of voices from the African continent. (Participating writers are based in Zambia, Nigeria, Benin, Zimbabwe, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, the US, Egypt, Tanzania, and Angola/Portugal.) This sideways reach registers the importance of intracontinental conversations in Africa that are sometimes missing from internationally visible scholarship on the arts of Africa, and it asks how scholars in the global South and the global North6 can benefit from a reconsideration of what the predominant orientation of our scholarly discourse is.A common understanding of the word “orientation” is one's position relative to, for example, the points of the compass, and its meaning in the nineteenth century was the “arrangement of a building etc. to face east or another specific direction.”7 The etymology of “orientation” links the word historically to the notion of facing East (hence the label of “the Orient” for “places in the East”), implying a particular position from which one views the world and thereby develops a certain standpoint. This dialogue attempts to encourage an understanding of orientation that situates speaking positions and gives credence to the physical positioning of knowing subjects, whilst also expanding beyond physical coordinates, seeking richer understandings of the orientation of our research.What is the orientation of the international discourse of the arts of Africa in the twenty-first century and what position do we see this discourse in relation to? In what ways might it matter that the vast majority of authors in journals such as African Arts and NKA: Journal of Contemporary African Art are based in the North? (See “Situating Africa: A Geopolitics of Knowledge, or Chapungu Rises” in this issue). In his thought-piece “What Is an African Curriculum?” Harry Garuba (2015) discusses the activism of James Ngũgĩ (now Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o), Henry Owuor-Anyumba, and Taban Lo Liyong at the University of Nairobi who fought for the decolonization of the curriculum in the 1960s. Garuba (2015) argues that it was “place, perspective, and orientation” that needed to be addressed in order to position “Kenya, East Africa, and Africa” at the center of knowledge-production in newly independent Kenya. In this current moment of revived activism in Africa regarding the “politics of knowing” (Ngũgĩ 2012), what can we learn about historical calls for reorientation? Are there ways that we can hear contributions of other scholars more effectively if we adjust our orientation? Can we reduce the crackle that sometimes surfaces in the discourse if we shift our respective positions?This dialogue places an emphasis on the voices of scholars, artists, and curators based on the African continent, as it marks the start of an Africa-based editorial consortium partnership with African Arts.8 The dialogue is neither definitive, nor complete. Instead, it is a departure point that invites further conversation from people who, together, desire to learn more than we now know about our field of research and our respective roles in generating new knowledge. What is our view on the strength of the current scholarship on the visual and performing arts, and from what standpoint have we developed this view? How can we discuss various orientations and in doing so work towards generating scholarly knowledge and artistic practice that is more rigorous and diverse, and is relevant to different locally embedded and interconnected contexts?William B. Miko: Africa is like an absent landlord in most dialogues and discourses relating to her own arts. This African Arts discussion aims to turn a new page on scholarship and knowledge-generation, which has largely been produced and propagated by and with an “outsider's” point of view. Usually, when an opportunity for an African scholar arises to study the arts of the continent, the curriculum that is used remains foreign, thereby shrouding scholarship and keeping the knowledge of Africans in obscurity. How can an African scholar living and working on the continent today still ascribe to and perpetuate this status quo? (By “African” I mean every scholar living on the African continent or in the African diaspora, without engaging in dichotomies of skin color, creed, or ethnicity). The question is: Who needs to shift the production of knowledge about Africa and what are the engines and spaces of production of this knowledge? As I discuss further below, it is critical for Africans to be at the forefront of this shift.Eyitayo Tolulope Ijisakin: While one cannot but give credence to some Africanists and non-African writers who have played a role in laying the foundation for scholarship in the visual and performing arts of Africa as an internationally recognized field of research, it is critical to acknowledge that the West still largely dictates the rhythm of art scholarship in postcolonial Africa. Many critics and art historians (including some African scholars residing in the West) continue to apply predominantly Western considerations to the analysis of “contemporary African art.” Furthermore, a number of African artists who are celebrated in the West are not particularly popular or well-known in their own countries in Africa. Their works are seen as visual representations of African thought, but in some ways this gives an inaccurate impression of African intelligence and artistic dexterity.In rethinking the ways in which Africa is positioned in relation to the arts and beyond, I strongly suggest the use of the philosophies of African people in the critical discourse and analysis of their arts. African subject matter and cultural symbols that are deeply meaningful to an expression of African identity should be engaged with more often, and in my view it is only the person who is deeply immersed in a particular culture that is well-placed to advance the purpose of that research.At this point, we have not seen the emergence of sufficient momentum and quality of scholarship that could meaningfully challenge and positively shift this Western dominance. This is partly due to the challenges scholars on the continent face in terms of publishing, such as inadequate financial support and limited publishing outlets. Locally produced publications that meet international standards and benefit from the visibility of wide geographic distribution are rare. That said, scholarship and artistic practice that is rigorous, diverse, and meaningful, I think, can be generated by African scholars.Romuald Tchibozo (translated by Jean-Sylvain Tshilumba Mukendi): I don't think that much has fundamentally changed in recent years regarding Africa's positioning in the world. Our fellow researchers in Africa haven't progressed sufficiently, and researchers based in the South continue to be viewed as appendices to research programs developed elsewhere. Research projects are often formulated without consultation, and without cooperative agreements regarding the mutual interests of both parties. The result is that other people write and think on our behalf. In my opinion, there is only one thing to do: we need to create research funds on the continent and facilitate work exchanges between Southern-based researchers in order to formulate new concepts. This has the potential to meaningfully change the gaze of other scholars and to shift the global positioning of African researchers and artists.We need to develop a better overview of the various platforms that grant scholarships in Africa, and it is important to share knowledge about funding that is specifically for writers and practitioners who are based on the African continent. This would play a significant role in challenging the perception that one needs to be located outside of Africa in order to be recognized. Scholarship-holders and other scholars could develop broad research themes every three years, and by identifying active researchers we could collaborate more and move beyond hierarchical differentiations between African researchers who are from different African contexts and who speak different languages. We could also develop a professional association of international standing in Africa that is able to defend theoretical and conceptual choices regarding the study of the arts in Africa.William B. Miko: Returning to my earlier point about Africans being at the forefront of shifts in knowledge production, I provide a relevant example from my own context in Zambia. Zambia gained independence over fifty years ago, but until 2010 there was not a single university that offered a Fine Arts degree. The Zambian Open University (ZAOU), which was founded in 2005, created the first university-level arts degree at the School of Media, Performing, and Fine Arts. With tenacity in the face of much doubt, I played a key role in establishing this Open Distance Learning (ODL) art school. Many argued that art cannot be taught in an ODL system, but in my view this perpetuates established colonial notions of education designed to prevent the “other” from excelling.Colonization has its own fair share of mental constrictions in the formerly colonized person's mind. What is from the West is often perceived as good even if it was initially taken from Africa, repackaged in the West, and brought back to the continent. Unfortunately some contemporary artists hold this viewpoint and think that it is more prestigious to study abroad, and they have little knowledge of their own national art history.Students at the ZAOU art school learn through a combination of contact periods and distance learning, and we bring together formal university education and engagement with the non-formal sector and practicing artists. During contact periods we visit local art collections and art platforms, such as Chaminuka Lodge, the Lusaka National Museum, Namwandwe Gallery, Lechwe Trust, Henry Tayali Centre, and Twaya Art Gallery. We also visit many artists’ studios and community-based art initiatives. The academic progression observed in students has been amazing—one has to see this modus operandi in motion to believe in its success in a developing nation with limited resources. My philosophy is, “It can only be done for you if you do it yourself; the rest will join in on the way.”The first cohort of students graduated in September 2014, and to mark this momentous event I produced a public performance with my students at the graduation ceremony in Lusaka. I purchased a new white Pier Luigi suit, and during the ceremony the graduating students transformed the suit into a “human canvas” with paints and brushes hidden in their graduation gowns (Fig. 4). Dancing to traditional music performed by the theater and drama students, they signed their names on the suit, registering their role in creating a new space in the production of academic knowledge in the arts. Some of these undergraduates are currently pursuing their Master's degrees, and together we are asserting ourselves by generating scholarship, knowledge, and artistic practice that is rigorous and relevant—first to ourselves in Zambia and secondly to the rest of the world.Ruth Simbao: At this critical time of ongoing and revived calls on the African continent for decoloniality, it is evident that not enough has changed in terms of the way the world imagines, views, frames, and consumes Africa, subsuming the complexitites of its numerous contexts. How can we continue to rethink the ways in which Africa is positioned in relation to the broader artworld? To what degree do external forces continue to shape artworks, artists, and theories, and what alternative forces already exist? Whose agency is exerted and recognized? As Masimba Hwati asks: Who pushes the wheelbarrow?Masimba Hwati: The way that Africa and its contexts continue to be imagined and seen by other groups of people is problematic, because commercial motives tend to lie at the heart of political and cultural engineering of representations of Africa. Due to ongoing perceptions of Africa as a dangerous and poor place, artists from Africa are burdened with the political pressure to appease the ill-informed appetites of collectors and curators. Being an African artist or an artist from an African context is often a negotiation of history itself and a constant navigation of the various images associated with the word “Africa.” In my engagement with different Occidental cultural platforms, I find that sometimes people view my artwork through distorted lenses. At times this challenge can transform into positive processes of dialogue that can become an extension of the work.Unfortunately, there remains a persistent preconceptualization of art from Africa as “tribal,” “ritualistic,” and “functional.” This does not mean that Occidental authors have not played a positive role in negotiating the image of Africa as a cultural space. There are quite a number of credible critical reviews on art from Africa by various writers who are not from Africa and who succeed in countering erroneous images. However, the onus also rests on writers on the African continent to challenge certain bodies of knowledge created about Africa, and it is critical that this is not just done in a reactive way, but in proactive ways such as creating more critical platforms that are not insular in nature but are inclusive of multiple audiences.This raises important questions around the definitions and parameters of curatorship as an institution and its potential to reform or to perpetuate the problematic images of the African continent, which has become a cultural albatross. This question becomes critical as we explore the sources of funding that are available for some of the major curatorial projects on the continent. Most funding from former colonial masters’ countries creates a fundamentally problematic situation for the arts on the continent in terms of agency and dependency, hence the need for more African-funded curatorial projects on the continent. Many foreign policies treat the African continent as an entity that moves only by external pressure.In my artwork I use the wheelbarrow to symbolize a lack of agency, as it is an inert apparatus that requires external force to move it. The wheelbarrow appears in the form of a wheelbarrow-table in the installation Don't Worry, Be Happy exhibited in “Consuming Us” at the 2016 Cape Town Art Fair [see p. 7, Fig. 10 in this issue]. It also appears in the installation “Rinamanyanga Hariputirwe” exhibited at SMAC Gallery (Fig. 5). The title of this recent work refers to a Karanga proverb that can be loosely translated as “that which has horns cannot be wrapped,” alluding to the idea that the truth will always come out or that nature will always mete out vengeance and eventually provide a balance.Through the hybridity of form and symbolism, such as the wheelbarrow-table or the wheelbarrow-boxing bag, I explore the absurdity of definition and containment. The boxing bag is an object designed to be punched or pummeled. It's an object of appropriation and fantasy; an object of training and experimentation. Meanwhile the wheelbarrow is a symbol of raw labor, a classic example of inertia.In the work Rinamanyanga Hariputirwe, I explore the Zimbabwean sociocultural context, whilst making a broader connection to the African context.11 The work explores events of August 2016 when Zimbabwe started experiencing mass citizen protests against an oppressive government system. We witnessed a group of people questioning definitions imposed upon them and resisting a narrow mold formerly used to characterize them. In my work these developments are explored using various objects built around the boxing bag as if to defend the bags, and the horns allude to a nascent aggression built up in a group of people.Ruth Simbao: I am currently grappling with the ideas of learning sideways and reaching sideways to develop two approaches in my own work as a scholar and a teacher: 1) South-South12 and intracontinental scholarly engagement that does not always look “upwards” to the theories, methodologies, and institutions of Europe and North America13 and 2) nonhierarchical—or at least less-hierarchical—ways of learning in educational and other contexts that emphasize reciprocal, horizontal learning (Simbao 2015b). In what ways are the concepts of learning sideways or reaching sideways articulated in the visual and performing arts, and how might they be further implemented in our various contexts of scholarship, education and art production? How could a sideways reach change the orientation of the dominant discourse of the arts of Africa that in many ways continues to emphasize an “upwards” reach?Kristin NG-Yang: My work is situated in the global South and engages with South-South collaboration. It is, in part, autobiographical in that it references my own predicament as a Chinese/African artist/mother/father. My identity is tempered, as different philosophical, cultural, and gendered dimensions both challenge and shape me. Reflecting the complexity of working in this position, I recently produced an installation titled Bird/Fish14 (Fig. 6), which draws from a Chinese song in which a bird falls in love with a fish. Alluding to the ephemeral and the impossible, dancers interact with the shadows of suspended fish/birds that are painted onto plexiglass.The installation encourages viewers to meditate on issues of time and continuity, presence and absence, as well as sameness and difference. It also alludes to ambiguity: One is confronted with choice but is also subject to fate, obliged to accept or resist, in the process of learning about self and other. Through the use of live performance and music, the installation references African, Chinese, and Western cultural idioms in a collision and fusion that is both strange and yet familiar. I commissioned musician Jianjun Wang to compose a special piece for Bird/Fish, using the traditional Chinese musical instrument the guzheng and the African djembe drum. These musical instruments from different regions combine in a way that conveys a sense of otherworldliness—a sound meditation that shifts between the realms and vibrations of both birds and fish.Patrick Mudekereza (translated by Jean-Sylvain Tshilumba Mukendi): In my context in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this logic of knowledge sharing is evident in artists’ collectives in a much more relevant way than in formal arts institutions. In particular, I have experienced this in the case of the Vicanos Club in the late 1990s and early 2000s in Lubumbashi. Reflecting on our various experiences over time, it seems evident that our challenges differ when we focus locally on Lubumbashi and when we try to have a regional or international impact. In the Vicanos Club, we didn't bother much about what was happening elsewhere and we focused very locally, renaming things in a language that fluidly mixed Swahili, French, and English. Today, the practice of Waza, Centre d'art de Lubumbashi15 (Figs. 7–8) is part of the flow of information shared worldwide. This openness should not temper our enthusiasm to name our reality in our own way. Instead of using the international art world's language, we need to choose voices that reflect what we have to say, and we can then dare to expand the references used in the field. This is a big challenge, because even when interactions are broader and more fluid, the prisms and frameworks tend to remain unchanged and the same ambitious explorers are visible and present themselves to us as intermediaries. For this reason, we choose very carefully the collaborations we get involved in.Waza has integrated two networks that are worth mentioning in relation to the concept of sideways learning—Arts Collaboratory and the Africa Cluster of Another Roadmap School.16 Arts Collaboratory is a community of artistic organizations from Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The project Arts Schoolaboratory, which forms part of this network, redefines our responsibilities and develops a framework for content and methodologies based on an alternative artistic education that focuses on “learnagogy” instead of pedagogy. The Africa Cluster of Another Roadmap is a research project that sets up relevant educational tools in our own African contexts, breaking with “missionary stances” in the teaching of art that were inherited from colonization.Aidah Nalubowa: Education has different meanings for different people. In Uganda, our education continues to conform to the legacy of colonial education and as such remains a largely Western concept. If a student simply attends an institution that has a curriculum, takes exams or tests, and receives a diploma, certificate, or degree, she or he is considered to be educated. But what about a kind of education that is different—more creative and engaging? This could be, for example, something as simple as learners and the instructor sitting in a circle facing each other or the use of creative games to generate a sense of equality and active participation rather than passive agreement and conformity. Forms of sideways learning are not common in education in Uganda.As a member of the Artivists 4 Life collective in Uganda, I seek to bring creativity to scholarship and scholarship to art. Artivists 4 Life is a community of practice in Uganda that fuses artistic processes with social activism to respond to the conditions that plague our everyday modern existence, which still reflects a colonial framework. The collective was founded by a group of young artists including photographers, graphic designers, dancers, actors, painters, cartoonists, graffiti artists, and arts lovers, who have a deep desire for social change. After a series of informal meetings and brainstorming sessions that began in a small studio at Makerere University in March 2011, the group developed the name—Artivists 4 Life (from the concept of “Art + Action”)—as well as a logo (Fig. 9), a slogan, a set of core objectives, and a manifesto.The collective uses various art forms to identify problems, find solutions, and communicate particular messages. The messages are tested in the community and later presented in the form of drama skits, dances, murals, and billboards. Members of the collective, which is a registered community-based organization in Mukono District in Uganda, are based in Kampala and Kayunga Districts, as well as in Canada.17 Made up of members of varying education levels, the group embraces the approach “each one teach one,” which links to sideways learning as everyone shares knowledge and learns from one another. Group members have no permanent roles, and duties and responsibilities are distributed according to interest, availability, skills, and need at particular times.Critical to our methodology is Freire's (2005:72) notion of moving away from the “banking system” that simply “deposits” knowledge. In Freire's understanding of pedagogy, the teacher's role ceases to be that of the knower and the giver of knowledge, and the learner participates in the process of creating, analyzing, and sharing knowledge. As such, indigenous creative methods can be used to own and repurpose knowledge, creating inclusive decolonial spaces.Genevieve Hyacinthe: I was educated as an art historian and also trained as a West African ritual dancer for sixteen years, and a colleague once told me I use dance as art historical social practice. I like this descriptor; if sideways learning is about challenging hierarchies, then we art historians might consider stepping out of our comfort zones of clean, critical distance, where our words can sometimes rain (reign) down upon the artists, artworks, and contexts that we include in the discourses that we construct.One of my recent collaborative performances, entitled The West African Dance Experience (Performance and Discussion with the Students of West African Dance: History, Theory, Practice), took place in November 2016 in the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College, State University of New York, where I taught for a number of years. Here, and in many of my courses, I endeavored to collaborate with my students by breathing life into Robert Farris Thompson's (1974) now canonical text, “African Art in Motion: Icon and Act.” In this class, after reading and discussing key scholarly ideas with my students, I moved out from behind the podium and into the studio with them to share dance choreographies from djembe styles born in Senegal, Guinea, and Mali. The students were in turn encouraged to add their own contemporary moves.As I played the drums for The West African Dance Experience performance, I saw elements of the Black Lives Matter, Rhodes Must Fall, and Fees Must Fall movements being transcribed in the bodies of the student dancers, who were still recovering their breath from the recent US election failure. In the first photographic image of this series (Fig. 10), the viewer sees the back of a black male dancer who moves his hands up into the “hands up, don't shoot” position, translating through his body a catch-phrase of our era. In that photograph, however, the male student is covered, protected. His breath won't be taken, for his sisters dance in front of him, their hands fully raised, in the spirit of black preservation as women's work. In the second image (Fig. 11), two young men are protected by the Sounou dance of femininity that I taught the students of various gender expressions, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds, who come together in collective breath; in collective protest and art-making. None are alone; all of our hands are raised. The gestures of “hands up don't shoot” become the waving hands of testament, and these hands then turn into raised fists of solidarity (Fig. 12).Ruth Simbao: In recent years, critically important movements and forms of protest and activism, including Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, Rhodes Must Fall, and Fees Must Fall have challenged oppressive regimes, ongoing racism, police brutality, outmoded institutions, and increasing income disparity. In what ways have, could, or should such pressing events shape our production of scholarly and artistic knowledge? How do these movements and protests, as well as the situations of injustice that drive them, shape our writing, teaching, creative processes, and activism? How might we choose to engage with pressing social justice concerns as scholars and artists in Africa and the African diaspora without, as Basim Magdy (2003) writes, being stereotyped and limited to our respective local sociopolitical contexts and thus consumed as artists and writers in a narrow way?18Lee-Roy Jason: In October 2016 I chose to photograph the Fees Must Fall movement during a fresh spate of protests, as students in South Africa continued to demand free and decolonized tertiary education. Through my photographic work I responded to what I saw in newspapers and on television, and what I heard about the demonstrators over the radio and online. It concerned me that the “Fallists” were simply being labeled as the problem in the mainstream media and by those in power at academic institutions and in government. Regularly they were referred to as disorganized hooligans who were simply in defiance of writing exams.I wanted to be part of those who were documenting other versions of this story.I went to Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg every day for two week",

      "abstract": "In order to evaluate the impact of physical activity, especially continuous activity such as walking, cycling or running, on the lower limb joints, we overviewed approximately one hundred sources observing the subject from various directions and from different research points of view. The sources were divided into five categories: those claiming damage, those that are inconclusive, those claiming no damage, reviews, and animal experiments. Reviewing this comprehensive material revealed the evidence that high impact sports activity will damage a normal joint which has not suffered a previous injury or anatomic variation and which does not carry a genetic fault, to be borderline, though existent. In many of the cases which do suffer damage, a concealed injury has previously occurred, single or recurrent, and the injured joint would tend to present with secondary arthritic changes. The evidence that continuous non-high impact physical activity like walking, cycling or running would damage a joint with no prior anatomical damage and which does not suffer a biomechanical or genetic fault, is weak and non-persuasive, while the literature supporting no damaging effect or even improvement of the joint construction is far more persuasive and abundant. This evidence is stronger in animal experiments than in research performed with human subjects. The safest activity, it seems, is gradual and graded activity with no exploding force, not extreme and which is not irregular for the individual trainee. The advantages of the physical activity to the general health as well as to the musculo-skeletal system seem to strongly overcome their potential risks.",

Then the sequence of cultic laws is interrupted by the narrative in Leviticus 8–10, and when the lawgiving is resumed it develops a different bodily microcosm. This time the body of the worshipper is made analogous to the sanctuary and the altar: whatever will render the altar impure will do the same for the Israelite’s body. The laws of impurity sketch out the parallel in meticulous detail over Leviticus 11–15: the animal taken into the body by eating corresponds to that which is offered on the altar by fire; what is disallowed for the one is disallowed for the other; what harms the one harms the other. One thing that Leviticus never says, however, is that it is bad for the health of the body to eat any of the forbidden animals. The topic, the purity/impurity of land animals, is addressed by looking at land animals under the covenant (Leviticus 11), the similarities and differences between Leviticus and Deuteronomy as regards the definition of clean/unclean or pure/impure animals, interpretations of uncleanness/impurity, and sacred contagion.",

Many people seem to jump to the conclusion that if an entity is recognized as being intrinsically valuable then it is inviolable; that there is something more or less sacred about it such that it cannot be interfered with under any circumstances. Clearly this understanding would make any sort of life-based ethic one that recognized the intrinsic value of trees and plants as well as animals unworkable. What would those who accepted such a view eat? However, fortunately for those who accept such a view and unfortunately for those who would prefer to keep their ethics simple this understanding is quite incorrect. Even in the human case, we readily accept that it is justifiable to harm even kill another person if, for example, we are acting in self-defence. Thus, the question of whether it is wrong to harm or interfere with entities that are intrinsically valuable actually turns on the question of whether we have sufficient justification for our actions.",

      "title": "Locus of Control of High School Students of Punjab State",
      "abstract": "Locus of control refers to the extent to which individuals believe that they can control events that affect them. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an important aspect of personality studies. One's (Latin for place or location) can either be internal (meaning the person believes that they control their life) or external (meaning they believe that their environment, some higher power, or other people control their decisions and their life).Locus of control refers to a person's beliefs about control over life events. Some people feel personally responsible for the things that happen to them. Those people are labeled as internals. Individuals with a high internal locus of control believe that events result primarily from their own behavior and actions. Others feel that their outcomes in life are determined by forces beyond their control (e.g.; fate, luck and other people). These people are labeled as externals. Those with a high external locus of control believe that powerful others, fate, or chance primarily determine events.Rotter while advocating his theory of social learning has given the concept of 'Locus of Control'. The construct of locus of control is a personality dimension involving an individual's perceived control over events occurring in his life. People are having internal or external locus of control. Locus of control is the extent to which people believe that they are responsible for their behavioral outcomes. It has often been cited as an important factor in achievement oriented behaviour. Rotter terms persons who strongly believe that they can shape their own destinies are called as internals. Those who believe that their outcomes are largely the result of forces outside their control are called as externals. Internals are often happier and better adjusted than externals.People with an internal locus of control tend to believe their behaviour influences outcomes. Internal locus of control individual believes that he is guided by his/her personal decisions and efforts. On the other hand, while those with external locus of control tend to attribute outcomes to outside forces, such as fate, chance and other people. External locus of control individual believes that his/her behaviour is guided by fate, luck, or other external circumstances. These people are labeled as externals.People need to believe in their own abilities to achieve and be happy. They need to develop a sense of control. People's locus of control influences how they view the world and how they identify the causes of success or failures in their lives. Internal factors mean personal whereas external are situational ones. Obviously, most people fall between the two extremes forming a continuous distribution of locus of control beliefs. Locus of control is thought to be relatively enduring dispositional characteristics, although certainly modifiable through experience.The variable of locus of control is of major significance in understanding the nature of learning processes in different kinds of learning situations. The construct of locus of control, an integral part of social learning theory of Rotter (1954) is a personality dimension involving an individual's perceived control over events occurring in his life. This concept grew out of Rotter's Social learning theory (1954) which provides the general theoretical background for his conception of the nature and effects of reinforcement and his work on levels of expectancies.According to this theory, the unit of investigation for the study of personality is the interaction of the individual and his meaningful environment and it is the study of learned behaviour. Behaviour as described by personality theorists has a directional aspect and this aspect is inferred from the effect of reinforcing conditions. The occurrence of behaviour of a person is determined not only by the nature or importance of goals or reinforcements but also by the person's anticipation or expectancy that their goals will occur. …",

This process begins with the individual’s increasing deep awareness of self-knowledge. The process of self-knowledge enables the individual to explore his inner world and understand emotional states. “Being me” requires being spiritually strong. Spiritually strong people manage their emotions, thoughts and behaviors in a way that provides them success in life. Determining priorities means understanding what the individual values in life and acting accordingly. Likewise, knowing responsibilities and boundaries allows for a healthy balance in social relationships and maintaining the necessary space for personal growth. Recognizing wounds means recognizing past traumas and taking steps towards the healing process. It refers to the individual’s selfishness of prioritizing his own needs in the process of \"being me\" as \"not being able to break away from me\". On the contrary, it refers to situations such as being unable to protect one’s own freedom and personal identity and creating one’s own happiness through the happiness and preferences of one’s partner, as \"getting lost in you\". In this context, the process of \"Being Me\" is an important journey for the individual to discover himself and become spiritually stronger and mature. When spouses who have completed this process come together, a family that is happy, healthy and knows what it wants is formed.",

      "title": "Ghosts—in Theory—in Theater",
      "abstract": "Ghosts—in Theory—in Theater Kevin Riordan (bio) For a moment, near the turn to the twenty-first century, theory seemed to die. In addition to the proclamations of pundits, even those most invested in its projects—broadly defined—adopted a more critical and reflective attitude towards theory’s already critical and reflective questions.1 The death of theory—like the death of God or the author—is of course never quite a death, yet the phrase does tellingly articulate a prevalent critical posture of mourning or nostalgia. Theory of course persists and returns, in its life or its afterlives, and the so-called death is just one trajectory of thought in a heterogeneous terrain. And this recent death-inflected stance also rhymes with older, familiar positions such as Paul de Man’s in “The Resistance to Theory” in which theory’s obstacles actually re-energize the activity they propose to interrupt. Somewhat appropriately, after theory’s only seeming death, ghosts (as objects or actors) and haunting (as a system of relations) have gained a curious currency in and beyond a strictly theoretical discourse. To begin the 2013 Spectralities Reader, María del Pilar Blanco and Esther Peeren argue that ghosts have become “conceptual metaphors permeating global (popular) culture and academia alike” (1). But with their proliferation and diffusion, ghosts have lost their functional coherence and agency as ghosts; Blanco and Peeren passingly acknowledge the possibility of haunting becoming “over-stretched” (15). In this essay I heed and extend their warning to show how haunting indeed has been overstretched with ghosts becoming part of a troublingly imprecise vocabulary that serves to disembody and disengage theory. I then proceed to propose that theater studies—conspicuously absent from the Blanco and Peeren collection and the critical conversation more broadly—provides a productive framework to recover and to better understand the ghost’s powerful and crucially unstable position in contemporary thought. A language of ghosts, specters, and apparitions—and the variations are telling—has come to summarize and symptomatize the big questions that high theory seeks to address.2 Theater critic Alice Rayner describes some of these stakes: “Ghosts animate our connections to the dead, producing a visible, material, and affective relationship to the abstract terms of time and repetition, sameness and difference, absence and presence” (xiii). Rayner names but a few of the aporetic pairings that haunting has been invoked to describe, animate, or mediate. Elsewhere, ghosts have been summoned to speak to any number of other topics of theoretical concern: speech and writing, fact and fiction, mind and body, archive and repertoire. But with critics deploying ghosts as heuristic for such a wide set of objects and inquiries, ghosts quite simply have ceased to be ghosts. Standing in for other questions, ghosts begin to lose both their identity and [End Page 165] their difference, their uncertain substance and their certain agency. Subsumed into a semiotic economy, the ghost becomes a sign without a referent, and haunting a metaphysical exercise rather than a transformative encounter between the living and the dead. With special guidance from how the ghost has been thought in theater—and particularly in Hamlet—this essay follows the ghost through the death of theory, as the death of theory, and instead of the death of theory. My interest is in maintaining the ghost’s alterity, its resistance, and its agency, as a figure of life-and-death that resists and renews thought.3 The ghost’s stubborn obscurity and its resistance to reading make us read ourselves—and our position in reading—differently. If and when a ghost appears on stage, in and among the materials of the world, it tests credibility and it induces doubt and wonder, and that does something—or at least it seems to. Theater and theory, through what follows, share a persistent curiosity about and a commitment to what seems. I begin by acknowledging the ghost’s role as a figure—“It is perhaps the hidden figure of all figures”—in philosophical thought and I then describe its recent, disengaged invocations (Derrida, Specters of Marx 150). Along this trajectory, a note in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno’s 1944 The Dialectic of Enlightenment provides...",

Trance trusted by the community as a condition that occurs when the spirit others enter one's and master it so that it becomes another in terms of speech, behavior and nature. His behavior became like there Another personality who 'enter'. Maramis (1994:418) call a dissociative mechanism which can lead to multiple personalities (multiple personality) and dissociative identity disorder (dissociative identity disorder). Kaplan & Sadock (1997:100) states that the major dysfunction in the dissociative is the loss of integrity of states of consciousness so that people feel no have experienced the confusion of identity or identity of its own or have multiple identities. Society considers that it happened because someone possessed has conceded the genie or spirit that makes strange behavior outside consciousness. And treatment according to the general public with a request help to the smart people, paranormal, religious scholars, and people which is considered an expert handle it. Rarely do patients with dissociative taken to the doctor. Trance in psychology known as dissociative phenomena which is defined as a psychological state that occurs due to a change in the functioning of self (identity, memory or consciousness) (Nevid, Rathus & Greene, 1997:236). This condition can occur suddenly or gradually, are temporary or chronic. This dissociation phenomenon refers to the trance dissociative. Dissociative trance is a temporary change in terms of consciousness or a weak / loss of feeling self-identity (sense of personal identity) without the emergence of new identities (Suryaningrum, 2006). Under conditions trance, loss of identity is not related to the emergence of new identities and actions raised during a trance state is generally not complex (Eg kejangkejang, bergulingguling, fall). According Hawari (2006), trance is a reaction that kejiwaaan called dissociation reaction (dissociative reactions). The reaction led to loss of ability to recognize the reality around him, due to pressure physically and mentally. This dissociation reaction upon them that his soul labile plus the condition that made him depressed. Stress that piled added a trigger enabling the controlled reaction of this subconscious 3 come to the surface, so that someone who is experiencing severe stress, then it very easy to experience dissociative trance. Here's one example the case of dissociative trance state as it has experienced by subjects in this study. The subjects had experienced a trance\r\nwhen aged 20 years. When the incident was the subject felt in him something control, he berteriakteriak and weeping and occurred nearly five hours ever, he did not realize that he is in a state of trance. The subject admitted before experiencing a trance, the subject has a variety of problems heavy. At that time many of the problems it faces, ranging from problems Personally, the problem with the family until the economic problems that can not be resolved. And finally permasalahanpermasalahan makes depressed subjects. The international medical world, especially psychiatry recognize the phenomenon and written in guiding the most recent psychiatric diagnosis Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder IV (DSMIV) and The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 (ICD10). DSMIV enter possessed pathologic (pathologic possession) into a dissociative disorder diagnosis is not specific (dissociative disorder Otherwise not specified). ICD10 categorizes as disorders possessed trance and possession disorder (DSMIVTR, 2000). In fact in daily life, many people who experience dissociative trance without realizing it. In other words he refused to say trance for example, when they're driving, aircraft, and was watching TV in a state of daydreaming. Trance, case found in many third world countries. In India the culture and similar culture of Indonesia, possesion syndrome or hysterical possesion is a form of dissociation of the most frequently found. Figures happened approximately 1 4% from the general population. Epidemiological studies have possesion reportedly related to the social crisis in the community (Hidayat, 2006). Based on gender, women have a greater risk dissociative trance than boys. The condition usually occurs trans in women and is often associated with stress or trauma (Barlow & Durand, 2002:177). This is evident from the cases which occurs mostly are women. This may be because women are more sugestible or more easily influenced than boys.\r\nThose who have personality histerikal sugestible which one character is more risky for the dissociation or also become victims of crime hypnotist. Based on the age, most victims dissociation-old adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it can be concluded that those at risk for dissociation were female teens or young adults are easily influenced. Barlow & Durand (2002:174) states, when individuals felt detached from him or as if he was like a dream, it can be said he dissociative experience. Dissociation most likely occurs after kejadiankejadian which makes the individual very stressful. It may also occur when someone is weakened or psychic experience mental distress. Many species study expresses a relationship between traumatic events, particularly physical and sexual abuse during children, with dissociative (Kaplan, 1997:100). Dissociative trance state is a phenomenon that is admirable and interesting but confusing. Based on existing explanations, dissociative trance phenomenon is still unknown for certain reasons, so researchers are keen to raise this phenomenon as a scientific research. This study represents an initial step to know the factors the causes (etiology), a person may experience trance dissociative.",

Direct physical fit and matching is jigsaw fit matching and is applicable to solid materials that break into pieces in a random way. Indirect physical matching is fitting, or attempting to fit, severed, broken, or torn pieces of an item or object together in a way that convincingly demonstrates that the pieces were once part of the same structure.

This, in and of itself, is not a particularly radical notion - the gender, sexuality, religion, etc, of the researcher having been problematised in a variety of critical discourses for at least several decades - but what is proposed here, rather, is an analysis of a somewhat more fundamental nature; one that explores the concept of the researcher as a ‘Being’ and, at least initially, strips away such cultural inflections of the researcher’s ‘self’ to concentrate upon what it means to be an inquiring Being. Only once the researcher’s experience of being a ‘Being’ in the world has been examined, and ‘this must be done explicitly, even at the risk of discussing the ‘obvious’’ (Heidegger, Being and Time 1997: 81), can an attempt be made to qualify its impact on their reaction to the physical world and the artefacts and beings therein. \r\n\r\nThis paper builds upon current discourses that endeavour to reintroduce the ‘agency’ of studied individuals into the anthropological and archaeological records, but argues that before the agency of others manifested by their material and cultural practices can be understood, the researcher must necessarily understand their own being and subsequent relationship with others and external ‘things’.",

      "title": "Ethics, politics, and criminality: Plato's cosmological perspective",
      "abstract": "In the Laws Plato argues that no one who believes in the gods would voluntarily commit a crime. Plato's view on the nature of the gods is radically different from the traditional Greek view which portrays the gods as human beings writ large. He advanced the opinion that the gods are not jealous, vindictive, greedy, and corruptible, but rather morally virtuous, incorruptible, and happy. This is reflected in Plato's law on impiety in Laws 10, which contends that any lawless, impious, or criminal act is due to one of three possible misunderstandings about the gods : 1. that the gods do not exist; 2. that the gods exist, but do not care for us; 3. that the gods are corruptible. While Plato is of the opinion that the third heresy is the worse of all, since the gods are (or must be) the models of virtue and happiness for the political community, he must first demonstrate that the gods exist and then that they care for us. The atheism that Plato confronts was a consequence of natural philosophy or more precisely, of the way it developed following the birth of philosophy. While the notion of divinity was inherent in the concept of phusis (nature) from the very first Greek cosmologies, the fact remains that for the phusiologoi the order that makes our world a cosmos is natural, that is, immanent in nature, and thus explicable without recourse to an intentional cause. In the Laws, Plato asserts that atheism is a disease that recurs periodically and that afflicts a certain number of minds. The cause of atheism is not, according to Plato, the inability to master pleasures and desires but rather the phusiologoi and their writings, which contend that the law and morality guaranteed by the gods do not exist by nature but derive from convention. An influential part of the intelligentsia seized upon these theories and concluded in word and deed that one's egoistic passions should not be restricted and that the behaviour of the gods of traditional religion did indeed constitute models to follow. In this article, an attempt is made to show how Plato's ethics, politics, and cure for crime in the Laws are grounded in his counter-cosmological perspective, which he feels is based on arguments that will be acceptable to all.",

      "title": "Poltergeists - a Phenomenon Worthy of Serious Study",
      "abstract": "FOLKLORISTS FOCUS ON STORIES, tales, legends, proverbs, riddles, and jokes -- all genres that contain artistic elements and lend themselves easily to analysis and comparative studies. In the area of folk belief, studies in the past have concentrated mainly on such genres as ghost stories or superstitions, both of which feature verbal art and the expressive use of language. However, we neglect hundreds of other folk beliefs not nearly as entertaining or as easy to study. Often these beliefs pose a special problem for folklorists, since people may seldom express them, or the activities related to the beliefs may rarely occur. One of the more interesting of these obscure folk/popular traditions in Europe, England, and America (and probably elsewhere as well) is the phenomenon. term derives from the German (polter meaning noise or racket, and geist meaning spirit), and traditionally referred to specific types of activity that have no demonstrable cause but were believed to be the activity of pesky little spirits: objects flying through the air and perhaps striking someone, furniture or walls moving or shaking, or the production of rapping noises or sounds that imitate the human voice. For most of us, this and other unexplainable phenomena seem too bizarre and far-fetched to warrant further study. folklorist, however, recognizes in the poltergeist phenomenon something that contains surprisingly more than meets the eye. Poltergeist outbreaks occur rarely, and last only a very short time, perhaps only days, thus making difficult serious investigation or scientific analysis; by the time the reports reach folklorists or other researchers, the attacks have stopped as mysteriously as they started. Observers notice that the activities center around a particular person -- usually, but not always, an adolescent female -- only during that person's waking hours. One of the most famous cases of poltergeistery in the United States occurred in Hydeville, New York about 1848 in the home of John D. Fox. His three daughters noticed a recurrence of mysterious rappings suggesting a code of communication -- one rap for no, two raps for doubtful, and three raps for yes, with a more complicated code for longer messages. Fox sisters eventually became mediums in the Spiritualist movement, whose followers believed the rappings to be messages from the dead. Sometime later one of the sisters apparently admitted that the spirit knocks were produced fraudulently, thus giving weight to the theory that poltergeist cases always involve trickery. (Perhaps the Fox sisters did indeed have poltergeist experiences in the beginning, but were never able to reproduce them and thus resorted to fraud.) Before the advancements of information technology, sporadic reports of poltergeistery appeared in the United States, Britain, and Europe. More recently, about once or twice annually, we have reports of activity that we recognize as poltergeistery, even though that word may never be used. Merely because a newspaper or television program publicizes a mysterious event does not mean, of course, that the phenomenon is genuine or that no fraud is involved. However, because reports of poltergeistery come very often from sensible, disinterested witnesses and bear striking similarities, we may conclude that either the events really happened or that the observers are somehow influenced to believe that similar activities occurred. In any case, this phenomenon deserves very careful consideration by scholars from various disciplines. We tend to discount reports of anything unconventional or strange from centuries past, as if almost everyone who lived before the mid-20th century had superstitious beliefs and therefore could not possibly be objective. Some accounts, however, appear to be so rational that we take notice. For example, the Reverend Glanvill, a 17th century philosopher and scholar, described in a very sensible and straightforward manner what came to be known as The Drummer of Tidworth, a classic poltergeist case. …",

      "abstract": "This paper is the culmination of my independent research into the phenomenon of \"body hacking\": DIY techno-body modification that typically involves the surgical embedding of electronic or computing devices into the body. Body hackers are operating largely within a transhumanist vision (body hacing to improve and/or transcend the self or the human condition) and outside of traditional medical institutions. My paper addresses conceptions of the hacked body, including the deliberate and physical transition into \"cybrog\" and the blurred line of \"humanness\" that comes from a surgical merge with technology. I focus on the perspectives on corporeality that come from body hackers themselves; I find that there are varying opinions within the body hacking community on the value of the material body. Many body hackers aim to transcend or render obsolete the physical body - in search of a more enlightened or convenient existence, for example - but others see body hacking as a practice that makes them more human. Many body hackers see the physical human condition as a very limited one that is in need of improvement. My paper explores these perspectives and presents a nuanced picture of the modern body hacking philosophy, as a fascinating example of the interface between materiality/coroporeality and technology.",

The word victim is derived from the Latin word, “victim” and the verb vincere, vaincere and has the meaning of sacrifice, suffering, damage, victimization, destruction of property, while the science which deals with its study is called victimology. The word victim essentially means the person or group that has suffered, that has been harmed as a result of various actions whether caused by man, animals, natural disasters, etc. In general, we are talking about human, animal and plant victims, and with an expression characterized the whole process of human suffering, which is called, “victimization”, which means an indefinite number of wrongdoings that endanger, annihilate, damage and threaten the basic goods and values of man. In fact, when the term victimization is used, it is thought about the ways, routes, forms of injury, its scale and intensity (Halili, 2011). Victims according to the legislation, respectively the positive provisions of Republic of North Macedonia, but also according to various legalities in the world, enjoy many rights, among which the victims have the right to compensation for damage. Damage compensation can be calculated in moral and material compensation. The moral compensation is not foreseen with positive provisions; however, it is presented as a satisfaction of the sentence which is imposed on the perpetrator or perpetrators, while the material compensation is defined with positive legal provisions. We can conclude that moral compensation is presented in cases when the victim feels in himself that the goal has been achieved and the perpetrator has been given the deserved punishment, while material compensation is realized in a certain legal procedure and the perpetrator or the state in certain cases performs compensation.",

      "title": "Behavior and behavioral needs",
      "abstract": "An understanding of behavior is important in any consideration of poultry welfare. Behavior is a good indicator of states of suffering such as fear, frustration, and pain. It might also be possible to use social interactions as indicators of welfare. The possibility of using \"luxury\" behavior, such as play and exploratory behavior, as an indicator of positive emotional states, requires investigation. Important welfare consequences arise from the fact that some behavior may be so strongly motivated as to constitute a \"need\". A behavioral need will arise in the case of behavior, such as nesting, that is controlled largely by internal factors, because these factors will be present no matter what type of environment is provided. Behavior triggered largely by external stimuli, such as responses to predators, will not give rise to a need if the external factors can be removed from the environment. Dustbathing is an example of behavior controlled by complex interactions between internal and external factors; the extent to which this constitutes a need is still being debated. If a behavioral need arises, then it is important that the environment provided allows it to be performed without damage to the performer or other birds. It should also be remembered that birds may need to perform behavior, including appetitive as well as consummatory elements, although the functional consequences of these are no longer required for survival. Finally, the performance of certain behavior leads to an increase in health or physical condition that improves welfare later in life.",

The following contribution intends to join this trend by offering some reflections on the “animal rights” debate, which is to be situated within the wider context of environmental philosophy. While classical Western concepts of man were anthropocentric, recent cultural developments have triggered a rediscovery of Nature, especially of nonhuman animals, while focusing on their affiliations with us, humans. Appropriate relations with those animals require a respectful attitude on the human side, as if those animals had full moral and legal rights. But is this not an illusion? Can we talk about real “rights” for animals, or should we just remain aware of them having their own feelings and take care not to hurt them, unless for a “serious” cause?

Many times, the right action (putting the milk away) is performed on the wrong object (the cereal box). In health care, a similar example would be a nurse hanging a bag of heparin when intending to hang a bag of norepinephrine. Health care slips may have more significant consequences than spoiled milk.When slips happen, does it mean that we are not intelligent, competent, or responsible? Not at all, according to Norman. He states, “Humans err continually; it is an intrinsic part of our nature.”1(p66) People are not machines; slips are a part of normal human behavior. In fact, slips tend to happen more often to experts than to novices. With experience, the subconscious may perform routine tasks automatically, whereas a novice needs to pay significant attention because each task is new.A part of the solution is to design systems that will prevent, catch, or fix natural human slips to avoid error. Recognizing that it is easy for a nurse to pick up the wrong medication when infusion bags look like each other, many institutions have implemented a system of barcode scanning to catch slips. Another ingenious example of a system safeguard is an enteral feeding connector (ENFit, GEDSA) that creates a physical barrier to intravenous administration of enteral formulas. A low-technology example of safer system design could be an interruption-free zone for medication preparation. Let us use the power of system thinking to make health care safer for all.The nurse must first seek to understand the patient’s values and perspective because trust and empathy are fundamental components of delivering ethical care. Inviting the patient to discuss their decision to forgo surgery (C) will provide the nurse and the patient the opportunity to explore the patient’s understanding of their disease process, the risks and benefits of surgery, and their goals of care without violating the patient’s right to autonomy. The discussion will also afford the nurse the opportunity to identify and clarify any misconceptions the patient might have. An ethics consultation (A) is warranted when ethical principles are violated, which does not appear to be the case for this patient because the patient retains the right to autonomous decision-making. The patient may already be aware of the risk of death and disability from an embolic stroke (B), so it is important for the nurse to ascertain the patient’s understanding first. Encouraging family members to talk the patient into having surgery (D) will not facilitate trust and an understanding of the patient’s perspective and may be interpreted by the patient as coercive.Up to 57% of patients placed in the prone position develop a pressure injury, primarily to the face. Placing silicone foam dressings on facial pressure points before placing the patient in the prone position helps to reduce the risk for facial pressure injuries. Commercial endotracheal securement devices (A) have plastic components that can result in facial pressure injuries. Tape is an acceptable alternative to secure the endotracheal tube during prone positioning. Discontinuing enteral nutrition (C) can result in malnutrition; enteral nutrition can be continued while the patient is in the prone position. Removing ECG leads during the proning maneuver (D) will not permit the nurse to detect dysrhythmias that may occur during repositioning. Instead, ECG leads should be placed on the patient’s upper back and flank areas.The patient is exhibiting signs of acute kidney injury. Losartan (B), an angiotensin receptor blocking agent, is nephrotoxic and should be stopped in a patient with acute kidney injury. Although the patient has developed acute kidney injury, none of the indications for continuous renal replacement therapy (A), which include severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and uremia, are present. Studies have demonstrated worsening acute kidney injury with the use of hydroxyethyl starch solutions (C). Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (D) will help lower the patient’s serum potassium level and should not be discontinued.The use and duration of an indwelling urinary catheter should be minimized to avoid a CAUTI. Therefore, the best way to protect the patient from a CAUTI is to remove the indwelling urinary catheter (D) as soon as it is no longer needed for a clinical reason. Routine hygiene care is important, but cleaning the periurethral area with an antiseptic (A) is not recommended to prevent a CAUTI. Routine irrigation of a urinary catheter (B) is not recommended unless obstruction from bleeding after prostatic or bladder surgery is present. Changing urinary catheters (C) at routine, fixed intervals is not recommended and should be considered only for indications such as infection, obstruction, or a compromised closed system.An acute spinal cord injury above the level of T6 can result in neurogenic shock and bradycardia due to blockage of signals to sympathetic ganglia located adjacent to the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. Evidence-based recommendations suggest maintaining the patient’s mean arterial pressure in the range of 85 to 90 mm Hg for 5 to 7 days to enhance spinal cord perfusion. Norepinephrine (A) can be used for patients with a cervical or high thoracic spinal cord injury to increase blood pressure and mitigate the risk for bradycardia due to unopposed vagal tone. Although an injection of atropine (B) may raise the patient’s heart rate, it will not sustain a rise in blood pressure for 7 days. A nicardipine infusion (C) will lower blood pressure, thus threatening spinal cord perfusion. Glycopyrrolate (D) is typically used during surgery to counteract drug-induced or vagal reflexes with bradycardia.Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis include elevated lipase and amylase levels and hypocalcemia. Elevated serum aspartate transaminase level and hypophosphatemia (C) are findings consistent with acute liver failure. The laboratory results in choices A and D reflect normal values.For moderate procedural sedation, evidence-based guidelines recommend that a person other than the practitioner performing the procedure be present to continuously monitor the patient for oversedation and hemodynamic changes. The nurse’s best action in this situation is to stay with the patient (A) because the person performing the procedure may focus more on the procedure than the patient’s sedation level, and audible cues may not be present to indicate early signs of oversedation (B). If necessary, the physician may choose to briefly interrupt the procedure (D), but having a colleague deliver the needed supplies is a better option so that the sterile field will be maintained.Decreased blood pressure is an expected result of a nitroglycerin infusion, but hypotension often limits the level to which a nitroglycerin dose can be increased. A decrease in blood pressure to a defined parameter is a reason to stop increasing the dose. Relief of chest pain provides evidence that a nitroglycerin infusion is successfully optimizing coronary perfusion, so increased chest pain (B) is an indication for continuing to increase the dose of the infusion. Transient ST-segment depression (C) may occur with unstable angina and would be an indication for continuing to increase the dose of the nitroglycerin infusion if chest pain is also present. New pulmonary crackles (D) may be a sign of left heart failure, and continuing the nitroglycerin infusion to promote preload reduction would be beneficial in decreasing the workload on the heart.In patients with hypernatremia, the increased concentration of intravascular sodium tends to promote water movement out of the cells, causing intracellular dehydration and a free water deficit. Hypotonic intravenous fluids such as 0.45% saline are indicated for treatment because they provide free water that distributes into the intracellular space for rehydration. Some patients with hypernatremia also have hypovolemia, and these patients may receive an isotonic fluid (A, B). However, all patients with hypernatremia have a free water deficit, which would not be treated by an isotonic fluid. In fact, 0.9% normal saline (A) is a slightly hypertonic solution, making 0.45% saline a better choice for patients with hypernatremia. Colloid solutions (D) create high intravascular oncotic pressure to draw fluid from the cells and interstitial space into the vascular space. This effect would likely worsen intracellular dehydration in a patient with hypernatremia.This patient is experiencing hypoxemia and hypoventilation and needs both oxygen therapy and ventilatory support. The presence of respiratory acidosis in the arterial blood gas result indicates hypoventilation and abnormal gas exchange. Hypoventilation can be a cause of hypoxemia, and bilevel positive airway pressure will provide oxygen along with positive pressure to open alveoli and improve carbon dioxide elimination. Respiratory support devices that provide oxygen but do not assist in increasing ventilation (A, B, C) will not resolve this patient’s respiratory acidosis.AACN Certcorp publishes a study bibliography that identifies the sources from which items are validated.

For God to be over against the creature as an other who might threaten its autonomy in this way would imply a gap between God’s will and creaturely substance that is inconsistent with creation ex nihilo , according to which creatures are other than God, but God, as the exclusive ground of creaturely existence, is ‘Not other’ than they. This point disrupts the relationships of privation or dependence that mark inner‐worldly acts of creating. To be (always only partly) dependent on a created other is indeed to be revealed as less than sufficient unto oneself; but to be (wholly) dependent on the ‘Not other’ is to be fully sufficient to fulfil the promise of one’s existence.",

      "title": "Discussion: The Values of Life",
      "abstract": "In Life's Dominion, Dworkin aims at defusing the controversy about abortion and euthanasia by redefining its terms. Basically, it is not a dispute about the right to life, but about its value. Liberals should grant that human life has not only a personal, but also an intrinsic value; conservatives should accept the principle of toleration, which requires to let people decide for themselves about matters of intrinsic value. Dworkin fails, however, to distinguish between two kinds of personal value: (1) the value of something to a person, when he actually or dispositionally desires it, or finds it pleasant; and (2) the value of something to a person, when it 'objectively' contributes to his well-being, as defined by reference to his personal point of view, whether or not he ever perceives it as so contributing. He also fails to distinguish between two meanings of the concept of 'intrinsic value': (3) ultimate, i.e., non-instrumental personal value of kind (2); (4) the impersonal value of something which is not good-for-anybody, but simply good, i.e., not a constituent of someone's well-being. Dworkin argues that the human fetus from conception onwards has a value, that it is not a personal value of kind (1), and, therefore, must be an intrinsic value. But the value of the life of the fetus is not a personal value of kind (2) either and, therefore, not an intrinsic value of kind (3): it is normally a constituent of the well-being of the pregnant woman, but that doesn't constitute its value, and it is not good 'for' the fetus itself in the relevant sense, because it doesn't have a personal point of view. If, however, the fetus' life is allowed to have an intrinsic value of kind (4), the conservative cannot be refuted by appeal to the principle of toleration, for this only concerns intrinsic value of kind (3). The liberal, indeed, should recognize that the fetus' life has a value, but it is neither a personal value (1) or (2), nor an impersonal value (4), but rather a relational value which gradually develops from some point substantially later than conception.",

      "abstract": "Is it possible to donate unpaired vital organs, foreseeing but not intending one's own death? We argue that this is indeed psychologically possible, and thus far agree with Charles Camosy and Joseph Vukov in their recent paper on “double effect donation.” Where we disagree with these authors is that we see double-effect donation not as a morally praiseworthy act akin to martyrdom but as a morally impermissible act that necessarily disrespects human bodily integrity. Respect for bodily integrity goes beyond avoiding the aim to kill: not all side effects of deliberate bodily interventions can be outweighed by intended benefits for another even if the subject fully consents. It is not any necessary intention to kill or harm another or oneself that makes lethal donation/harvesting illicit but the more immediate intention to accept or perform surgery on an (innocent) person combined with the foresight of lethal harm and no health-related good for him or her. Double-effect donation falls foul of the first condition of double-effect reasoning in that the immediate act is wrong in itself. We argue further that the wider effects of such donation would be socially disastrous and corrupting of the medical profession: doctors should retain a sense of nonnegotiable respect for bodily integrity even when they intervene on willing subjects for the benefit of others. Summary: Lethal organ donation (for example, donating one's heart) is not a praiseworthy but a morally impermissible act. This is not because such donation necessarily involves any aim to kill oneself (if one is the donor) or to kill the donor (if one is the surgeon). Respect for bodily integrity goes beyond avoiding any hypothetical aim to kill or harm oneself or another innocent person. ‘Double effect donation’ of unpaired vital organs, defended by Camosy and Vukov, is in our view a form of lethal bodily abuse and would also harm the transplant team, the medical profession and society at large.",

However, the failure of the dam upstream to break (thus inundating the house with water) was not. Similarly, failures to prevent harms are sometimes, but not always, morally wrong. For instance, failing to save a nearby drowning child is morally wrong. Yet, you are also in some sense 'allowing' someone on another continent to drown right now, and this seems permissible. Here, I argue that these two issues are connected. Roughly, I argue that it is prima facie morally wrong to fail to prevent a particular harm if and only if one's omission is causally relevant to that harm's occurrence. The result is that, contrary to what Peter Singer claims, failing to donate to famine relief is not morally equivalent to failing to rescue a drowning child in a shallow pond.",

      "title": "Personal Integrity within Society",
      "abstract": "In the most general sense, integrity is a concept that can only be understood in relation to another. The Latin \"integritas\", from which the word “integrity” is derived, refers to the indefinite and irreproachable, untouched condition of an object. Initially, it was used to describe the indeterminate power of the body, but also the chastity or purity of a person, in opposition to an unclean character. Of course, the term can be used with respect to anyone or anything, who/that can have integrity, as long as they/it are intact or untouched. Anyone or anything who has retained their natural characteristics can be regarded as integral. Anyone who is morally weaker in comparison with previous state has lost his integrity. Thus, if we consider this explanation, it can be observed, on closer examination, that this meaning of integrity has a very strong normative connotation because it implies an ideal, a standard from which any rambling is not only a transgression, but an aberration that leads in a worse state. However, there is no measurement system for any object or person that clearly indicates loss of integrity. Not every change means a loss and not every violation represents a loss of integrity. Some changes do not endanger physical or spiritual integrity, because, if they were, no form of life would be integral, because life involves changes and, often, these changes can be seen as real disturbances, but normal from an evolutionary point of view.",

      "abstract": "It is a given that nature from the beginning of time has been represented as female and thus open to exploitation of various kinds. The emergence of the field of “animal geography,” which “follow[s] how animals have been socially defined, used as food, labeled as pets or pests, as useful or not, classed as sentient, as fish, as insect, or as irrational ‘others’ which are evidently not human, by differing periods and worldly contexts,” has begun a much needed analysis of animals “in their local material spaces,” even when those locations may be “imaginary, literary, psychological and even virtual” (Philo and Wilbert 5). The phenomenon I am investigating here is that of male writers/explorers/sailors/hunters who, in a variety of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century documents, deal with a feminized or subaltern nature whose nonhuman creatures can be subjected to perversities ranging from the amorous to the culinary and resulting in torture and extermination. The evidence I will be examining is literary and documentary, as well as sociological and psychological. The places described or documented, moreover, become inhabited transiently by humans engaged in conquest, whether military, commercial, or socio-psychological, and the animals belonging to these territories are hunted and/or punished in modes that replicate men's rule over women or subaltern males.",

      "abstract": "The use of freedom-depriving measures (physical and medicinal restraints) in people with cognitive impairment or dementia in clinical care settings is of ongoing importance. At the same time, these coercive measures are not only heavily debated but also in most cases ethically questionable from the perspective of the ethics of human dignity. Usually, the ethical evaluation of freedom-depriving measures follows classical paradigms of medical ethics, such as the Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress. To enrich the debate at this point, the ethical category of embodiment (Leiblichkeit ) is introduced and discussed after a short summary of the ethical problem at hand. The phenomenon of the living body that has received increasingly more attention in several sciences since the proclaimed corporeal turn enables new perspectives towards human dignity, freedom and deprivation of freedom: freedom-depriving measures do not take place in an invisible realm of ideas but are directly applied to the psychophysical unity that is the living body of a person. Thus, freedom-depriving measures are an intervention into the bodily autonomy of the human being and the personal freedom that is manifested in the living body. The concept of the living body (Leib) that is applied here, signifies more than just a physical object and is especially apt to capture the (inter)subjective dimension that has to be taken into account here. Finally, it will have to be investigated whether the use of medicinal restraints represents an especially serious interference into the sphere of human embodiment. Once introduced into the debate on freedom-depriving measures in clinical care, the category of embodiment can warrant decisive new emphases.",

Yin/yang describe the polar eects or impacts of phenomena. When viewing any one phenomenon (or comparing two phenomena), yin/yang describe the opposing qualities inherent in it; for example, winter and summer would be the yin/yang, respectively, of the year. Yin• /yang are mutually rooted. Yin/yang are not adversarial, but are complementary qualities in a gestalt. at is to say, the yin aspect and the yang aspect of any one phenomenon will, when put together,form the entire phenomenon, with the combination being more than each component part. Yin/yang is a philosophy of duality. is is the reason why the Chinese term has no \"and\" between yin/yang-the term always expresses the two parts making up the one. In the example above, winter plus summer makes up the whole year. Yin• /yang mutually transform each other-e maximum eect of one quality will be followed by the transition toward the opposing quality. In other words, once the maximum yang aspect has manifest, such as the long days of summer, this will be followed by the transition toward the yin aspect, with the shortening of the days as winter approaches. Yin• /yang mutually wax and wane-e yin/yang aspects are in dynamic equilibrium. As one aspect declines, the other increases to an equal degree. For example, in the cycle of the year, the long days of summer gradually shorten and the nights gradually lengthen as winter approaches. roughout the process, however, the length of each day is a constant 24 hours (the equilibrium), and it is only the relative length of light and darkness that changes (the dynamic).",

      "title": "The Leader-Follower Connection",
      "abstract": "(Figure 1) The \"absence of leadership\"' has become a convenient excuse for all of the shortcomings of the nursing profession.Leadership is about power. And it may be that we have misread the nature of power, thereby misjudging roles and relationships and compromising our ability to take charge of our own future. Power has to be understood as the product of social relationships. Power is given or it does not exist. Sometimes it is given freely, sometimes coercively; often it is withheld as a demonstration of defiance. Power may be awarded by a system, it may be a personal attribute, or it may be shared by those who possess it with those they wish to empower. The underlying principles of power and its connection to leadership are abstract, but the proofs are within the personal experiences of each of us. We have known the manager who finds it difficult or impossible to move an agenda despite being in a position of authority with access to resources, or the bully who is far more successful in controlling the behavior of others than reality warrants. Each scenario depicts leadership, if only by its absence or in a negative form. The outcome is largely dependent on the choices of the followers. And then there are the leaders who motivate you to walk that extra painful mile, who wear their power comfortably but purposefully and convince you that there is an end beyond the means. The attributes of successful leaders have been well documented. As a class they are natural role models who convey the expectation that subordinates will emulate their values. Those values include a large dose of humanism and respect for people. People skills are their forte. They are very much part of the team, yet possess vision that sets them apart. That vision is shared openly and honestly, but in a restrained fashion so as not to overwhelm those that follow. The net result is security among followers based on the fact that someone is out front leading the way through uncharted territory. To accomplish the goals they share with their followers, these leaders surround themselves with the best and the brightest people for the challenge at hand and allow them to proceed, resisting any temptation to micromanage. They comfortably straddle the line between internal and external environments, acting, looking and speaking the part of leader, eclectically educated and polished. A sometimes inordinate faith is placed in the support of one's followers, and consequently they are comfortable taking risks. In fact, anything that does not entail risk in the acquisition is probably not worth having as far as they are concerned. Such are the characteristics of effective leaders, which may come to them naturally or through the cultivation of followers. With a leadership vacuum, there is little vision, even less risk-taking, and a parochialism that reduces work to drudgery. Communication becomes incomplete and guarded. Deception and insecurity begin to dominate and paralyze. Followers are restrained in their commitment, feeling an absence of direction. There is an uneasy sense among followers that they are being held to a higher standard than their supposed leaders. Today's challenge is to achieve practical application of these observations about leading and following and their relationship to power. Honesty also moves us to question whether a leadership vacuum is any more costly than a deficit of followers. Each role requires talent and strength. One is neither more nor less than the other, but simply aligned with different talents, personalities, and lifestyles. While the prescription for leadership seems clear, the qualities of an effective follower are less well defined. Are we comfortable with open and complete communication? Are we ready to buy into a vision when some pieces are imperfectly defined? Are we willing to assume ownership of our ideas, and to tear down the fences that are conveniently erected to maintain the distance between our professional and private lives? How much personal sacrifice will we endure and how much support and protection will we assure leaders when the going gets tough for them on our behalf? Those are neither leaders nor followers who find themselves marking time in place and going nowhere. Those who show the qualities of leadership should be empowered, and it is by this deliberate and conscious action that a cohort of followers is created.",

How do we know that the excellences recognized in our practices and form of life – even if they should contribute to our flourishing in ways described in Chapter 13 – are worthy of clear recognition with praise by all persons from all points of view, whether or not those other persons can appreciate or even understand the practices or excellences?",

      "title": "Corpsing; or, The Matter of Black Life",
      "abstract": "Corpsing; or, The Matter of Black Life David Marriott (bio) CORPSING AND SOCIAL DEATH The word \"corpsing\" (verb) signifies a blunder occurring when, in accordance with the performance of a role, an actor is \"put out\" of his part. A role that is corpsed is one that exposes the limits of performance and, depending on the metaphor, denotes the \"death\" of theater, as theater. A role that is corpsed, which is something contrary to the usual performance of a part, is one that evidently does away with an actor's mastery (of illusion) and no more clearly than when the dis-join between persona and part is exposed. Corpsing therefore raises the more general problem of how any kind of performance can proceed or withhold itself from the possibility of blunder when trying to follow certain rules, or at least how any performance that relies on the ability to properly communicate itself to another can do so without, conversely, also revealing that propriety as artificial and theatrical. For example, the fact that when an actor is corpsed he also reveals the necessary demise of their role, or what is most proper to its performance, it follows that the possibility of blunder—often hilariously—has a force and impetus that cannot be easily borne by the normal codes of performance, except in laughter. So too the fact that corpsing tends to produce a kind of infectious joy at the actor's expense, at his or her inability to subdue, or subordinate, the corpse (and its affects) to the governance of spectacle, authority, or ego. But the fact that something so contagious should also compel an actor to give up his part and commit himself to a particular loss of character doesn't mean that we should lose sight of the fact that corpsing is also spectacle. And while I entirely agree that corpsing is usually determined rhetorically as a kind of excess of body over representation, I also insist that the whole scandal of corpsing (its impure force) lies in this spectacle of what happens when the most self-present mastery [End Page 32] (of representation) comes across that which is both unmasterable and unrepresentable. First, insofar as corpsing reveals a discord, it is not clear from the metaphor whether corpsing denotes a failure to repress or the pleasure of failed repression, a pleasure that is also a death. Hence whatever follows from the failure of performance (that is, from performance itself insofar as we understand the corpse to be expressly, if unwittingly, performed) results also, albeit unconsciously, from the pleasures of failure. Hence the infectiousness of corpsing may quite correctly be said to follow from the spectacle of unmastering, because this spectacle depends especially on the failure of any resistance to manifest itself, insofar as the subject gives in to this failure but not without giving up on the persona of a role as I have just defined it. Second, I have said that this failure does not depend on decision or will but on the unconscious nature of performance, and a general consideration of accident and contingency cannot help us at all in the formation and ordering of particular corpsing events. For corpsing to be an event it must resist the very notion of event (i.e., as something ordered by the terms of performance, for it surpasses those terms). We are also ignorant of the actual motivations and reasons of why people corpse—that is, of why orderly forms of communication and performance succumb and fail, and therefore it is better and indeed necessary for what follows on corpsing and black social death to regard corpsing as radically contingent. It seems to be only by a metaphor that the word \"corpsing\" is applied to acting and theater. What is commonly meant by corpsing is a moment by which an actor exceeds the limits of theater and no longer is in command of a role. Corpsing, therefore, seems to have been defined more precisely as the death of theatrical artifice. But corpsing is also evident outside theater; we see it when people fail to live up to or grasp their social roles. Hence the derisive laughter attached to those...",

      "abstract": "Daedalus Winter 2007 Almost all theoretical and research approaches to violence begin with the assumption that, at its core, violence represents the breakdown of meaning, the advent of the irrational, and the commission of physical harm. Certainly the violence of language, representation, and the structures of everyday life are acknowledged as relevant examples of harm, but these are peripheral phenomena and dependent on the existence of bodily damage and vicious attack as a substrate to these more ethereal examples of violence. A similar ambiguity exists with regard to the way in which natural processes or zoological behaviors exhibit damage of a fleshy kind, but here the supposed reign of instinct and survival invites not only repugnance but also an absence of ethical evaluation. This informal cartography of the idea of violence in modern Western thinking indicates that orthodox solutions or responses to the problem of violence can only envisage its suppression, as a behavior inappropriate or misjudged to its ends. But what if violence is considered ennobling, redeeming, and necessary to the continuance of life itself? In other words, the legitimacy of violent acts is part of how they are constituted in the minds of observers, victims, and the perpetrators of such acts; and matters of legitimacy are not at all separate from the way in which given acts and behaviors are themselves considered violent in the 1⁄2rst place. Consonant with the recognition that violence is not a natural fact but a moral one, current anthropological thinking has moved steadily away from the notion that it is a given category of human behavior, easily identi1⁄2ed through its physical consequences and understood as emerging from the inadequacies of individual moral or social political systems of restraint, or from underlying genetic proclivities. In the light of not only encountering violence more frequently as part of ethnographic 1⁄2eldwork, but also through more properly understanding the historical importance of colonialism and neocolonialism in establishing certain codes of violent practice, anthropology has now moved toward ideas that Neil L.

These were originally part of a hardwired, phylogenetically adapted, nonverbal information system for implicitly conveying information about these states both among and within individual members of the species. A classification system provides two major functional classes of emotions, (1) those serving as Appetitive Wishes toward objects, and (2) those serving as Beliefs about the status of fulfillment of those and other significant wishes. Thus, emotions such as Anger and Fear indicate a wish to attack or escape from some object or situation, while Love and Surprise indicate wishes to care about or explore an object or situation. Emotional wishes, like their somatic brethren, require Consummatory Acts for their fulfillment. The result of these acts are emotions such Anxiety and Depression, which indicate Beliefs that the relevant wishes will be hard or impossible to satisfy, or Contentment and Elation, which function as Beliefs that the wishes have been or are being fulfilled. Together, emotional wishes and beliefs form a comprehensive wish-belief information feedback system with manifold causal consequences.",

      "abstract": "God is thought of as hidden in at least two ways. Firstly, God's reasons for permitting evil, particularly instances of horrendous evil, are often thought to be inscrutable or beyond our ken. Secondly, and perhaps more problematically, God's very existence and love or concern for us is often thought to be hidden from us (or, at least, from many of us on many occasions). But if we assume, as seems most plausible, that God's reasons for permitting evil will (in many, if not most, instances) be impossible for us to comprehend, would we not expect a loving God to at least make his existence or love sufficiently clear to us so that we would know that there is some good, albeit inscrutable, reason why we (or others) are permitted to suffer? In this paper I examine John Hick's influential response to this question, a response predicated on the notion of ‘epistemic distance’: God must remain epistemically distant and hence hidden from us so as to preserve our free will. Commentators of Hick's work, however, disagree as to whether the kind of free will that is thought to be made possible by epistemic distance is the freedom to believe that God exists, or the freedom to choose between good and evil, or the freedom to enter into a personal relationship with God. I argue that it is only the last of these three varieties of free will that Hick has in mind. But this kind of freedom, I go on to argue, does not necessitate an epistemically distant God, and so the problem of divine hiddenness remains unsolved.",

      "abstract": "In his influential and highly readable book Collapse, Jared Diamond claims that human-induced ecological and environmental degradation and the over-use of natural resources have caused civilizations to collapse. The term ‘collapse’ means “… a drastic decrease in human population size, and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time” (Diamond, p. 3). Adjectives such as ‘drastic’, ‘considerable’ and ‘extended’ are sufficiently imprecise to allow latitude in deciding whether or not a particular historical or contemporary episode qualifies as a collapse. Few would argue, however, that the iconic cases of Easter Island, the Maya empire and the Angkor civilization, which are among the Diamond’s focal cases, represent instances of collapse. Diamond also offers contemporary examples that are less compelling or at least less evocative. These include Rwanda, Haiti and modern day Australia and Montana; the latter two are judged to be vulnerable to collapse from environmental and resource degradation, if not yet on the brink.",

      "title": "The implications of cognitive processes for animal welfare",
      "abstract": "In general, codes that have been designed to safeguard the welfare of animals emphasize the importance of providing an environment that will ensure good health and a normal physiological and physical state, that is, they emphasize the animals' physical needs. If mental needs are mentioned, they are always relegated to secondary importance. The argument is put forward here that animal welfare is dependent solely on the cognitive needs of the animals concerned. In general, if these cognitive needs are met, they will protect the animals' physical needs. It is contended that in the few cases in which they do not safeguard the physical needs, it does not matter from a welfare point of view. The human example is given of being ill. It is argued that welfare is only adversely affected when a person feels ill, knows that he or she is ill, or even thinks that he or she is ill, all of which processes are cognitive ones. The implications for welfare of animals possessing certain cognitive abilities are discussed. For example, the extent to which animals are aware of their internal state while performing behavior known to be indicative of so-called states of suffering, such as fear, frustration, and pain, will determine how much they are actually suffering. With careful experimentation it may be possible to determine how negative they feel these states to be. Similarly, the extent to which animals think about items or events absent from their immediate environment will determine how frustrated they are in the absence of the real item or event but in the presence of the cognitive representation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When we are in a certain frame of mind, one which is not at all obviously muddled or confused, it is easy to think of everything that happens as caused by some earlier happening or happenings. Furthermore, we may then well think, events occurring at earlier times, by causing them, determine those at later times; by causing, the earlier leave no alternative but for the later to occur. There are some other further suppositions, somewhat more radical, which are also quite natural, even if they do not occur quite so easily or frequently as those just previously expressed: As things are determined so that prior events are causing everything which happens, there is no chance for any person himself to cause anything. There is, then, no possibility for you yourself to make anything happen, prior events always and inevitably taking care of things completely. Accordingly, it is not within your power to act, or to do anything at all. You are totally, completely impotent.",

Or we might say that my action is morally wrong because it harms an innocent person, or that my conscious experience is accounted for by my patterns of neural activity, or that the meaning of a sentence is generated by the meaning of its constituents. All of these examples are simplified, of course, and I do not intend to defend any particular claims of this sort. Rather, I just want to call attention to the kind of claim being made. I call this kind of talk ‘building talk’, and I call the class of relations that back it ‘building relations’. The class of building relations includes composition, constitution, grounding, property realization and the like.

      "abstract": "e may ask at least two different questions about blameworthiness: What makes someone blameworthy for something, and how blameworthy is she?1 In this paper, we shall focus on the first of these two questions.In the case below, for illustration, our immediate reaction is that Suzy is blameworthy for breaking the window: Solo Suzy: Suzy is walking down the street.When she reaches the big house on the corner, she stops and considers.She has an intense dislike for the elderly couple who lives in the house, and she has just had an idea: she is going to upset them by breaking their window on the first floor.She carefully selects a stone and hurls it toward the window.She feels a jolt of satisfaction when she hears the sound of breaking glass.Then she walks on as if nothing has happened.In virtue of what is Suzy blameworthy for breaking the window in this case?More generally: What distinguishes cases where an agent is blameworthy for something-an action, omission, or outcome-from cases where she is not?2We aim to develop a compatibilist answer to this question.In doing so, we shall draw on two important approaches in the literature: the quality-of-will approach and the actual-sequence approach.definitions, we shall refer simply to poor quality of will, leaving it open precisely how this should be understood.In our discussions, though, we often adopt Björnsson's proposal and understand quality of will in terms of care.The reader is free to substitute their own preferred understanding.In this paper, we present a new way to develop the Basic Idea.First, we argue that it needs to be refined in a number of ways (section 1).Next, we present an account of the relevant causal-explanatory relation (section 2) and finalize the account of when you are blameworthy for actions, omissions, and outcomes, testing it on a number of cases (section 3).Finally, we show that this account also gives the right verdict in Frankfurt-style cases (section 4) and in collective-harm cases (section 5). Developing the Basic IdeaThe Basic Idea already gives the intuitively right verdict in paradigm cases of blameworthiness for, such as Solo Suzy, where the intuitive verdict is that Suzy is blameworthy for throwing the rock toward the window (an action) and for breaking the window (an outcome).Here, Suzy has a poor quality of will-she dislikes the elderly couple who lives in the house and wants to break their window in order to upset them.Furthermore, Suzy's poor quality of will just before she throws her rock stands in the right causal-explanatory relation both to her throwing the rock and to the breaking of the window: Suzy's poor quality of will causes/ explains her throwing the rock and the breaking of the window.Thus, Suzy is blameworthy both for throwing the rock and for the breaking of the window.In Solo Suzy, Suzy intentionally breaks the window.In other cases, however, you may be blameworthy for something even though you did not do it or bring it about intentionally.8When you have a poor quality of will, you may forget things you should remember, you may fail to notice things, or neglect to consider them.Suppose, for example, that you do not care as you should and therefore forget your best friend's birthday.In that case, we think that you are blameworthy for forgetting the birthday-even though, of course, you did not 8 Voluntarists about moral responsibility such as Fischer and Ravizza (Responsibility and Control) and Rosen (\"The Alethic Conception of Moral Responsibility\") would not agree.According to them, voluntary control is a precondition on being blameworthy, and you do not have voluntary control over, e.g., forgetting something.Still, it seems that you are blameworthy for something in such cases.Here, voluntarists typically argue that you are blameworthy for some earlier action or decision that you did have voluntary control over (given that you also satisfy some epistemic condition), such as failing to add a note in your calendar about your friend's birthday.This is the tracing strategy.There are, however, problems with the tracing strategy (see, e.g., Smith, \"Attitudes, Tracing, and Control\").This secures the verdict that Suzy is blameworthy for throwing the rock: (1) Suzy's throwing the rock (X) is worse than her not throwing it (X*), at least partly in virtue of the old couple's getting upset (Y) being worse than their not getting upset (Y*); and (2) the time t just before she throws is such that Suzy's poor quality of will at t in relation to the elderly couple's getting upset (Y) versus not getting upset (Y*) stands in the right causal-explanatory relation to her throwing the rock (X) rather than not (X*).We similarly get the verdict that Suzy is blameworthy for breaking the window.In cases where you do have a poor quality of will directly in relation to X versus X*, we may set Y = X and Y* = X*, effectively making Blameworthiness For #3 equivalent to Blameworthiness For #2, which is easier to use.In such cases, we will say that X just is worse than X* (leaving it open in virtue of what X is worse than X*).In this way, Blameworthiness For #3 straightforwardly gives the verdict that Suzy is blameworthy for the elderly couple's getting upset rather than not. Characterizing the Right Causal-Explanatory RelationUntil now, we have relied on an intuitive understanding of \"the right causal-explanatory relation.\"In this section, we suggest that the relevant relation just is causation.The success of this kind of suggestion depends critically on the account of causation that is used.We consider this in detail and suggest that",

A thing can remain essentially intact without being whole or integral. A car on its trials with engine, wheels and chassis only is essentially a car but it has no integrity. Or again we use integrity of a character that has preserved the wholeness of a good moral life or of fidelity to truth, as opposed to the one who has compromised either of these perfections by his conduct or dishonesty—for even should he repent he will lack something; he will lack that unity of a life unbroken by sin. By integration, then, we mean that quality of wholeness which is given to a thing when it is finally completed; and when applied to human life this quality can only be gauged with respect to the whole of life from childhood to old age, a life begun with a certain perfection given by God the Creator, but with a hundred conflicting possibilities and powers which have to be co-ordinated into a whole, i.e., integrated. It is just this element of intactness which is absent in modern life. We manage on the whole to preserve the essentials of life for we continue, at least barely, to Jive. But there is no sense of completeness about it. Our home life is one thing, our work another, our leisure another, and our religion something apart from all these: all are divided off into separate compartments.",

Property owned and con? trolled by the same person is natural in the sense that it is in accord with the original human nature. This natural relationship is based on love that intermediates the use of means and the intended ends of the owner for which means are adapted. When an owner directly manages his own business (means), whether successful or unsuccess? ful, we are assured that the owner-manager never knowingly turns against the goals or ends of his business and that the diversion in the use of means away from the intended ends cannot occur. The ugly outbreak of embezzlement, of padded expense accounts, of kick-backs, and of bribes, cannot infiltrate this natural relationship. Obviously, the owner cannot steal from his own pocket. Neither can he squander the company's money without depleting his own treasury. A bribe cannot corrupt him because the favor sought from him is worth more to him than the bribe.

The main findings are the perfect application of the element of retributive ‘proportionality’ in all diyyah laws. The proportionality proved to be the basic rule of diyyah punishment where the homicide along with the bodily harms are proportionally compensated with the principle amount of hundred camels, ten thousand silver dirhams or one thousand gold dinars keeping in view the utility or the number of body parts of that organ. The damage to entire body in the shape of death, complete damage to a sense, to an organ or its utility, is proportionally compensated with full diyyah however the organs having more than one part are compensated with the proportional amount to the number of that body part in human body which results in half diyyah for damage to one hand, leg, eye or eyebrow and quarter for each eyelid. In this way each organ, its utility or each sense is proportionally compensated with adequate and proportional diyyah amount.",

It is also about how people give up their addictions, and therefore about what therapists can do to help them. It will turn out that overcoming an addiction is rarely a matter of vanquishing it but more often a matter of giving in to a realization of the need for something bigger and more powerful than oneself, a process that Heidegger terms ‘releasement’ (von Deurzen, 1997). The word ‘addiction’ is used advisedly here, even though it is no longer fashionable. It has generally been replaced by the words ‘dependency’, as in chemical dependency, or by the term ‘misuse’, as in substance misuse. Dependency connotes a particular image of someone who is needy and dependent on other people. There is no evidence that these personality traits are particularly linked to becoming addicted, however. Misuse does not capture the imperative nature of the problem. Heroin, as an illicit substance, is misused every time that it is used. Yet there are people who manage to confine their heroin use to a level which they would not consider to be problematic. The ‘demandingness’ of heroin addiction – its admixture of pleasure and self-destruction – is not really conveyed by the much more neutral term, ‘misuse’, which could apply equally well to the recreational user.",

for we have seen that the most perfect memory a memory probably more perfect, and certainly more minute, than that of any person of superior intelligence can exist with very little judg-i ment, or with none at all.Is it the novelty then tNo ; not altogether, and probably not at all ; for in that case, we would surely best remember the great- est novelty ; and that unquestionably is the first sight we get of the world.The reason why we remember cannot be explained by the individual things that we remember ; and as little can it be owing to any act of the mind, con- sidered as such.Where then shall we seek for it ?We shall best answer that question by putting another, and pausing to weigh it well before we answer it.How came we by all that we think and know, or by all that we can think *?The answer to that question, if the right one, will show us where the mine of knowledge is, and how that mine can be worked ; and if we know these, no matter how small our present stock of knowledge may be, we shall soon and easily obtain more as much more as we please.That is a very simple question, a question the answer to which requires no philosophy, no learn- ing, no reading, nay not even the faculty of speech ; and yet that question is the seal upon all the possi- ble knowledge of which we are not in possession ; and many of us live long and go down to our graves in ignorance merely because we do not see, orj seeing, will not take the trouble to break that seal.That truth is so very important that we must dwell MERE SENSATION.the purely mental act of perceiving relation, and the mind's act through the senses in perceiving reality ; and for that reason we generally use only half our system work with half our strength.Not half of it even no, not a tenth ; for the real power is in the union of the two.When we use our senses, we do not think; and so the object of those senses can be turned to no profit, and give us no pleasure.If we do not think at the same time, the appearances of objects have no more effect upon our organs of sense than sun- beams when they play on the snow-clad summit of a lofty mountain ; they are reflected away in an in- stant ; and that which would have warmed a more genial place into life and beauty is gone wasted, never to return.How, scorpion-like, a little bit of the tail of some day spent in favourable places, but spent thoughtlessly, will turn and sting us with the remorse of how much we have lost, and lost never to be recalled or replaced !How often, even when the most delightfully instructive prospects are before us, have we reason to address ourselves in the words of Macbeth to the ghost of his murdered friend : \" Thou hast no speculation in these eyes Which thou dost glare with.\"And we, too, are murderers, and murderers \"red hand\" in the fact, and not in the remorse caused by the dogging ghost of that which we are murdering.We are murdering Time the means of all know- ledge, and the measure of all enjoying ; and, inde- pendently of the direct loss, which is irreparable, if the ghost of murdered Time shall, at any period, rise and haunt us, it is one of the most terrible of ghosts, and we must abide its tormentings alone and unpitied.This abuse of our time, and neglect of thinking, instead of working its own cure, throws us into the opposite fault; and, just because we have gazed without thinking, we think without observing, andJose both the time and the thought ; and lose it in 'nature.If we loiter on the sleepless pillow, and have not resolution enough to get up, then our torment lasts till the dawn has so far advanced as that we can see distinctly, or till the beams of the early sun are breaking in through the chink of the shutters, or the opening of the curtains ; but soon after even the articles of the room are revealed to our observation, our minds are tranquillized, and we glide into dozing slumber.",

Butchered bones may be recovered as important behavioral evidence from archaeological sites, or they may be collected within the forensic context and mistaken for human bones with marks of trauma. Archaeologists can use these butchery marks to study the ways in which past human populations butchered, distributed, and consumed meat. In a forensic context, tool marks on bone may be a good indication that the remains are nonhuman in origin, but this is not always the case. The intentional dismemberment of a human body by another individual (usually with the goal of hindering identification or facilitating transportation of the remains) may mimic the appearance of a butchered cow or pig to the untrained observer. An experienced osteologist should always be consulted if there is any doubt. Figure 18–01 shows several commercially butchered cow bones that were mistaken for human remains and turned over to law enforcement.

      "title": "Altruism in behavioural, motivational and evolutionary sense",
      "abstract": "This paper discusses the relations between three forms of altruism: behavioural, evolutionary and motivational. Altruism in a behavioural sense is an act that benefits another person. It can range from volunteering to a charity and helping a neighbour, to giving money to a non-profit organisation or donating blood. People often dedicate their material and nonmaterial resources for the benefit of others to gain psychological, social and material benefits for themselves. Thus, their altruistic acts are driven by egoistic motivation. Also, the final goal of an altruistic act may be the increase in the welfare of a group or adherence to a certain moral principle or a social norm. However, at least sometimes, the welfare of others is the ultimate goal of our actions, when our altruistic acts are performed from altruistic motivation. In evolutionary sense, altruism means the sacrifice of reproductive success for the benefit of other organisms. According to evolutionary theories, behaviour which promotes the reproductive success of the receiver at the cost of the actor is favoured by natural selection, because it is either beneficial for the altruist in the long run, or for his genes, or for the group he belongs to. However, altruism among people emerges as a distinctly human combination of innate and learned behaviours. Not only do we benefit the members of our own group, but we are capable of transcending our tribalistic instincts and putting the benefit of strangers at our own personal expense as our ultimate goal.",

      "title": "Capital Mitigation Evidence in the Seventh Circuit",
      "abstract": "Rather, I plead with you to see a mode of life in our midst, a mode of life stunted and distorted, but possessing its own laws and claims, an existence of men growing out of the soil prepared by the collective but blind will of a hundred million people. I beg you to recognize human life draped in a form and guise alien to ours, but springing from a soil plowed and sown by all our hands. I ask you to recognize the laws and processes flowing from such a condition, understand them, seek to change them. If we do none of these, then we should not pretend horror or surprise when thwarted life expresses itself in fear and hate and crime.1 Richard Wright 1. INTRODUCTION A capital defendant's goal at sentencing is simple: to save his life. To this end, the defendant will present evidence of his good character to show that he is a human being whose life has value. Family members, friends, coworkers, and others are introduced to the judge or jury to convince them that they should vote for life.2 No defendant limits himself to character evidence, nor should he. Rather, he introduces causality evidence, evidence that his background and history should instead be indicted, to make the sentencer understand that he himself cannot and should not be held fully responsible for his actions.3 This is done by offering evidence of, among other things, a troubled upbringing, mental deficiency, abuse as a child, an unstable family, and a lack of opportunity throughout life. All of these facts are brought together with character evidence to show that the defendant does not deserve a punishment as severe as death.' Unfortunately, there are times when an attorney representing a capital defendant, due to incompetence, makes no attempt to discover or present such mitigating evidence and the defendant's plea for life is rendered nugatory. This usually results in an appeal of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington.5 Under Strickland, the appellate court is required to consider all the mitigating evidence that could have been presented at sentencing and decide whether those facts would have persuaded the sentencer to choose life.6 The Seventh Circuit, in an opinion authored by Chief Judge Richard Posner, questioned this scheme in 1996 in the case of Stewart v. Gramley.7 In Stewart, the court ruled that evidence reducing the defendant's culpability would not be considered in a Strickland claim.8 The purpose of mitigation is to discover evidence of a good character, the court argued, not to show that the defendant's past compelled him to commit the crime. The court's rejection of causality evidence during mitigation signaled a dramatic shift in its capital jurisprudence. No longer was causality evidence to be included in a Strickland analysis 9 However, the Seventh Circuit's new, limited approach to mitigation failed to account for the settled Eighth Amendment rule that causality evidence must be considered at sentencing.10 Furthermore, the new approach ignored the fact that limiting evidence considered in a Strickland review violates the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.11 This Comment considers the recent development of capital mitigation jurisprudence by the Seventh Circuit. It concludes that the Seventh Circuit's redefinition of mitigating evidence excluding causality evidence is unconstitutional under the Sixth and Eighth Amendments and should be rejected. Part II explores the Seventh Circuit's initial interpretation of the scope of mitigating evidence after Strickland, and how the court redefined the scope in Stewart v. Gramley.12 Part II concludes with an examination of the Seventh Circuit's new definition of mitigation that has developed since Stewart. Part III discusses the source of the Eighth Amendment right to mitigating evidence, the scope and nature of that right, and the preservation of that right by the Sixth Amendment. Part IV analyzes the Seventh Circuit's new definition of mitigating evidence under the Sixth and Eighth Amendments and suggests that the court return to its prior mitigation scheme. …",

We must, before dealing with it, preface that ownership and communion are moral qualities that do not physically and intrinsically affect things themselves but produce only a moral effect in relation to other men, and that these qualities-like the rest of this sort-refer their birth back to imposition. Hence it is foolish to ask whether ownership of things is by nature or, indeed, the result of institution. For it is obvious that it arises from the imposition of men, and that whether ownership is added to or withdrawn from things, their physical substance experiences no change.",

This sets the stage for these people to turn even further inward and become “beautiful souls.” One of them says that since every case involves a lot of complicated facts, he never acts until he has all the facts available, and thus even if things turn out badly, he thus always does what is pure and right in the circumstances. The other says he never acts until he has all the facts, but since he never has all of them, he never acts but only judges. Each claims a purity that is invisible to the other, and each accuses the other of evil or hypocrisy. This sets the stage for both recognizing themselves second-personally in the other through mutual forgiveness and reconciliation.",

      "title": "Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy",
      "abstract": "In 1495 Leonardo Da Vinci designed what was to be the first automated humanoid and it is speculated that this was to be for the entertainment of royalty. It is not known whether an actual prototype was ever built. The word robot was first introduced by the Czech writer Karel Capek in his play Rossum’s Universal Robots (R.U.R) in 1920. The Czech word robota means labor or servitude. The play takes place on an island where the robot factory is producing robots to be sold to the world as cheap labor. The robots turn around and try to take over the world and end the human race. Isaac Asimov wrote a sequence of short stories in 1940 on the difficulties that would be faced if autonomous robots populated the Earth. He laid 3 laws of robotics which state “(the first law) A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm, (the second law) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with First Law and (the third law) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First and Second Law”. As his writings became more intricate and complex, so did the relationship between man and robot. He then felt the need to add another law which was more basic and more important than the first three which he then called the zeroth law “A robot may not injure humanity, or through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm”. This gave a broader picture of the laws governing robots. Robotic technology is now incorporated into our everyday life which can range from the large manufacturing assembly lines to everyday household chores. The field of Medicine is no exception where robotic applications are gaining momentum. One of the first robotic applications came from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) in 1969. They designed a robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom (6-dof) all-electric mechanical manipulator exclusively for computer control. The Stanford Arm and SAIL helped to develop the knowledge base which has been applied in essentially all the industrial robots. The first commercially available robotic system was the ROBODOC which was used for orthopedic surgery. AESOP was designed to allow the surgeon greater control over visualization and to eliminate the need for an assistant holding the scope. The ZEUS robot was then developed which had a two-dimensional imaging system. Intuitive Surgical Inc (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Moutain View, CA) developed the Da Vinci robotic system and the first successful surgery was performed in 1997 in Belgium. The Da Vinci Robotic system is now also utilized by gynecologists to perform a number of procedures including hysterectomy myomectomy, tubal reversal and sacrocolpopexy as",

      "abstract": "D efinition. By the phrase are gathered together any and all expressions of attitude and opinion which have a predictive character, or represent a readiness to act on the assumption of some probability. There is a blending or linkage between various kinds of predictive assumptions, which makes almost interchangeable the terms used to describe them. Predictive assumptions include expectant attitudes, gestures (significant incipient acts), prejudices, curses, hypotheses, prognoses, reputations, stereotypes, epithets, conceptions of role, definitions of the situation, myths. Let us suggest further the common denominators of these states of mind. Analysis. It would seem that one of the earliest, because inevitable, effects of those modes of mentation which we call imagination, objectification, self-consciousness, foresight, etc., must have been to produce in human beings reactions to their own (or others' communicated) definitions of situations. Men responded to their own ideas or images of the projected future. These reactions would, of course, take the form of positive (accelerative) or negative (avoidance) responses-both attitudes and overt behaviorsaccording as the prospect predicted seemed desirable or undesirable; and the processes of evaluation and reaction toward their own (or others') expectations or curses would be a factor in the fulfillment or nonfulfillment thereof. For present purposes, it was realized that the significant points for distinctions and classifications are whether the predictive assumption is (i) in opposition to, or (2) in accordance with, the wishes of those who are to do the responding. An epithet always has its opposite. A reputation for doing something can always be rephrased as avoidance of something else. A prediction can be couched in negative or positive terms. The actual responses and results may similarly be described negatively or positively,' depending upon the emphasis in one's attention at the time. In either case behavior has occurred. Negative and positive are verbalized relativities. On the biophysical level (the unconscious) there is no negative or positive.2",

      "title": "The Ethics of Killing",
      "abstract": "Abstract A comprehensive study of the ethics of killing in cases in which the metaphysical or moral status of the individual killed is uncertain or controversial. Among those beings whose status is questionable or marginal in this way are human embryos and fetuses, newborn infants, animals, anencephalic infants, human beings with severe congenital and cognitive impairments, and human beings who have become severely demented or irreversibly comatose. In an effort to understand the moral status of these beings, this book develops and defends distinctive accounts of the nature of personal identity, the evaluation of death, and the wrongness of killing. The central metaphysical claim of the book is that we are neither nonmaterial souls nor human organisms but are instead embodied minds. In ethical theory, one of the central claims is that the morality of killing is not unitary; rather, the principles that determine the morality of killing in marginal cases are different from those that govern the killing of persons who are self‐conscious and rational. Another important theme is that killing in marginal cases should be evaluated in terms of the impact it would have on the victim at the time rather than on the value of the victim's life as a whole. What primarily matters is how killing would affect that which would be rational for the victim to care about at the time of death. By appealing to various foundational claims about identity, death, and the morality of killing, this book yields novel conclusions about such issues as abortion, prenatal injury, infanticide, the killing of animals, the significance of brain death, the termination of life support in cases of persistent vegetative state, the use of anencephalic infants as sources of organs for transplantation, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and advance directives in cases of dementia. In particular, the book defends the moral permissibility of abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia in certain cases and argues that brain death is not the appropriate criterion of death either for a person or a human organism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Placing the suspect at the crime scene is an important element in the solution of a crime. A way to do this is to find textile fibers like those from the victim’s environment or the crime scene on the clothing of the suspect. Another way would be to discover fibers like the suspect’s clothing or environment on the victim or at the crime scene. When fibers exhibiting the same microscopic characteristics and optical properties are found in common between a known source and the suspect or victim, an evidentiary value is placed on that association. This value is dependent on many factors that include the type(s) of fibers found (natural or synthetic), the color (s) of the fibers, number of fibers found, the location of fibers on a victim, suspect and/or crime scene and the number of different fibers that “match,” especially if different fibers from the same item of clothing or fibers from more than one item of clothing are found.",

      "abstract": "Catholic moral theology teaches that life is sacred but not absolute. Because life and all activities are subordinated to spiritual ends, it is moral to allow oneself to die when efforts to prolong life will bring no significant benefit and may even make it more difficult to finish life in peace, composure, and union with God. This is not the moral equivalent of suicide, but rather an acceptance of the human condition. In making such a decision, the distinction between morally ordinary and extraordinary means is crucial and based on the patient's total good. Ordinary means are those which offer a reasonable hope of benefit without excessive expense, pain, or other inconvenience. Extraordinary means are those which cannot be obtained without excessive burden or which, if used, would not offer a reasonable hope of benefit. Whether a medical procedure is standard or experimental does not, from a moral viewpoint, affect whether it is ordinary or extraordinary. In Catholic teaching, the patient has the paramount right to decide whether life-preserving measures will be used. If the patient is unable to make this decision, then the family should make it as the patient's representative.",

Human beings have a sense of superiority when they see other animals (typically dogs, cats, farm animals, and birds) appear to act as if they thought themselves human—ignoring the fact that the reverse delusion is sometimes suffered by human beings themselves. Behind this sense of superiority lies the assumption that the interpretation of reality, including the definition of what is human, is essentially and uniquely a human preserve.",

Sacrifices are made to God or to gods in the hope of obtaining something which is beyond the realm of human action – something which can be achieved only by a more powerful force: a good harvest, health, protection from misfortune, continued life, a better life, and finally, eternal life itself. Sacrifices are made to God, or to the gods, in the hope that in their omnipotence they will grant those things which are believed to be essential to life, but which cannot be achieved by humans. This adds greatly to the subtleties within the performance of cult and ritual, and also increases the value of the sacrificial object itself. In order to obtain from God that which is unobtainable by humanity, the most valuable of items are offered, even human life. As a result sacrifice always involves art and ceremony, the most precious of human things in their highest form.",

Another impact that is feared to emerge is the attitude of fatalism, which is the attitude or understanding of a person who is hopeless in everything, and he says it is determined by fate, until he is a priori and stagnant. This attitude must be watched out, because it can interfere with the various efforts made to prevent the spread of Covid 19. This treatment cannot be compounded farsial, but must be thorough, compact and together. Therefore we need the roles of people or humans as Abdullah, as social beings or as khalifah? Through these roles, transgression as a servant will appear in his personality as a person of strong faith, as a social being, his social piety will be shown, one of which is shown by caring for others or in existing conditions, while the soul of the Caliphate can guarantee calm, comfort for community members with exemplary, patronized ways to make life orderly and orderly in accordance with current social norms. The purpose of this research is to find out about how the role of humans in fatalist life, to know in detail what must be done in the face of a fatalist life, so he can still survive istiqomah.

      "title": "Evidence of Multiple Personality Disorder in Handwriting",
      "abstract": "orensic handwriting identification links the handwriting of an unknown document with a suspected author in cases involving forged checks, credit card charge slips, anonymous letters, and ransom notes. It is also used to determine the genuineness of someone’s signature on documents such as wills, contracts, and trusts. This type of testimony has been accepted in state and federal courts for over 100 years. The individuality in our handwriting, which allows it to be identified with us is caused by a number of factors: the schools we attended; our parents; our sense of neatness; the size of our hands, fingers, and arms; and our eyesight. All of these factors make handwriting a product of the brain: neurological transmissions come through the arms and fingers to impart uniqueness into our handwriting. The material for this article originates from a medical malpractice case examined by the author in which a dispute arose regarding when the plaintiff acquired multiple personality disorder (MPD), an ‘‘abnormal condition in which two or more well developed personalities exist within the same individual. Awareness of the others among the various personalities may not occur. Each may take over at a certain time. Change from one to another is usually sudden and linked to stress.’’ Mosby Medical Encyclopedia. My role was to examine diaries authored by the plaintiff from 1986‐1991 and determine if evidence existed of different writers. The original diaries were used for the analysis. All parties agreed that the diaries and entries were prepared on their respective dates so the possibility that they were all made at one time after the filing of the lawsuit was not an issue. Consequently, no ink dating tests were performed. The examination consisted of comparing the handwriting habits in the diaries with each other to determine if they were consistent, inconsistent, contrived, or if evidence of different authors was present. The results were startling. Most of us see differences in our handwriting from day to day, which can be caused by haste, writing position, fatigue, stress, or writing surface. In these diary entries, which appeared under different names, were four distinct handwriting styles. They presented not only pictorial differences, but the writing systems themselves",

Two men, A and B, are shipwrecked on the high seas; as their strength ebbs and they are about to drown, they see a wooden plank that is just large enough to support only one of them. A reaches the plank first and grabs it, but B, faced with the prospect of certain death, pushes A off the plank, resulting in the death of A by drowning. B then grabs the plank and manages to save his own life. Should B have a defence if he is prosecuted for pushing A off the plank in these circumstances?",

That such restitutional attempts fail and instead reflect the murderous (both the anal and the genital) intent is no surprise for the psychoanalyst who regularly witnesses contradictory aims in the manifestations of all the neuroses and psychoses including the obsessional. The observations (as well as a host of other clinical phenomena) indicate the intimate relation of anxiety to the aggressive strivings (despite the fact that anxiety instigates repression of the sexual wishes). Anxiety serves as a precipitant of repression and symptom formation while guilt, both conscious and unconscious manifestations, is a product of the oedipal sexual wishes.",

In the event of a nuclear war, why is second-strike retaliation so certain when it may gain nothing of social or material value? We believe these things because humans share a universal thirst for retaliation in the face of threat and in the wake of loss, no matter what classical economists may say to the contrary about how people “should” behave. Indeed, the psychology of revenge and the hatred on which it rests make a seemingly irrational second strike entirely credible. We can apply this analysis to nuclear weapons, but the basic drive is no different than the one that makes most people want to kill anyone who threatens their child, or to hurt a cheating spouse. The instinct for revenge is universal, automatic, and immediate. It also serves a function: to deter the threat of future exploitation.",

According to the Holy Qur’an, they are deemed to be miracles of the Almighty Allah and signs of His existence and Unity. All of them worship Allah in a way that we are unable to see or feel. By and large, all creatures including these animals are created for the benefit of humankind. Some of these animals are consumed as food or meat; some of them are used for riding on their backs or carrying goods; while some others are kept as pets or used for other purposes. Most of them are wild, while some of them are domestic. However, some of them are harmful to mankind. Nowadays, besides the use of plants and bacteria, animal cells are also used for industrial or scientific purposes and for making drugs and chemicals. Human beings often treat these animals with cruelty and fail to treat them ethically. During the last century or so a number of organizations for protecting animal rights have been established all over the world. Islam has also offered some ethical guidelines for treating animals. By analyzing the related verses of the Qur’an and ahadith of the Prophet (pbuh), this paper intends to discuss Islamic ethics for treating animals. The paper may conclude that Islam has offered a balanced and just code of ethics for treating animals.",

      "title": "The phenomenon of prehistoric ritual pits: Several examples from the central Balkans",
      "abstract": "In recent years, the phenomenon of pits with special deposits, i.e. ritual pits, seems to have, once again, attracted attention both in Europe and in the Balkans. In the central Balkans, scientific literature related to this topic is still deficient, hence one of the objectives of this paper is to change the current state and rekindle interest in the study of this form of manifestation of the spiritual culture of prehistoric man. It appears that one of the oldest reasons for sacrificial offerings is primal, instinctive fear. The fear of the transience of life or of death compelled our ancient ancestors to make some sort of ?agreement? with the surrounding forces, bestowing particular sacrifices onto them. Sacrifice represents one of the rituals of prehistoric communities which could have been performed in a number of ways and in different circumstances. One of these are offerings placed in pits, in the form of specific objects, food, drink or living beings sacrificed to higher powers and accompanied by certain symbolic actions, for the purpose of gaining their favour or help. When interpreting pits, what should further be considered is that the fundamental difference between a discarded object and an object used for a ritual purpose lies in the fact that the object of ritual character is still meaningful to man, performing a symbolic function, unlike the former, whose role is lost after being disposed of. Aritual object, an item or a living being sacrificed in a pit, is no longer of common, worldly significance (food, drink, tools, etc.), but rather possesses a symbolic, sacral meaning, intended for higher powers, to propitiate and appease them, that is to create some form of the oldest religious communication. Not only is it difficult to identify the pits used for ritual purposes in the course of fieldwork, but it is even more challenging to interpret them and practically impossible to accurately reconstruct the actions performed during the rituals. Many authors who concern themselves with this topic concur that the context of a pit and the objects within it, the choice of offerings and their symbolism, along with the pit?s stratigraphy and other patterns observed in it, are in fact the features that make it distinct, i.e. ritual. Similar pits are known throughout history and their descriptions can be found in ancient written sources, as well as identified in the field, with certain differences, stretching back all the way into deep prehistory. This paper presents several newly discovered ritual pits in the central Balkans from the Eneolithic, Bronze and Iron Age, and additionally mentions some of the previously published pits from the area and its near and more distant surroundings. In the course of recent investigations conducted at the site of Bubanj, two ritual pits were recorded in the Early Eneolithic horizon of the Bubanj-Hum I culture. Next to the first, shallower (up to 0.2 m), oval shaped pit, of around 2.5 m long and 1.7 m wide, an oven was noted, while the pit was filled with whole vessels, parts of grindstones, chipped and polished stone tools, baked clay, animal bones, etc. (Figs. 1, 2; Pl. I). Two smaller hollows were noted in the northern part of the pit, while several postholes, which might have supported some kind of roof or shelter construction, were detected somewhat deeper in the subsoil, around the oven and the pit. Below this pit, a smaller one was noted, around 0.7 m deep and with a base diameter of about 1.2 m, filled with yellow, sandy, refined soil. The bottom of the pit was dug to the level of the subsoil and levelled. The second ritual pit from Bubanj was considerably deeper (around 1.5 m) and approximately 1.7 m in diameter, with baked walls and filled with red ashy soil. It contained fragmented or whole vessels, chipped stone tools, a part of an altar, an air nozzle (tuy?res), a polished stone axe, tools made of horn, a fragment of a grindstone, pebbles, house daub and animal bones (Fig. 3; Pl. II). Part of the inventory had been burnt, particularly in the lower section of the pit. This paper also mentions the Late Eneolithic pit from Vinca, containing eight whole vessels in an inverted position (Fig. 4; Pl. III), as well as the Bronze Age complexes from Kokino Selo and Pelince, in northern Macedonia (Figs. 5, 6), comprising several dozen pits, commonly with a broken stone construction, in which whole vessels, along with tools made from chipped and polished stone, baked clay or bone and large amounts of daub were discovered. In the Iron Age, the number of ritual pits significantly increased in all of Europe and, from this period, two pits from the area surrounding Vranje are presented - one with mixed contents (the skulls, without the lower jaw, of at least six male wild boars, as well as the skulls, lower jaws, right pelvic bones and shoulder blades of at least six deer, along with parts of grindstones, pottery and daub fragments and a chipped stone tool) and the other with a complete skeleton of a young female horse, a baked clay weight and chipped stone flaking debris (Figs. 7, 8; Pl. IV).1 The pits were dated, by means of conventional C14 dating, to the period from the mid-6th to the mid-4th century BC.2 By comparing and analysing a large number of pits from the central Balkans and the neighbouring areas, it was observed that ritual pits, as a form of an ancient, primitive religiosity, had already emerged in the Palaeolithic and endured in Europe throughout the entire prehistory, despite various natural and social changes that occurred during this extended period. The pits proved to have been located both outside inhabited areas, as well as in settlements (even under houses), either individually or clustered, and in some cases also constituting entire complexes, with protective architecture in the form of a roof or a shelter (Bubanj, Ohoden). The surface areas occupied by the complexes, along with the dimensions and shapes of the pits, the stratigraphy of their contents, their architecture and many other elements vary considerably, even within a single complex. It is for this reason that it is not possible, at this moment in time, at least without very detailed and comprehensive analysis, to discern some regularities or patterns which could, with any certainty, be considered reliable. This primeval custom, therefore, cannot be linked to any particular period, culture or region, but was entirely dependent on the state or level of the spiritual consciousness of an individual or a community. This religious idea started to decline during the Roman domination and vanished entirely at the time of Christianity.",

      "abstract": "Man is in his fallen state because of his own disobedience. Disobedience springs from pride which, as St Bede says, does its own will. In his pride and disobedience man is separated from God and can only return to him by following the path of virtue, by making reparation through humility and obedience. Christ who came to do the will of his Father is a model for our obedience. Religious obedience is but Christian obedience in the wake of Christ's own, carried to its conclusion by which we are made one with him. Satan was the first to begin to question the commands of obedience. ‘Why’, he said, ‘did God command you not to eat of the tree of good and evil ?’ (Gen. 3). Before this, man who was without guile obeyed without reserve, not so much because of the reasonableness of the command but because of the authority of the commander. For just as faith in what human reason has experienced is not meritorious, so obedience is separated from the virtue of humility when the reason for the command is in agreement with it. But you wish to hear why we should act or cease to act in accordance with another's will or command. The reason is because in this way especially we are imitators of Christ, as dearest sons; and we walk in the love with which we loved us. He was made obedient in all things for us, not only to assist us but also to be an example, so that as he behaved so may we behave in this world.",

      "title": "Shared Reality in the Self-system: The Social Nature of Self-regulation",
      "abstract": "How others respond to us communicates about the nature of the world around us and our place in it. By accepting these messages about who we are in the world, we create a shared reality with the significant others in our lives that becomes the basis for self-regulation. This shared reality includes the message that the world either has accomplishments to be promoted, inducing a promotion focus, or has dangers and mistakes to be prevented, inducing a prevention focus. Evidence is presented that these different types of regulatory focus influence both people's memory for different life events and their emotional responses to them. Evidence is also presented that: (a) self-regulatory confusion occurs when shared reality with different significant others about desired selves is in conflict; (b) alienation is produced when there is a lack of shared reality with others about one's actual self; and (c) people prefer information about their actual selves that is shared with significant others as compared to equally self-relevant but unshared information. In these ways, shared reality shapes the world that we experience.",

The analysis of text resulted in nine themes, and many behavioural outcomes of śraddhā such as not finding faults in others. Jñāna or knowledge is seen as mediating between śraddhā and mokṣa or liberation. This relationship is moderated by tatparaḥ (or eager engagement in the spiritual practice one has chosen) and saṃyatendriyaḥ (or practicing self-restraint). Śraddhā is considered as one of the highest virtues. It is a gift of God. It always bears fruits which carry over to the next life. The highest quality of śraddhā is that of a devotee. From interpersonal perspective, śraddhā is an emotion one has for another person, a deity, God or śāstra (scriptural text or instructions in such texts that guide human behaviour). Śraddhā reflects the basic nature of people. Absence of śraddhā causes all efforts to go in vain. The nine themes that are discussed present a thick description of this indigenous construct and open avenues for future research.",

Most treatments of this problem have tended to assume there is but one sort of entity properly to be called an action, and hence that one answer to this question must be established to the exclusion of all others. And the favored answer has been that Booth's actions are not discrete, or indeed even overlapping, but identical. It is possible, however, to adopt a more conciliatory spirit, in which a place is sought for talk of discrete or fine-grained actions in cases like this, as well as for entities of the coarser sort most have favored.",

      "abstract": "The article critically represents Derek Parfit’s view on personal identity and its connection with our bodies. During the discussion with animalists who claim that persons are identical with bodies Parfit defends Lockean view and concludes that person isn’t identical with human being and easily can exist beyond it. Yet it seems obvious that person isn’t identical with body, such views lead to the controversial effects. For example, Parfit claims that abortion or euthanasia wouldn’t be a crime. This article discusses some of the most debatable basics of Parfit’s position and suggests at least three points worth of next thinking. At first, the author highlights that the so-called psychological criterion of personal identity is rather conventional. At second, the real experience of personal life doesn’t match with the famous Lockean definition, because we have no any continuity. At third, D. Parfit doesn’t explain what it means to be an animal (or human animal). If there is some biological «base» of a person (head, cerebrum, or part of a cerebrum), it still stays an animal. In the conclusion of the article the author suggests that we are not human beings, nor persons. But it doesn’t mean that we can’t become them",

      "abstract": "Christianity, as a theistic religion, defines spirituality as obedience (i.e., hearing and doing) God’s Word/Will, not without discussion, dialogue and even debate. This process of hearing and doing implies a mental procedure known technically as discernment which ensures that it is genuinely God’s word/will that one hears and executes. The question discussed in this paper is who or what stands in the way of discernment. The general answer is “Satan” a rational creature, who goes by many other names. The Author asks whether it is necessary to have recourse to such an external agent and proposes an alternative explanation as a mere hypothesis, namely that the “serpent” mentioned in Genesis 3,1-24 need not refer to an agent outside the human person (such as Satan) but symbolizes human reason misled by greed or inordinate passion. This hypothesis avoids the contradiction between the belief in all-loving and all-powerful God on the one hand and an irredeemably wicked rational being either created by God or having an independent existence.",

      "title": "\"His Apparel Was Done upon Him\": Rites of Personage in Foxe's Book of Martyrs",
      "abstract": "KING LEAR NOTORIOUSLY MAKES case that to be naked, unadorned, or unaccommodated is, literally, to not-be; like unreal number zero, such a is O without a figure.(1) Though this logic arguably covers anybody, Lear's own case in matter of investiture is special: as king he is invested with an or dignity, period's idiom for what we might call an official capacity. This essay will consider material relations (cloth rites as well as social interactions) involved in adorning a into--or out of--being.(2) In particular, it will assess early modern formulations of what we still term figures.(3) The person (often sense of term the great) maintains a juridical status apart from private persons. So instead of primarily viewing a public/private split as occurring within a single self, early modern English culture seems largely to understand it as separating categorically different forms of personage. Aemilia Lanyer, for example, construed the great as those who placed in ... Orbes of State, apart from others who might wish to be near them; Francis Bacon devoted an essay entitled Of Great Place to this status or class.(4) Public personage enjoys, of course, a special relation to clothing and costuming. In Twelfth Night, when Malvolio believes in his own sudden, apparent access to (some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em), he determines both to adopt fashions of going yellow-stockinged and cross-gartered and to spout arguments of state and read politic authors (3.1. 138, 148). Greatness, like clothes, is put in Malvolio's account. Ceremonies of investiture often establish an individual with marks of place. But it is not simply a matter of wearing the robes of office--we also see a fascination with social interactions that transfer robes and with their status as borrowed attire. Shakespearean examples abound and emphasize office-holding as temporary possession of a loaned garment. Lear himself compounds his divestiture of royal estate with Off, off, you lendings / Come, unbutton here (3.4.103); Duke in Measure for Measure, deputing powers to his substitute, has lent him our terror [severity], dressed him with our love [mercy] (1.1.19). Against our quotidian sense of dressing oneself, in one's own clothes, what does it mean to be formally dressed in or stripped of borrowed clothes--by someone else? Instead of reviewing an instance of political divestiture, I propose to assess an episode in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs: degrading of Nicolas Ridley and executions of Ridley and Hugh Latimer on same day in 1555 under Marian prosecution of Protestants. Foxe's narration of these cases provides special interest for three reasons. Ridley's divestiture(5) reflects originally ecclesiastical jurisprudence underlying the king's two bodies theory of relation between a mortal and perpetual office, a decretal known as Quoniam abbas.(6) But unlike this relatively esoteric legal rule, incident was public and theatrical; its dissemination in Foxe's martyrology further established story in, at once, both popular and national culture.(7) Perhaps most interestingly, though, we see ceremony of divestiture juxtaposed with other strategies and semiotics of dress. Specifically, Foxe's text stages a powerful, though ultimately incomplete, contestation of power of clothes either to confer or cancel personage. Against a doctrine of institutional and legal office materially effected by rites of dress, Foxe sets a Protestant semiotic of (only virtual) nakedness as a competing theory of relation of clothes to persons. But either way, personage is specified through events that are physically interactive and that depend on cloth transactions. Foxe's prose, like George Cavendish's Life of Wolsey or Edward Hall's History of Noble Houses of Lancaster and York, records an inventorying fabric sense that immediately notifies modern reader of poverty of his or her vocabularies for cloth. …",

      "title": "Patient Moral Relativism in the Zhuangzi Defended: A Reply to Jianping Hu",
      "abstract": "Patient Moral Relativism in the Zhuangzi Defended: A Reply to Jianping Hu Yong Huang (bio) I have been developing an ethics that I initially identified in the text of the Zhuangzi and which I have characterized in different ways under different names. First, in contrast to the moral Golden (and Silver) Rule, which asks us to do (or not do) unto others as we would (or would not) like to have done unto us, I call it the moral Copper Rule: do (or do not do) unto others as they would (or would not) like to have done unto them (see Huang 2005). Second, in contrast to the ethics of commonality, I call it ethics of difference. Ethics of Commonality is a general term I use to include the [End Page 472] moral Golden Rule, Kantian ethics (including Kantian revisions of the Golden Rule), and even Rorty’s anti-Kantian ethics, according to which an action that is right for one person in one situation must also be right for anyone else in the same situation and for the same person in any other situation. Unlike it, ethics of difference enjoins moral agents to pay attention to relevant differences both between themselves (as agents) and the recipients of their actions and among different recipients of their actions (see Huang 2010a). Third, in contrast to agent moral relativism, according to which the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined according to the standard of the agent (or agent’s group), and appraiser relativism, according to which the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the standard of the appraiser (or appraiser’s group), I call it patient relativism, according to which the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the standard of the patient (not that of the patient’s group) who receives the action (see Huang 2014, 2018). I have argued that Zhuangzian ethics, which under these different names essentially means the same thing, is superior to its alternatives, mentioned above. So it is interesting to read the comment by Jianping Hu, who disagrees with me on both the merits of such an ethics and its claimed source in the Zhuangzi. I am happy to make brief responses on both accounts, and since she uses the term I have used in my most recent papers on the topic, “patient relativism,” from this point on I shall use this term to describe this type of Zhuangzian ethics (though the other two terms essentially mean the same thing). Before I proceed to respond to Hu, however, I would like to start by making two initial points, one related to the Zhuangzi and the other related to patient relativism, both of which are relevant to Hu’s criticism and my responses to them. The first point is related to the Zhuangzi. The Zhuangzi is full of stories involving different species of animals, mainly from which, indeed, I have detected the Zhuangzian patient relativism. There are scholars who argue that Zhuangzi was perhaps one of the earliest philosophers to advocate animal rights, with which I disagree. In my view, by showing how we humans should treat or interact with other species of animals, the Zhuangzi is primarily trying to tell us how we human beings should treat each other and not how we human beings should treat other animals. In a famous passage in the second chapter, “On the Equality of Things,” Zhuangzi first shows that what counts as the best place to live, the best food to eat, and the best beauty to appreciate is different for different species of animals, and then immediately concludes that “from my point of view, the principles of benevolence and rightness and the paths of right and wrong are so confused and mixed up that there is no way to tell!” (Zhuangzi 2:93). Clearly this is a reference to Confucianism and Mohism, both of which advocate universal principles for dealing with human relationships. In chapter 8, “Webbed Toes,” there is a passage that first states that what is long should not be [End Page 473] considered superfluous and what is short should not be considered insufficient. Thus, although a duck’s...",

      "abstract": "If we understand death as the irreversible loss of the good life, we can give meaning to the idea that for suffering patients in the end stage of their illness, life may become an evil and death no longer a threat. Life may lose its good already in the living person. But what does the good of life consist in, then? I defend an internalist view according to which the goodness of life is intrinsically related to the attitudes, concerns, interests and experiences of the person who is leading the life. This results in the contention that the core of what we understand as the value of the person's life is to be identified with what makes life go well for the person living the particular life. This internalist view does not presuppose (or imply) hedonism or mentalism, nor does it pose an experience requirement. Something may be good for you, because it is valuable as seen from your authentic viewpoint, even if you do not actually experience this goodness, or think otherwise because you are mistaken about your own well-being. To test this position, and the authenticity-requirement it includes, I discuss three cases of patients who are persistent in denying that in their life any value is left and who contend that death is not worse than further living. Internalism acknowledges that in the life of these patients there may be 'functionings' and 'beings' that are worthwhile, where the test of value is at least partially independent of subjective assessment. Still, internalism claims that something truly valuable can only contribute to the good of one's life of it has positive meaning as seen from the attitudinal viewpoint that identifies oneself.",

(2) Material trajectories in nature are unique, but acts in history are open to multiple interpretations. (3) In terms of set theory, history is bigger than nature. (4) Historical acts cannot be demarcated from the rest of the world by interactions with the world at a boundary. What happens far off-stage can transform human acts in focal view. (5) Human acts can be revised after the fact. Material trajectories in nature cannot be. (6) Meaning and interpretation are constitutive of human acts. (7) Human acts may involve physical motions; they do not always do so. (8) Human acts always involve final causes. (9) Efficient causes in nature determine their effects; efficient causes in history may not.",

      "title": "Animals, in Zoroastrianism",
      "abstract": "Abstract In Zoroastrianism the entire creation is divided into two main groups belonging to the opposing powers of good and evil. The world in which we live is a mixture of these two powers which not only determine the lives of humans, but also control that of animals. The “beneficent animals” (Avestan: gao.spəṇta‐ ; Middle Persian: gōspand ) are the creatures of the Good Spirit/Ohrmazd and the “evil animals” (Avestan: xrafstra‐ ; Middle Persian: xrafstar ) are the creatures of the Evil Spirit/Ahriman. Beneficent animals (cattle, dogs, and other domestic animals) all play important roles in promoting human welfare; they can be tamed, eaten, or sacrificed to the deities. Opposed to them are evil animals (frogs, scorpions, lizards, and snakes) which are potentially harmful to human beings and their agricultural crops or else hideous and obnoxious in aspect; they are regarded as inedible and unsuitable as sacrificial offerings. Eliminating the evil animals was regarded as a highly meritorious deed for Zoroastrians and could be part of atonement for various sins and purification rituals.",

      "title": "《格林童話》中有關「禁令」故事之分析",
      "abstract": "Forbiddance has been closely related to our life. Additionally, forbiddance has a contradicting and complicated relationship with human nature, awaiting our exploration and explanation. From a psycho-analytic perspective, this thesis investigated the implicit meanings of those Green’s fairy tales that are related to forbiddance in terms of three aspects — human nature, symbolic meanings, and role analysis. It is expected that information on this thesis will contribute to future research and teaching. I. Human nature 1. Curiosity Those forbiddance-related fairy tales do not seem to encourage “over curiosity” and “behaviors out of curiosity” of children. The stories tend to suppress and confine the curiosity nature, with the purpose of reminding child readers that they should control and resist the temptation of curiosity; driven by curiosity would result in unexpected danger and disaster. 2. Gluttony Those stories show that indulging in eating often leads to negligence, and even the danger of losing one’s life. On the other hand, the stories imply the importance of choosing food as edible or not, and as should- or should-not-be-eaten, because indulging in eating without thinking or restraining often ends up doing harm to oneself. 3. Greed Many forbiddance-related fairy tales are about the greedy nature of using various unfair and ruthless means to gain wealth, warning people that greed will lead to distressing result. In addition, the greed depicted in the fairy tales involves not only greed for wealth, but also the dissatisfaction at one’s status and avid pursuit of social position. II. Symbolic meanings 1. Sex Stories with sexual hint usually do not focus on the sex itself, but instead on the discussion of issues of early sexual behavior and over curiosity to sex. When the fairy tales deal with this type of information, they use symbolic, implicit way to convey information, allowing the sexual hint to be understood when children grow up with a ready mind and body. 2. Death It happens a lot in fairy tales that one is not allowed to speak. According to Freud’s analysis of dream, cannot-speak or dumb represents death. Death in fairy tales is a psudo-phenomenon and is followed by awakening and reliving. Reliving and resurrection represent that they acquire wisdom and growth through the static waiting process, as well as that human beings will never surrender to death. 3. Violence and cruelty The criticism of cruelty on Green’s fairy tales in fact overlooked the barbarous part of human nature and the previous human history. Another important reason is that we neglect the characteristics of spoken fairy tales and influence of storybook illustrations. As fairy tales cannot go without human nature, the description of barbarous human nature is inevitable. The terrible scenarios in the stories mean to teach us to avoid the defects, overcome the weakness, and further exert the goodness of human nature. III. Role analysis 1. Witch Analysis of “forbiddance” stories found that the role of witches or stepmothers is negative and evil. The stories tend to uglify or emphasize the negative side of stepmothers and neglect their good side, which may be unfair for nice and merciful stepmothers in real life. 2. Elder people The role of elder people in the fairy tales is usually ignored or depreciated as background figures, suggesting that the elder people’s roles are function-oriented and thus they disappeared after they had achieved their functions. Such simplification and disregard of elder people may have profound influence on child readers by causing them to look down upon the elderly. 3. Youngest child Even though there are occasionally some negative descriptions, the role played by the youngest child is usually to save, which seems to be very different from the general impression of fighting between brothers or envying between sisters. Those stories tend to focus on the youngest child and place little emphasis on other brothers and sisters, who become the background, and sometimes negative, figures to contrast the youngest child. This may have negative influence on the self-concept and self-recognition of sisters and brothers in real life. This thesis finally summarized the aforementioned results and findings to draw conclusions. It is expected that this thesis will provide suggestions and recommendations to help parents, educators, writers and publishers of storybooks, educational organizations, and future researchers.",

But he can seldom escape from himself. He is so severely self-imprisoned. His life faces the stalemate condition. He realizes that his days are numbered. He hears the foot steps of death. Hallucination haunts him at that wretched mental condition. Thus born free man is chained. No force can free him from such captivity. Only repentance caused by sense of guilt can rescue him.

Each such ‘social generation’ was tested with the same two toys. Initially both objects were avoided or approached with caution.

This logic sought to abolish interiority's multiplicities and to render the subject more strictly unified and calculating, a subject stripped of otherwise inextricable ties to its \"other\" (both within and beyond the subject) for whom penance is performed. The Form argues that extreme ascesis did not necessarily entail a reduction of the self to an exterior presence and fullness, nor did it inevitably assimilate the ritually exteriorized subject to its social engagements and towards an abolishment of the inner life. Yet penitential practices often lead to an exploitation of the body in these terms and do so through a disavowal of fragility — a fragility that for Rolle was essential to and constitutive of the contemplative subject.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the significance of Egyptian wall scenes, whether they depict stereotyped themes or specific individuals and events.The representation of human figures in Egyptian art was governed by wellknown strict canons of proportion and perspective, which resulted in most figures looking similar and necessitated the addition of accompanying inscriptions to identify them.Such identification however demonstrates the artist's intention to draw specific individuals.A careful examination of these scenes demonstrates that the artist was observant of the physical differences of the people he represented, whether these were the result of race, birth defect, disease, or accident.Variations in the skin colour, hair type and style, shape of the beard and nose, colour of the eyes were observed, and so were body shape, with some shown as emaciated, dwarves, suffering severe in-toeing, hunched-up shoulders, or even blindness.Sudden physical effort required in certain professions resulted in hernias, and both umbilical hernias and scrotal hernias appear in wall scenes.Physical deformities, perhaps the result of accidents or diseases, such as polio, are represented in some scenes, while living on the banks of a river rich in dangerous aquatic animals no doubt resulted in accidents, as is commemorated in the tomb of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hassan in the case of a man who lost the lower part of his leg.These examples which were depicted side-by-side with other more typical scenes strongly demonstrate the specificity of Egyptian wall scenes, despite the restrictive canons.",

Or, if you prefer, superstition is that sort of enchantment or magical power which fear exercises over our soul; the wretched daughter of the imagination, who attacks it with ghosts, dreams, and visions […] It crushes the mind, mainly with illness or adversity; it transforms good discipline & venerable customs into mummery & superficial ceremonies. Once it has put down deep roots in whatever religion it might be, good or bad, it is capable of extinguishing natural enlightenment ( les lumières naturelles ), & of troubling the soundest minds. In short, this is humanity's most terrible scourge. Even atheism destroys no natural sentiments, casts no slur on the laws, or on popular morals; but superstition is a despotic tyrant who makes everything surrender to its flights of fancy. Its prejudices are superior to all other prejudices. An atheist has an interest in the public tranquillity through a love of his own peace of mind; but fanatical superstition , born of a troubled imagination, overthrows empires […] Ignorance and barbarity usher in superstition , hypocrisy maintains it with useless ceremonies, false zeal propagates it, & self-interest perpetuates it. The hand of the monarch is unsure how to put the monster of superstition in chains, & it is from this monster, still more than from irreligion (inexcusable as it is) that the throne should fear for its authority […] Superstition , put into action, properly constitutes fanaticism, see FANATICISM; this is one of the finest and best articles in the Encyclopédie .

      "abstract": "Personality is a difficult concept to define: it is ex­tremely hard to encapsulate what makes a person ‘who they are’ in general terms. Personality is typically thought of as the set of characteristics which make us think, feel, and act in our own unique way. Personality is pervasive; people tend to behave in similar ways throughout life and across differing social and inter­personal contexts. The characteristics of personality, called traits, are a set of common features which are observed in variable degrees in different people. Traits provide a useful structure in which to describe a per­sonality: Box 31.1 shows some common personality traits. Some traits may be perceived as an asset to the individual, while others are more of a nuisance. We all have a little more or a little less of any given trait. The word ‘temperament’ rather than personality is used to describe the behavioural characteristics dis­played by young children. This is because our person­ality takes time to develop; it is shaped by a multitude of environmental, biological, and factors which interact throughout early life. By our late teens or early twenties, the majority of individuals have the set of traits which define the personality we will have for the rest of our lives. Having an understanding of an individual’s per­sonality helps clinicians to predict their patients’ re­sponse to illness and its treatment. The majority of us have some less favourable aspects to our personality, but we work around them and/ or have more prominent favourable traits that allow us to get on with our lives. For a minority of people, their less favourable traits are so prominent that they cause problems for themselves or for those around them. It is these people who we think of as having a personality disorder. It is extremely difficult to draw a line between normal personality and personality disorder, so this simple pragmatic approach is helpful in clinical practice. People with a personality disorder may: … ● have difficulties with social situations and relationships; ● have difficulties controlling their feelings and/ or behaviour; ● react in unusual ways to illness or to treatment; ● behave in unusual ways when mentally ill; ● have more extreme or unusual reactions to stressful events; ● behave in ways that are detrimental to themselves or others ● be more prone to developing other types of mental disorder.",

      "abstract": "More than a century ago European observers began to describe an odd Malayan' malady known in the vernacular as latah. Upon provocation, usually involving a shock or acute fright, a latah person would shout an obscene utterance, imitate a word, gesture, or action, or automatically obey commands that he/she would not normally follow. Such reactions made a vivid impression upon the Europeans who witnessed them, partly because they involved a loss of self-control that was quite uncharacteristic of peoples who placed great emphasis upon decorum, equilibrium, and personal dignity. These observers also quickly became aware of certain other things about latah. It was apparently widespread among Malayan peoples, but affected only certain individuals. It was well known to the natives themselves, but they regarded it as a personal quirk rather than a form of insanity. What brought it on? Was it inherited or acquired? Was a narcotic substance of some sort involved? Or the tropical climate? And just what was latah anyway?--an odd form of hypnosis? hysteria? trance? Was it dangerous to others? Was it, for example, related somehow to that other well-known Malay practice of running amok? Was it curable? It was certainly not something that could be readily explained by reference to anything in an Englishman's or a Dutchman's own cultural system of psychiatric knowledge or experience, whether folk or medical.",

The word \"nature\" has three primary, interrelated meanings: (1) the intrinsic properties or essence of things or processes; (2) an inherent force that directs or determines the world; and (3) the material world or universe, the object of our sense perceptions—both in its entirety and variously understood as including or excluding God, spirit, mind, human beings, society, history, culture, etc.Click here to purchase a PDF version of this article at the Monthly Review website.",

      "abstract": "I am, of course, aware that infanticide was accepted and practiced in ancient Greece and Rome, and is still practiced (usually secretly, with winks and nods from public authorities, and with guilty denials by those who perform the killings and those officials who tolerate and sometimes even encourage them) in places like India and China today; just as I am aware that slavery was accepted and practiced in ancient Greece and Rome (and in the American south until 1865), and is still practiced in some places (eg, Mauritania) today. But if philosophers, no matter how sophisticated, were to step forward today to argue that slavery is morally acceptable (eg, because some people would have better lives as slaves than the lives they will lead in circumstances of freedom—you can easily imagine how a clever argument might be constructed), I would call that madness.\n\nOf course, the ‘madness’ I am referring to in condemning the advocacy of infanticide and slavery or their moral permissibility is moral madness. I am not making a clinical diagnosis of a psychiatric condition. I take it that this was obvious, but that Charles Camosy is nevertheless troubled that I would say such a thing. But I do say it. And at the risk of giving offense, I will say it again: advocating the moral permissibility of killing healthy newborn infants is moral madness; and it is scandalous, especially in a journal (the Journal of Medical Ethics ) expressly directed not merely to philosophers (who—and I confess to being one—enjoy playing with every manner of shocking idea) but to physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals—people whose attitudes shape decisions they make about the lives of real people, including real infants.\n\nWhatever errors of fact and judgment are made possible by the complexities of human development or a prenatal …",

      "title": "Semantics and Metaphysics in Gilbert of Poitiers",
      "abstract": "Abstract Each inhabitant of our world Gilbert calls (following Boethius) an id quod est or subsistens. Its main constituents are the subsistentiae (or the subsistent's id quo which is sometimes taken collectively to stand for ea quibus) and these are accompanied by the 'accidents', quantity and quality. The subsistent owes its status (or transitory condition) to a collection of inferior members of the Aristotelian class of accidents, which to Gilbert's mind are rather 'accessories' or 'attachments from without' (extrinsecus affixa). The term 'substantia' is used both to stand for substance and substantial form (subsistentia), i.e., that by which something is subsistent (or 'is a substance'). The collection of subsistentiae (substantial forms) or the forma totius is called natura. However, 'natura' is also used to stand for either just one subsistentia or all the forms found in a subsistens even including its 'accidental' forms (quantity and quality). The inclusion of all kinds of accidents (including those inferior ones that make up a thing's status) is seldom found in the intension of the word 'natura'. One of the key notions featuring in Gilbert's ontology is esse aliquid. 'To be a-something' has a threefold import. First, it means 'to be only some thing', and to miss perfection. Second, it has the positive sense of 'being a something', i.e. 'being determinate and well-delineated', not indefinite, not formless that is. Third, 'to be a something' implies concreteness, corporealness and singularity.",

      "abstract": "3.1. Key aspects of the term Evolution Unfortunately, clear definition of the term evolution is missing. According to Lehman and Ramil (chapter 1 of [1]), the term evolution reflects a process of progressive, for example beneficial, change in the attributes of the evolving entity or that of one or more of its constituent elements. What is accepted as progressive must be determined in each context. It is also appropriate to apply the term evolution when long-term change trends are beneficial even though isolated or short sequences of changes may appear degenerative. For example, an entity or collection of entities may be said to be evolving if their value or fitness is increasing over time. Individually or collectively they are becoming more meaningful, more complete or more adapted to changing environment. Our understanding of the term related to the workshop theme covers the following key aspects: • Modification, change, progress, extension over time • State of an artefact at different points of time • Models change: dynamic versus static • Evolution versus revolution while revolution means the replacement of an existing system by new one",

Their unrelation, their denial to relate to certain things is transposed onto people who do touch these things; perhaps superimposed is a better verb to describe the phenomenon. This is quite clearly, again, an operation of metonymy, with a sort of inmixing of the two basic kinds: invariable concomitance and cause-effect. Those who do not touch animal fat, skin, human waste, and so on will not touch people who do precisely that, because of their frequent contact with these things. Thus, regulations on touching things were transposed onto people. There are actually two processes: the thingification of humans and the humanization of things. These two processes enhance and extend and confuse regulations on touching and being touched by people and things.",

What allows the earth to become an appropriable object is a prior inappropriable and unobjectifiable element. The unobjectifiable expanse of desert, sea or sky is what allows objective, appropriable nature to appear: “The desert, sky, or sea, the Ocean, the Unlimited, first plays the role of an encompassing element, and tends to become a horizon: the earth is thus surrounded, globalized, ‘grounded’ by this element, which holds it in immobile equilibrium and makes Form possible” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 495). The appropriable “object form” is imposed on the desertified surface of this formless and inappropriable element, which is constantly “eluding” or “fleeing” appropriation. The geologic and organic formalisation or “stratification” of the earth is a kind of “imprisonment” (40). Geotraumatic suffering thus inheres in the resistance or antagonism between this appropriating form, which renders material in terms of objectified substances, and a formless or unlimited materiality.",

      "abstract": "Although there is extensive literature on bereavement after the loss of pets, it has almost exclusively focused on traditional pets, such as cats and dogs, to the exclusion of many other species that are also popular pets. We targeted caregivers of less-traditional pets, such as reptiles, birds, fish, and exotics, to assess their experiences when grieving their loss. Specifically, we examined the manner in which they reported the loss and the degree of perceived support they received from close and more distant associates as well as their grief over the loss. We surveyed 464 pet owners, 337 of whom reported the loss of a pet other than a cat or dog. We examined whether their experiences of grief, sharing loss, and receiving support differed from those of cat and dog owners. We also assessed the role of the pet (i.e., as companion or other), whether they were housed in an enclosure, concerns about the pet, and problem behaviors as predictors, with the owner's attachment to the pet as a mediator. Pet role, enclosure, and attachment significantly predicted grief. Overall, attachment was a better predictor than pet type for grief, reporting of the loss, and perceived support from others. These findings suggest that owners experience grief similarly for traditional and nontraditional pets as long as they feel bonded to their pets.",

      "abstract": "The aesthetic appearance of beauty is intertwined with the experience of looking: and this opens up exciting paths for us to explore within the space of the complex dimensions of learning. The act of “taking something of beauty” (or something related to beauty, including its opposites) is driven by curiosity and desire but accompanied by a sense of fear and paralysis; that which attracts us may become monstruously or terribly beautiful, or – to draw on the lexicon of excess associated with beauty – “too beautiful”. There is a sort of unsustainability inherent in beauty. This text explores the dimension of envy, so understood, starting from its ethical declension, bordering with the dimension of justice; in this case, envious glance is rather a questioning look; it wonders, that's to say, how the merit of other's success happened. Envy produces questioning not as about the effects, as about processes. But often the destroying power of the envious glance reaches instead the need of an act of power (a visual one or trough the vision) of the action of other's beauty. It may be the subject of the educational relationship or the subject of learning. These declensions of the envious glance are analysed starting from literature, from myth and from the iconography connected to the power of looking.",

      "title": "How Action Shapes Body Ownership Momentarily and Throughout the Lifespan",
      "abstract": "Objects which a human agent controls by efferent activities (such as real or virtual tools) can be perceived by the agent as belonging to his or her body. This suggests that what an agent counts as “body” is plastic, depending on what she or he controls. Yet there are possible limitations for such momentary plasticity. One of these limitations is that sensations stemming from the body (e.g., proprioception) and sensations stemming from objects outside the body (e.g., vision) are not integrated if they do not sufficiently “match”. What “matches” and what does not is conceivably determined by long–term experience with the perceptual changes that body movements typically produce. Children have accumulated less sensorimotor experience than adults have. Consequently, they express higher flexibility to integrate body-internal and body-external signals, independent of their “match” as suggested by rubber hand illusion studies. However, children’s motor performance in tool use is more affected by mismatching body-internal and body-external action effects than that of adults, possibly because of less developed means to overcome such mismatches. We review research on perception-action interactions, multisensory integration, and developmental psychology to build bridges between these research fields. By doing so, we account for the flexibility of the sense of body ownership for actively controlled events and its development through ontogeny. This gives us the opportunity to validate the suggested mechanisms for generating ownership by investigating their effects in still developing and incomplete stages in children. We suggest testable predictions for future studies investigating both body ownership and motor skills throughout the lifespan.",

But unlike learning some other physical operations (those which require skill, like playing the piano, cooking, sewing, or driving a car) the notion of excellence or expertise cannot be applied unmodified to the performance of ritualized action; for ritualization itself tends to undermine the link between the purposes for which an action is performed and the form the action takes. In performing an act in ritualized form, as a ritual act, you perform it as you do, and not some other way, just because it is so prescribed, and not because it makes sense to you to do so, or because you have reasons for doing so. You have reasons only for ‘enacting the ritual’, and whatever those purposes may be, the way to ‘get it right’ as a physical act remains the same. Nevertheless, the relation between purposes and ritualized action is not altogether straightforward.",

      "abstract": "It is plausible that current generations owe something to future generations. One possibility is that we have a duty to not harm them. Another possibility is that we have a duty to protect them. In either case, however, to satisfy the duties to future generations from environmental or political degradation, we need to engage in widespread collective action. But, as we are, we have a limited ability to do so, in part because we lack the self-discipline necessary for successful collective action. Given that having an obligation hinges on being able to satisfy it, the apparent duty to future generations is at odds with our apparent inability to satisfy it. Thus, we either need to rethink our duties to future generations or rethink the nature of our abilities. I argue in this chapter that we should rethink the nature of our abilities. Specifically, we should enhance our self-discipline, which is distinct from enhancements of motivation, judgment, or emotion. Even the most intelligent, motivated, and empathetic actor is likely to slip up, which encourages others to withdraw their cooperation. Without the necessary self-discipline to sustain our public cooperative behavior, collective action is likely to fail, leaving us with one alternative: to abandon our duties to future generations.",

      "abstract": "What people desire most in life is freedom from anxiety, peace of mind in a trustworthy environment, and life in a spiritually rich environment. Among the basic prerequisites for peace of mind are safety and security. Threats to safety and security fall into two categories: 1) The first involves artificial, intentionally created events, typified by war. The element differentiating such events as war from disaster is the presence of intent – in this case, to kill or injure the enemy. In contrast, damage caused by unilateral violence such as terrorism – one-sided violence against innocent people having no intent to fight – is qualified as a disaster. 2) The second category involves disasters caused by natural factors and, in the case of artificially created events, an element lacking intent and unexpected from the viewpoint of the state-of-the-art, inadvertently involving good will. We are concerned here with the second rather than the first category. Typical of the first half of the second category are natural disasters. When I confronts natural disasters, I invariably encounter the cognition of a deeprooted principle, which is that Nature is beyond human elements. Despite the oft-stated saying that “Man shall impose mastery of Nature,” such a stance is far outside the envelope. Instead of such a stance, we should, if possible, make a plea to be loved by Nature, but surely this is a figment of human egoism. The best path for human beings to take is to do their utmost, seeking Nature’s understanding of our endeavors to be freed from the deadly penalties exacted by Nature. The above path limits the basic method and way of thinking against natural disasters to “disaster mitigation.” Disaster mitigation roughly falls into two approaches. The first involves the construction of new structures or the improvement of existing ones, i.e., physical defense against natural elements. The human inability to predict the future – and natural disasters – prevents us from preparing everything against the disaster with this method, viz., “God only knows.” What we can do is to prepare for potential disaster probabilistically, constructing structures that, at least temporarily, mitigate maximum disaster. The second approach involves preparation of an “observational disaster-mitigation system.” In other words, predicting potential disasters prior to their actual occurrence by applying observations and knowledge from past disasters in order to mitigate damages, or constructing and implementing a “disaster-mitigation system” using all possible measures including evacuation before actual events attack residential area. Regarding the occurrence of nonmalicious artificial events – the second category of threats to safety mentioned above – examples include the hazards caused by chemicals, food, and construction materials that are potentially lethal to those exposed to them. Man may not be perfect, being unable to in prepare completely against such suffering. It has occurred in the past and will surely occur in the future. For such disasters and their mitigation, we must clarify their effects from the viewpoint of human studies centering on law and ethics in addition to the technological viewpoint. In the case of marketing of new products and new technology, for example, it is natural that inspection from different angles should be made, and that doubled and tripled efforts be taken to avoid fatal damage such as loss of human life. Behind this, persons concerned must be aware that human beings – small existence compared to Nature – enter unknown world tremblingly. It is excellent to inaugurate the accumulation of knowledge on disasters from as wide a viewpoint as possible, not restricting action to natural disasters alone. I express congratulations from my heart and look forward to reading many contributions on advanced achievements that may lead to peace of mind for people potentially affected by disasters and their mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Biological definitions tend to locate intelligence in evolutionary terms where the higher species are seen to be more adaptable and versatile than the lower species. Conceptions of intelligence have largely been appropriated by schools as tools by which to select and grade both pupils and materials. Intelligence, it has been argued, may be defined in terms of good performance in the official school curriculum or in terms of an ability to 'mess' or 'have a laugh'. Intelligence becomes defined in terms of 'knowing how to handle oneself under a variety of circumstances. One who knows how to 'handle' his or herself may be called 'smart' or 'street-wise' in one social set, 'brilliant' or 'sparkling' in another. The denial of opportunity through the unequal distribution of the fruits of social labour violates an individual's sense of moral order and also the individual's intelligence.",

      "title": "Patriotism in the Age of Investors",
      "abstract": "Patriotism is to a nation what egotism is to a person. One has a passionate attachment to one’s idea of oneself, believes virtues arise from that passion, and seeks to act consistently with those imagined virtues. Patriotism is a similarly complex concept that presumes the same three kinds of things have a necessary relationship and together form a unique totality. A passion, love of one's country, is held to produce a virtue, a consistent commitment to an ideal image of one’s country, which in turn produces a pattern of actions, often self-sacrificial, intended to benefit one’s country. Many might feel the passion, but those who most attest to it may not feel it most. Many might give evidence of the virtue, or seek to, but those considered most exemplary may not possess it most securely. Many might act to benefit their countries, but what counts as a benefit, whether an action is to be judged by its intentions or its effects, who is to judge, and by what means are all issues contentious in proportion to the extremity of the circumstances that prompt the action and the drama of the deed. The complexity of the concept cannot be avoided. Conventional use of the word “patriotism” assumes that the action is founded on virtue and that the virtue necessarily arises from the passion, so that if one has the passion, one will have the virtue, and if one has the virtue, one will perform deeds of actual bene.t to one’s country. This complexity of these covertly asserted assumptions makes the concept intrinsically ideological.",

      "abstract": "People often think that something must have a mind to be part of a moral interaction. However, the present research suggests that minds do not create morality but that morality creates minds. In four experiments, we found that observing intentional harm to an unconscious entity--a vegetative patient, a robot, or a corpse--leads to augmented attribution of mind to that entity. A fifth experiment reconciled these results with extant research on dehumanization by showing that observing the victimization of conscious entities leads to reduced attribution of mind to those entities. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the effects of victimization vary according to victims' preexisting mental status and that people often make an intuitive cognitive error when unconscious entities are placed in harm's way. People assume that if apparent moral harm occurs, then there must be someone there to experience that harm-a harm-made mind. These findings have implications for political policies concerning right-to-life issues.",

      "title": "Pride and Identity",
      "abstract": "Abstract How is it that pride has gone from being one of the traditional seven deadly sins to becoming, in recent decades, the banner under which social movements have declared their objectives (Black Pride, Gay Pride, and so on)? How are we to understand the shift from a theology of sin to a politics of self-assertion (and an accompanying psychology of self-esteem)? Is it simply that times have changed? That, God having died, attitudes have changed—so that what once was thought to precede a fall now seems a condition of rising? Or is it perhaps that the nature of pride is to be understood differently in the two contexts? There may be an inherent ambiguity in pride: associating it on the one hand with arrogance, conceit, egotism, and vanity, and on the other hand with self-respect, self-esteem, self-confidence, dignity. (On certain readings, these may all be seen as different kinds or degrees of self-love.) Thus at different times, different aspects of the nature of the emotion come to be given prominence. Or is the difference in the objects? One place to start is with the recognition that the object, and the subject, of the traditional sin was the individual. The social movements that argue for pride are concerned with groups. How do individual and group identity come together in pride?",

      "title": "Something Happened on the Way to the ©",
      "abstract": "Intellectual property. It's a strange term, indicating from its structure that the questionable notion of property has been appended to something that, in a tangible sense, doesn't even exist. Difficult to grasp, like water, or air, yet at the same time so desirable to own... In Anglo-American law, property is defined, as the eighteenth-century jurist Sir William Blackstone put it, as \"that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe\" (Terry &amp; Guigni 207). For most physical things, the 'right' of exclusion seems simple enough to understand, and to control. Yet even there, when the boundaries blur, especially over space and time, the results of such 'rights' become less and less manageable, as indicated by the classic 'tragedy of the commons' (Hardin). And once we move outside of the physical realm, and into the world of ideas, or of feelings or the spirit, the notion of an exclusive 'right' of ownership steadily makes less and less sense. It's an issue that's come to the fore with the rise of the Open Source movement, creating software that can be freely shared and used by anyone. There are many arguments about exactly is meant by 'free', though there's often an emphasis on freedom of ideas rather than price: \"think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer'\" is how one group describes it (Free Software Foundation). Unlike proprietary software such as Microsoft Windows, the source-code from which the programs are compiled is available is available for anyone to view, amend, extend. As yet, few programmers are paid to do so; certainly no-one is excluded from doing so. The results from this apparently anarchic and altruistic model would be startling for anyone coming from a conventional economics background: for example, Sourceforge, the main Open Source repository, currently hosts almost 60,000 projects, with almost ten times that number of active contributors (Sourceforge). Some of these projects are huge: for example, the Linux kernel is well over a million lines of code, whilst the Gnome user-interface is already almost twice that size. Open Source programs such as the 'LAMP' quadrivirate of the GNU/Linux operating-system, Apache web-server, MySQL database and PHP, Perl or Python scripting languages provide most of the software infrastructure for the Internet (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl, Python). And the Internet returns the favour, by providing a space in which collaboration can happen quickly and for the most part transparently, without much regard for status or location. Yet central though the Internet may be to this new wave of shared 'public good', the core innovations of Open Source are more social than technological. Of these, probably the most important are a specific kind of collaboration, and an unusual twist on copyright law. Eric Raymond's classic essay 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' is one of the best descriptions of the social processes behind Open Source (Raymond). \"Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch\", says Raymond: see a need, tackle it, share the initial results, ask for help. Larry Wall, the initiator of Perl, \"wanted to create something that was so useful that it would be taken up by many people\" (Moody 133), and consciously promoted it in much the same way as a missionary (Moody 131). Open access to communications and a culture of shared learning provides the space to \"release early, release often\" and invite collaboration. Some projects, such as Apache and PHP, are run as a kind of distributed collective, but many are somewhat hierarchical, with a well-known lead-figure at the centre: Linus Torvalds for Linux, Larry Wall for Perl, Guido van Rossum for Python, Miguel de Icaza for Gnome. Yet the style rarely seems hierarchical in practice: the lead-figure's role is that of coordinator and final arbiter of quality, far removed from the militaristic 'command and control' so common in business environments. What makes it work is that anyone can join in, identify a bug, submit a patch, volunteer to design some desirable function or feature, and gain personal satisfaction and social respect for doing so. Programmers’ motivations vary enormously, of course: some share their work as a kind of libertarian statement, whilst others are more driven by a sense of obligation to others in the software-development community, or in the wider world. Yet for many, perhaps most, it's the personal satisfaction that's most important: as Linus Torvalds comments, \"most of the good programmers do [Open Source] programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program\" (Torvalds &amp; Ghosh). In that sense it more closely resembles a kind of art-form rather than a conventional business proposition. Realistically, many of the smaller Open Source projects are little more than student exercises, with limited real-world usefulness. But for larger, more relevant projects this borderless, inclusive collaboration usually results in code of very high quality and reliability – \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\" is another of Raymond's aphorisms – in stark contrast to the notorious security holes and general fragility of proprietary products from Redmond and elsewhere. And it leverages different people's skills to create an extraordinary degree of 'win/win', as Linus Torvalds points out: \"imagine ten people putting in one hour each every day on the project. They put in one hour of work, but because they share the end results they get nine hours of 'other peoples work' for free. It sounds unfair: get nine hours of work for doing one hour. But it obviously is not\" (Torvalds &amp; Ghosh). It's this kind of return-on-investment that's making many businesses more than willing to embrace the 'insanity' of paying programmers to give away their time on Open Source projects (Pavlicek). The hard part, for many businesses, is that it demands a very different approach to business relationships. \"Forget business as usual\", writes Russell Pavlicek; \"forget about demanding your own way; forget fluffy, empty management speeches; forget about fudging facts; forget about marketing that alienates the community; forget about pushing hype rather than real value; forget about taking more than you give\" (Pavlicek 131-7). When everything is open, and everyone is in effect a volunteer, none of those time-dishonoured tactics works well. But the real catch is the legal framework under which Open Source is developed and distributed. Conventionally, placing work in the public domain – the intellectual-property equivalent of the commons – means that anyone can apply even the minutest of changes and then declare it exclusively as their own. Walt Disney famously did exactly this with many classics, such as the Grimms' fairy-tales or Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. The Free Software Foundation's 'GNU Public License' – used for most Open Source software – avoids this by copyrighting the work, permitting freedom to view, amend and extend the code for any purpose, but requiring that any new version permit the same freedoms (GNU/FSF). This inclusive approach – nicknamed 'copyleft' in contrast to conventional copyright – turns the usual exclusive model of intellectual property on its head. Its viral, self-propagating nature uses the law to challenge the law of property: everything it touches is – in principle – freed from exclusive private ownership. Larry Lessig and the Creative Commons legal team have extended this somewhat further, with machine-readable licenses that permit a finer granularity of choice in defining what uses of a work – a musical performance, a book or a Weblog, for example – are open or withheld (Creative Commons). But the central theme is that copyleft, together with the open nature of the Internet, \"moves everything that touches it toward the public domain\" (Norlin). Which is not a happy thought for those whose business models depend on exclusion and control of access to intellectual property – such as Hollywood, the media and the biotechnology industry – nor, for that matter, for those who'd prefer to keep their secrets secret (AWOLBush). Part of the problem, for such people, is a mistaken notion of what the Internet really is. It's not a pipe or a medium, like cable TV; it's more like a space or a place, a 'world of ends' (Searls &amp; Weinberger). Not so much infrastructure, to be bought and sold, but necessarily shared, it's more 'innerstructure', a kind of artificial force of nature: \"like the Earth's fertile surface, it derives much of its fertility from the life it supports\" (Searls). Its key characteristics, argues Doc Searls, are that \"No-one owns it; Everyone can use it; Anyone can improve it\". And these characteristics of the Internet ultimately arise not from the hardware – routers, cables, servers and the like – or even the software, but ultimately from an agreement – the Internet Protocol – and an idea – that network connections can and should be self-routing, beyond direct control. Yet perhaps the most important idea that arises from this is that one of the most basic foundation-stones of Western society – the model of property as an exclusive 'right', a \"sole and despotic dominion\" – simply doesn't work. This is especially true for supposed 'intellectual property', such as copyrights, trade-marks, patents, genome sequences, scientific theories: after all, from where do those ideas and patterns ultimately arise? Who owns that? In legal terms, there's no definable root for a trail of provenance, no means to identify all involved intermediaries, and hence no ultimate anchor for any kind of property claim. Many other types of intellectual property, such as domain-names, phrases, words, radio-frequencies, colours, sounds - the word 'Yes', the phrase 'The Real Thing', Ferrari red, the sound of a Harley-Davidson – can only be described as arbitrary expropriations from the public domain. In many senses, then, the whole legal edifice of intellectual property is little more than \"all smoke and mirrors\", held together by lawyers' bluff – hardly a stable foundation for the much-vaunted 'information economy'! Whilst it's not quite true that \"nobody owns it\", in practice the only viable ownership for any kind of intellectual property would seem to be that of a declaration of responsibility, of stewardship – such as a project-leader's responsibility for an Open Source project – rather than an arbitrary and ultimately indefensible assertion of exclusive 'right'. So a simple question about intellectual property – is it copyright or copyleft? should source-code be proprietary or 'free'? – goes deeper and deeper into the 'innerstructure' of society itself. Miguel Icaza describes this well: \"as the years pass and you're working in this framework, you start to reevaluate in many areas your relationships with your friends and your family. The same ideas about free software and sharing and caring about other people start to permeate other aspects of your life\" (Moody 323). Perhaps it's time to look more carefully to look more carefully not just at intellectual property, but at the 'rights' and responsibilities associated with all kinds of property, to reach a more equitable and sustainable means to manage the tangible and intangible resources of this world we share.

      "title": "Complicated Exchanges: The Handling of Authorised and Unauthorised Gifts",
      "abstract": "The early modern idea of gift-giving primarily involved binding exchanges of a wide spectrum of objects with varying degrees of value. As a rule, a gift either resulted in a gift or favour in return, or expressed gratitude for a service rendered. A 1735 German encyclopedia by Johann Zedler explained: ‘Giving gifts and to receive something in return is thus not wrong ... [although] ... wisdom is required if one wishes one’s gifts to achieve the desired effect.’. While the fiction of altruistic gift-giving — corresponding to the courtly virtue of generosity — may have been maintained, there were distinct rules of gift-giving, attesting to a multitude of presents and occasions. By today’s definitions, such gifts could be classed as awards or rewards, bribes or payments. They ranged from private, individual presents for relatives or friends to prestigious, highly symbolic public presents. Some of these were gifts of honour (Ehrengaben), acknowledging peers or persons of higher status; others were known as ‘gifts of grace’ (Gnadengaben) and presented to those of lower rank, usually in recognition of some service or event. Then there were ceremonially regulated diplomatic gifts, donations to churches, monasteries and convents, prizes for festivals and contests, testamentary donations and so on. As the exchange of presents occurred purposefully, with a specified goal, it was subject to certain standards and ceremonies similar to those governing other courtly behaviour patterns. These rules were probably implicit; they were rarely written down. Occasionally there were infringements of rules, and these instances are especially revealing. Focusing principally on paintings, this paper considers the rules and handling of authorised and unauthorised royal gifts.Schencken also, daß uns der andere wieder was dagegen erweise, ist gar nichts unrechtes (...)

      "title": "Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Indian Culture",
      "abstract": "EVERY ADJECTIVE and noun in this title needs definition, and most if not all could be variously defined. For the purpose of this paper I shall use the following definitions, without meaning to deny the possibility of others. An idea 1 is a word or a phrase. A phrase is a group of words forming a syntactic unit; in the sense here used, it includes sentences. A dominant idea, in a people's culture, is a word or phrase which occurs, in approximately identical or semantically equivalent forms, frequently in texts of the language or languages of that people, and which appears to have been regarded by the authors of those texts, and by their cultural kinsmen and successors, as important for its bearing on human life and conduct. (In the case of living people, oral speech may take the place of texts as source material.) Definitions of culture are especially numerous and variant. I shall understand it here as meaning a total way of human life viewed as a norm, and as such approved or at least tolerated, by a people as a whole, or by its articulate representatives generally. Indian culture is the norm of human life approved or accepted generally by the civilized inhabitants of India (Hindus) since roughly round about four or five hundred B. C. Its classical expression is found in literature from about that time on, in the Sanskrit, Pali, and Prakrit languages, and later in other languages, some IndoAryan, some Dravidian (especially Tamil 2 and Telugu). It may properly be spoken of as approximately a unit in some important respects, and in most of these respects it is still the dominant cultural pattern over the greater part of India. It was however preceded by at least one earlier pattern of which we have a good deal of knowledge. I shall call this latter the Vedic culture. It was rather different from 'Indian' culture in some of these important respects. The word formation I take to mean historic origin. In short, then, I shall suppose that I am asked to pick out words and phrases which, in my opinion, have been regarded by Indians since some centuries B. C. as specially important in their bearing on the conduct of human life, viewed as a norm; and to suggest how I think they were related to earlier words and phrases, or to the same words occurring in earlier phrases and perhaps bearing different meanings. At the very outset this quest is complicated by a striking dichotomy in Indian culture. There are two radically different norms of human life and conduct, both at least tolerated, indeed in some sense accepted and approved, each in its own sphere. I shall call them the ordinary and the extraordinary norms. One strange thing is that one of them seems to involve a complete negation or rejection of the other as an acceptable norm. The first is the only one possible for the great mass of mankind, short of some future spiritual regeneration of the entire race. In this ordinary way of life, Hindu texts constantly speak of three broad aims, or aspects of the cultural norm, all of which are normal and acceptable, and which include everything that a normal man can, or at any rate ought to, aim at. These are, in Sanskrit, dharma, artha, and kIma; they are called the Group of Three, trivarga. Dharma is propriety, socially approved conduct, in relation to one's fellow men or to other living beings (animals, or superhuman powers). Law, social usage, morality, and most of what we ordinarily mean by religion, all fall under this head. Artha is profit, worldly advantage and success. It includes personal advancement in wealth, politics, business, professional and social activities of all sorts. Kdma is love: success in dealing with the opposite sex. In each of these three departments we have many extensive treatises called sastras, at the same 1 Cf. Leonard Bloomfield, Language or Ideas? in Language 12. 89-95 (1936). The title of my paper was not formulated by me; I hope my interpretations are not too far from the intent of its proponents, the Program Committee of the Centenary Meeting. 2 Some Tamil literature may be older than much which is called Classical Sanskrit.",

His candour and open manner were offensive in the eyes of ordinary people: he walked about naked (soul-naked) among the Greeks, uncovering all prejudice, just as the Divine Marquis of Sade would in an apparently very different field. Indeed, both thinkers do the same thing: they expose a real and deeply hidden tendency in men: not the desire of knowledge, but the desire of not knowing anything about their own souls. They expose what people want to keep in the dark: the certitude or the falsehood of their judgements, the limits and the pursuits of our thought. But no one can go over the limit and keep on living.",

      "title": "Ezigbo Mmadu: An Exploration of the Igbo Concept of a Good Person",
      "abstract": "The Igbo term for a good person is ezigbo mmadu. It is a term that is descriptive of good character or positive moral conduct in a person or group of persons. Among the Igbo, a person is designated as ezigbo mmadu, who possesses good conduct or moral fibre – qualities that are worthy of emulation by others. But ezigbo mmadu is not merely  descriptive of a person‟s character or conduct; it is also expressive of a person who is equable, unflappable, even-tempered and level-headed. Ezigbo mmadu has as its converse, the phrase ajo mmadu. Ajo mmadu is a term used to describe a bad man or woman, where the word ajo means „bad‟, that is, the opposite of „good‟. A person is ajo mmadu who is flawed or defective in character. With particular focus on ezigbo mmadu, the Igbo identify some special qualities of life a person must possess before he or she can be so described. In the pre-colonial setting, for example, apart from the possession of good moral conduct, a person was considered ezigbo mmadu who respected the customary laws of community and was loyal to the preternatural forces that ruled in the cosmic order. In this paper, however, it is discovered that the challenges of modernity and the harsh social environment in which the modern Igbo have found themselves seem to greatly tint their conceptualisation of who an ezigbo mmadu is. The paper does not only identify reasons for the devaluation of this once venerated concept or positive social attribute; it also proffers possible remedies to overcoming this social dilemma.",

      "title": "Updating Animal Welfare Thinking: Moving beyond the “Five Freedoms” towards “A Life Worth Living”",
      "abstract": "The Five Freedoms have had major impact on animal welfare thinking internationally. However, despite clear initial statements that the words ‘freedom from’ should indicate ‘as free as possible from’, the Freedoms have come to be represented as absolute or fundamental freedoms, even rights, by some animal advocate and other groups. Moreover, a marked increase in scientific understanding over the last two decades shows that the Freedoms do not capture the more nuanced knowledge of the biological processes that is germane to understanding animal welfare and which is now available to guide its management. For example, the named negative experiences of thirst, hunger, discomfort and pain, and others identified subsequently, including breathlessness, nausea, dizziness, debility, weakness and sickness, can never be eliminated, merely temporarily neutralised. Each one is a genetically embedded element that motivates animals to behave in particular ways to obtain specific life-sustaining resources, avoid or reduce physical harm or facilitate recovery from infection or injury. Their undoubted negativity creates a necessary sense of urgency to respond, without which animals would not survive. Also, the temporary neutralisation of these survival-critical affects does not in and of itself generate positive experience. This questions the commonly held assumption that good animal welfare will result when these internally generated negative affects are minimised. Animals may also experience other negative affects that include anxiety, fear, panic, frustration, anger, helplessness, loneliness, boredom and depression. These situation-related affects reflect animals’ perceptions of their external circumstances. Although they are elicited by threatening, cramped, barren and/or isolated conditions, they can often be replaced by positive affects when animals are kept with congenial others in spacious, stimulus-rich and safe environments which provide opportunities for them to engage in behaviours they find rewarding. These behaviours may include environment-focused exploration and food acquisition activities as well as animal-to-animal interactive activities, all of which can generate various forms of comfort, pleasure, interest, confidence and a sense of control. Animal welfare management should aim to reduce the intensity of survival-critical negative affects to tolerable levels that nevertheless still elicit the required behaviours, and should also provide opportunities for animals to behave in ways they find rewarding, noting that poor management of survival-critical affects reduces animals’ motivation to utilize such rewarding opportunities. This biologically more accurate understanding provides support for reviewing the adequacy of provisions in current codes of welfare or practice in order to ensure that animals are given greater opportunities to experience positive welfare states. The purpose is to help animals to have lives worth living, which is not possible when the predominant focus of such codes is on survival-critical measures. Finally, an updated characterisation of animal welfare that incorporates this more accurate understanding is presented.",

      "title": "Organ transplants: responsa.",
      "abstract": "Introduction In Mishna Avot our rabbis declared: “The world is supported by three things – by Torah, by service (to God) and by kindness.” “Torah,” teaching, refers to a person’s duty towards himself. A person’s first duty is to educate himself, to teach himself, to enrich himself with information that will enable him to conduct his life suitably and correctly in the best possible way, and to develop his abilities to the fullest possible extent. “Service” means that when a person has developed and grown in the way he wished and in the direction he has chosen and through his talents and his determination has, with divine help, achieved success, he should remember his Creator. He should remember that it is his Creator who has granted him his existence, his talents and abilities, his effort, his will and his energy. “Let a clever man not praise himself for his cleverness, nor a strong man praise himself for his strength (Jeremiah 9:22).” To realise that all is a divine gift is the essence of “service,” which gives value and meaning, justification and direction to personal development. The third category is “kindness.” Since all that you have, all that you have been given, is from divine kindness, you in turn are obliged to exercise kindness in the same way. A man should not live just for himself, but also for others. Whatever one is able to give to others one is obliged to give, within certain limits defined by the Torah. The concept of kindness is broad, incorporating many subconcepts. Each individual has his own talents, his own qualifications and abilities, from which he is able to donate and to help others who are in need. However, in respect to kindness the Torah sets limits which apply to duties and obligations relevant to organ transplantation.",

      "title": "That is thou — Autonomy and wholeness in creative art",
      "abstract": "All investigative, expressive and creative endeavours—cate gorised as intellectual, artistic, scientific and so on—are ultimately attempts to search, seek or to rediscover one's relationship with the cosmos and find a place in the universe. These kinds of endeavours either arise out of some presumed—a priori— socially conditioned metaphysical assumptions or out of a recreation of new metaphysical truths, perhaps, directly perceived. At some point or points in one's life these attempts gain primacy, as in 'crisis' periods, when one needs to reaffirm a harmonious relationship between the self and the world in which one lives. (The falseness or truth of the duality of 'self and the world' need not be discussed at the moment.) The self in this case may be defined as the person (with a self-image) who projects and identifies himself with other persons and other non-human existence as also, especially, with various socio-cultural concepts such as family, society, nation and so on. Individual existence implies relationships, be it with nature or humans; whether this relationship exists in the person's mind or outside, he or she cannot do without it. The word 'person, synonym for self, is deliberately used because it means 'mask' (Latin derivative—persona). This particular use of the term 'person' is different from the category of 'being', or 'human being'. In fact, even the word 'individual' is derived from the root word 'whole' or 'complete'. In this sense, the same applies to the word 'alone'—all one (not to be confused with lonely), i.e. it is derived from the root of being One without a second—referring to a total, complete individual. In turn, whole-complete is the same as holistic, implying 'one-ness'. From this flows the idea of being holy, virtuous, and that is inseparable from the notions of beauty, goodness, love and creation. The experience of all these words may only be known within",

God acts directly in that no outside causal factors cause or can influence how he acts; considerations of reason alone influence him; and hence he will always do what he believes that there is overriding reason to do, and never do what he believes that there is overriding reason not to do.",

However, cannot equate humans with animals because they have the advantage, namely reason. Ratio, talent to use language or language symbols, ability to laugh, ability to make tools, morality, character and so on are the characteristics that distinguish humans from animals. There are three concepts shown by the Qur'an when talking about humans, namely 1) al-basyar, 2) al-insan, 3). Bani Adam or Zurriyat Adam. Human position can be divided into two, namely (1). As khalifatullah fi al-ardh, (2). As 'Abdullah (servant of Allah). The first position means that humans are substitutes for God on earth. In this case, humans function as rulers and regulators on earth by applying God's laws. As servants of Allah, humans are required to worship and fulfil the function of individual human servants.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Is it possible to justify requiring that I respond adequately to the other’s vulnerability? I contend that insofar as I value my own personal identity it is consistent to respond adequately to the vulnerability of the other. Part one provides a break down of vulnerability in terms of its fundamental indeterminacy. Part two illustrates how the ability to respond either adequately or inadequately to the other’s vulnerability is implied by the fundamental co-constitution of personal identity. I understand myself as a self only insofar as I stand in relation to other selves that see me as a self. If the relationship between recognition and identity also holds for the other, my response to her vulnerability founds her identity as well. In part three the relationship developed in part two is employed to justify the obligation to respond adequately to the vulnerable other. If I value my own personal identity, then I require an adequate response from others, because that response plays an integral role in the foundation of my personal identity. The other cannot respond adequately to my vulnerability unless her own identity is assured. Only if I respond adequately to the vulnerability of the other will she be in a position to assure my identity. Therefore, I ought to respond adequately to the vulnerability of others if for no other reason than it puts the other in a position where she can assure the personal identity that I value.",

These two cases are the Lord Buddha was not complained because their mentality is covered by meditation and they got enlightenment after suicide. The suicide is morally wrong in case of a person who committed suicide because of desire. In other words, a person wants to leave this body with desire to be reborn in a better life.

Death occurs when the accumulated dam-age (wear) exceeds this initial value, modeled by the discrete or continuous random vari-ables. Another source of death of an organism is also taken into account, when it occurs as a consequence of a shock or of a demand for energy, which is a generalization of the Strehler-Mildwan’s model (1960). Biological age based on the observed degradation is also defined. Finally, aging properties of repairable systems are discussed. We show that even in the case of imperfect repair, which is certainly the case for organisms, aging slows down with age and eventually can even fade out.

Responses to painful stimuli either involve the skeletal musculature or are internal but they are experimentally quantified as escape and avoidance’ (Le Magnen, 1998, p. 4). Both types of responses to this source serve adaptive functions. In many species, specific escape mechanisms have evolved for dealing with physical danger. One of the simplest is the withdrawal reflex that removes the organism from damaging stimuli. When specific taste receptors are in contact with bitter substances, they result in a spitting reflex that protects the organism from ingesting possibly toxic substances that are generally associated with the bitter taste. In Chapter 5 the mechanisms by which rats learn to avoid smells and tastes that have previously been followed by illness were examined. Animals will also react to aversive stimuli with attack behaviour, particularly when escape is difficult. Such a reaction is particularly evident in feral animals.",

      "title": "Education and Character: A Conservative View.",
      "abstract": "Good character education is made up of three elements, Mr. Doyle avers - example, study, and practice. In the final analysis life is about moral choices, not about technique or spontaneous unfolding. From the time of the ancient Greeks to sometime in the late 19th century, a singular idea obtained: education's larger purpose was to shape character, to make men (and later, women) better people. Education and training were not confused. Education was liberal - from liberalis, the Latin for free, as distinct from slave. Training was (as it remains today) narrow and functional. Education imparted fundamental knowledge - or content, as we would think of it today. It was both essential and instrumental. Mastery of content was the device by which one achieved mastery of self and, in turn, mastery over nature. Born naked and ignorant, humans had neither the tools - teeth that rip, claws that tear, wings that soar, or fins that swim - nor the instincts to survive on their own. No animal is so dependent for so long as the human animal. Yet humans need more than nurturing parents; we need a supportive social order in which to live and thrive. As Aristotle knew, we are political animals: it is our fate - which is to say, our opportunity and our obligation - to live in the polis. Without it we cannot survive. We also need time. Time and the city: we cannot live without culture. Which is to say we cannot live without language. Finally, we cannot live without values. While these three threads are analytically distinct, they are inexorably woven together. Obvious? Perhaps, but in the present climate of education it bears repeating. Culture. Language. Values. In the beginning was the word. A religious conception, to be sure, but an anthropological one as well. One need not believe John to appreciate his insight. Culture is the set of social arrangements we have chosen to organize our lives. Language is culture's quintessential tool, for it permits us to communicate with one another and across time and space. It permits culture to come into existence and to remain over time. And values are the engine that defines and drives culture. We choose Athens or Sparta, tolerance or belligerence, the way of Cato the Elder or that of Cincinnatus. Values are the embodiment of choices; we can choose to forbear or to indulge. Or, as the ancient Greeks and later Romans knew so well, we can choose when to forbear and when to indulge. Dionysus, the Greek god of wine (from whose name the modem name Denis is derived), stands in counterpoise to Apollo, god of reason. They exist in sharp tension: one, the god of abandon; the other, the god of restraint. Such is the enduring power of myths that they embody living truths today no less than yesterday. Today, of course, the political scientist more readily thinks of Rousseau and Hobbes - the modern exemplars of self-indulgence and self-restraint - than of Dionysus and Apollo. Indeed, as E. D. Hirsch so ably and persuasively demonstrates in his new book, The Schools We Need, it is the legacy of Rousseau, filtered through romanticism, that explains today's educational wilderness. This heritage does much to explain our cultural wilderness as well. Self-expression rather than self-restraint, a belief that the child knows more than the adult, a conviction that children are innately good and need only to be nourished for a spontaneous unfolding to occur - these are the ideas of Rousseau and the romantic (whether Schiller or Whitman). To .any parent .they even have the ring of partial truth; to be sure, there is in every child a divine spark. There is in every child the capacity for truth and beauty. Indeed, so far as we can tell, every child is hard-wired for language. But this is an incomplete list of the child's potential. It is at best fatuous, at worst dangerous, to ignore the other side of the ledger. Children - and the adults they become - have the potential for dreadful behavior as well as good. …",

      "abstract": "Research findings in the field of clothing design underline that a garment must ensure a high level of comfort as it interacts with the shape of the human body, regardless of whether the person is in a static or dynamic state. For economic, medical and psychological reasons, it is essential that a garment fits well and adapts to the wearer’s body shape in terms of 3D geometry, volume and structure (there are areas where the garment is very close to the body and areas where it is away from the body). Several factors need to be taken into account when producing various soft goods, including garments: factors related to the client (age, posture, proportions and conformation, type and frequency of movements, medical problems, physical disabilities, etc.) and the product (destination, condition of use, characteristics of materials and accessories, etc.). This paper presents the influence of the biomechanics of the human body on the 3D shape of a garment. The geometry and the size of the garment patterns must be determined taking into account the details of the model (silhouette, destination, structure, types of materials, etc.) and, above all, the movement of the human body expressed in terms of the absolute values of the changes in its dimensions or dynamic effects.",

From this perspective, as Sapontzis (1987) convincingly argues, life has important instrumental value to the animal (or human) that possesses it. I will briefly identify arguments against Sapontzis's position – that killing cannot be a harm because the victim no longer exists and so cannot feel or be harmed. I will also argue that killing deprives the victim of its welfare. To argue for this position, I will adopt Sumner's account of human welfare, and then apply it to animals. As an aside, I will comment on the questions, under what circumstances are we morally justified in killing an animal and what obligations do we have, if any, toward animals not under our care.",

      "title": "Power and Authority",
      "abstract": "At first glance, medieval saints’ lives seem to have a fairly clear attitude toward power and authority: they value the latter over the former, frequently pitting a saint who has only faith and the ultimate auctoritas of God on his or her side against a representative of coercive, worldly power and showing the saint’s decisive triumph. Seemingly unprotected against the full onslaught of governmental, parental or purely aggressive power, the saint manages, with God’s help in the form of spiritual support, miracles, angelic aid and other unexpected resources, ultimately to beat those powers at their own game. As such victories suggest, however, medieval saints and, even more, medieval hagiographers were actually in a somewhat awkward position with regard to power and authority. On the one hand, saints in their pursuit of moral perfection tended ostentatiously to renounce all earthly goods, including secular power, and to regard them as corrupting. On the other hand, saints are inevitably depicted as exercising considerable spiritual authority, usually even before their deaths, and could invoke the awesome power of God through miracles of punishment, destruction and healing. A good number of them also held earthly power, or influenced those who did. Thus the claim that ‘Saints in this life were meek, humble and powerless. After death the situation is reversed’ points to a certain ideal of Christian reversal – that the last shall be first, that strength lies in weakness – but hardly represents accurately the hagiographic depiction of saints during their lives. Quite often a saint, while explicitly, indeed ostentatiously, despising the trappings of earthly power, proves able to exploit the implications of that power and even usurp it.",

There is a certain connection between the degree of self-experience and self-responsibility (primary existence) and the choice to speak or write in the I-, YOU- or ΟΝΕ-mode, but apparently it also holds that the choice of one of those modes restricts or elaborates the space a person has to express himself. More generally stated: There is a certain interaction between the way of existence of a speaker or writer and the way of self-denomination in his utterances. 2. There is a certain connection between the degree to which a speaker or writer a) has knowledge about himself and wants to be responsible for his feelings, thoughts and acts; b) guards or unveils his intimacy towards a hearer or reader; c) wants to be involved in or responsible for a process or activity outside his body; and the way he denominates himself or the outside process or activity in his utterances. I give some examples of ways of linguistic alienation, and propose an arrangement of the degrees of alienation in the same way as is done in language for local distances: HERE THERE YONDER SOMEWHERE NOWHERE I I, as a.. YOU ONE NONE (self) (increasing self-separation) (self-ignoring) (self-eliminating) I expect that children with a very sensitive linguistic intuition, draw conclusions about the reliability of adults from the way they use alienation codes; that human beings are or become strangers to one another, or are more attached as friends and lovers by using alienation codes or direct human language; that relational, social and economic victims advertise themselves as potential victims by the way they use alienation codes and do not recognize their potential oppressors by the way they use alienation codes. The main field of linguistic study as human linguistics lies in making clear what the differences are between direct human language and alienation codes.",

They have been dened as those activities in which individuals experience leisure dierently, due to their being taken to the limit of their resources. These activities can range from 'abnormal' leisure, such as unprotected anal intercourse, to extreme sports. They have been seen as allowing the individual to experience transcendence beyond the mundane and everyday, with a suggestion that such pursuits aord a particular glimpse into the human condition (see Blackshaw, 2009). For those of us seeking new directions in this area of Leisure Studies, extreme sports are a rich resource. The focus in this chapter, therefore, is on extreme sporting activities, on which, since the 1980s, there has been theoretical and empirical work on the more established alternative sports such as skateboarding, rock climbing and surng, whilst activities such as windsurng, snowboarding, BMX biking, extreme ironing, extreme skiing, ultimate Frisbee, kitesurng, in-line skating, parkour, whitewater kayaking and adventure racing have also been dened as alternative sports as the category has both expanded and diversied.",

      "abstract": "What is a human life worth? The philosophical answer, echoed in literature throughout the ages, is that life is priceless. The answer under the American tort system is “zero.” Wrongful death systems in the U.S. do not attach any value to life itself. Rather, the value of human life is calculated largely by the value of the monetary and service contributions that the deceased tort victim could have been expected to give to her dependents, minus her personal consumption expenses, had she lived. This is known as the “pecuniary loss rule.” The primary thesis of this article is that life does have independent value, far greater than simply what people earn and give to others. There is value to working at one’s chosen occupation, to loving, to laughing, to walking on the beach, to watching the sun set, and to all of the other activities that make up the pleasure of living. The article asserts that, by failing to account for the value of life itself, current wrongful death statutes are discriminatory and result in the substantial undervaluation of the human life among large groups of society, including children, elderly people, and low-wage earners. The author asserts that wrongful death law in America be amended to allow damages for the lost value of human life, sometimes called “hedonic damages,” as a means of promoting both the general deterrence and corrective justice goals of tort law. One of the earliest articles exploring hedonic damages, It’s a Wonderful Life has been extensively cited by courts and legal scholars.",

      "abstract": "The foundations that serve together with the soils of the foundations of buildings and structures are directly or indirectly borrowed by Man from what was created in Nature - supports of her living and non-living creations: the feet of Man or animals, the roots of plants. Different types of foundations have their counterparts in nature. It is interesting to see how and why these or other forms of Supports appeared, their sizes, how they change, adapt to changes in the environment during the existence of the creation of Nature. And how a Man can use the finds of Nature in his activities in the design of foundations and even buildings and structures. Examples are a pillar foundation that can be cut from a person’s foot; slab foundation - paws of waterfowl; Pile foundation essentially has much in common with the legs of hoofed animals. The heat-insulated foundation can be compared with the paws of a polar bear, whose feet are “lined” with fur. Particular attention is paid to the root system of the tree, which can be considered an ideal foundation. The ability of various trees to adapt to the terrain on which it grows is an example of a possible approach to designing rational types of foundations. The principle of inclusion in the work under the loads of the soil surrounding the root system is implemented in the Tree. At the same time, the roots “reinforce” the surrounding soil, create from it a single system, which perceives the loads acting on the tree. Such an approach is implemented, for example, when constructing foundations or hardening soils using the geotechnogenic system.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The image most people have of textual interpretation is similar to observing a painting: there is an object outside us with a clearly independent existence (i.e., if we walk away from it, it presumably remains hanging on the wall), whose meaning we, the observers, try to understand. We arc all aware that not everyone will appreciate the painting or articulate its meaning in the same way; we admit that in most cases, to be able to “see” the significance of various motifs in the work of art requires training or at least exposure to certain cultural artifacts. If the artist intended to evoke specific themes by incorporating into the painting salient elements associated with earlier works of art, then viewers unacquainted with those other paintings would fail to “see” these allusions; they would be “missing” something that is “there” for those trained to notice it. Of course, this is not a permanent handicap; viewers can be instructed to see things they did not “see” before. Just think of the recorded tours a person may listen to while touring an exhibit: the oral tour guide “points things out” that one may not have known before, after which one “sees” the work of art in a new light.",

      "abstract": "Every individual is not automatically able to realize his desires, but humans are forbidden to forget God while in the effort to realize these desires in the form of service obligations and responsibilities. For this reason, humans are given the to choose between good and bad things. God himself has given trust to humans so that people always choose the good. God has made freedom an ethical foundation for humans to do. However, it turns out that there are many people who are unable to maintain God's trust; Most humans often choose bad deeds. The failure of religious obligations and irresponsibility is a form of human error in choosing freedom, and at the same time betrays God's trust in humanity. The failure of humans to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities is caused by the shortsightedness and narrowness of the human mind, and because of the shortsightedness and narrowness of the mind, humans often lose moral balance. In a long time, shortsightedness and narrowness of the mind will make the conscience of humans frozen, as a result humans increasingly away from the nature of events. Setiap individu tidak secara otomatis mampu merealisasikan keinginannya, namun manusia dilarang melupakan Tuhan selama dalam usaha merealisasikan keinginan tersebut dalam bentuk pengabdian kewajiban dan tanggungjawab. Untuk itu manusia diberi kebebasan memilih antara hal yang baik dan yang buruk. Tuhan sendiri telah member kepercayaan kepada manusia agar manusia senantiasa memilih yang baik. Tuhan telah menjadikan “kebebasan” sebagai “landasan etika” bagi manusia dalam berbuat. Akan tetapi ternyata banyak orang yang tidak mampu memelihara kepercayaan Tuhan tersebut; manusia kebanyakan sering memilih perbuatan yang buruk. Tidak terlaksananya kewajiban-kewajiban agama serta sikap tidak bertanggungjawab adalah bentuk kesalahan manusia dalam memilih kebebasan, dan itu sekaligus menghianati kepercayaan Tuhan kepada umat manusia. Gagalnya manusia menunaikan kewajiban dan tanggungjawab disebabkan oleh kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran manusia, dan karena kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran itu, manusia sering kehilangan keseimbangan moral. Dalam waktu yang lama, kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran akan menjadikan “hati nurani” manusia beku, akibatnya manusia semakin jauh dari fitrah kejadiannya.",

Let a man once assume a good God or a righteous universe, and he thereby also assumes that all events must be directed, or at least overruled, for good. Perhaps, however, it is a little easier to declare what one means when he says, “there is a God,” than to explain what one means by “the divine Providence.” Do we believe in a special Providence, that enters into each particular act or moment, so that, for example, it is literally true that not a sparrow “shall fall to the ground without your Father”? Do we think that the infinite Power carries every individual life in its thought, and even plans, and cares what each man does, suffers, or enjoys? Or do we think of Providence as merely a general guiding agency, like the intelligence that steers a ship in safety without any special responsibility for the conduct or the pleasure of the passengers? Do we think that a man can interfere, by the exercise of his little will, with the working of divine Providence? Or does Providence also enter into and direct the motion of every individual will, as it may be conceived to enter into the motion of the sands on the beach?",

      "title": "To Adopt the Intentional Stance?",
      "abstract": "We begin our commentary with a bit of common-sense or everyday psychology, because intention is a notion that originates in our everyday understanding of human action. This introductory analysis allows us then to attend efficiently to Lewis's article. We conclude by mentioning some related research of our own. Much of our everyday reasoning people is concerned with the psychological causes of, or explanations for, their behavior. Why did he take that job? Why is she going to Alaska? Why is he divorcing his second wife? In attempting to explain these sorts of things we seek motivations, and an important everyday construct is desire-what the person wants. In this everyday conception (see Wellman, 1990), a desire is a mental state or attitude an object or event that motivates possible actions toward that object or event. To elaborate, we can compare desires to other sorts of explanatory constructs such as drives and tropisms. For example, both drives (e.g., he is hungry) and desires (e.g., he wants an apple) are constructs ordinarily used to describe internal motivational states behind certain actions, such as relieving hunger or obtaining an apple. But in specifics and in emphasis, drives and desires are quite different sorts of everyday descriptions. Drives describe something like the organism's internal physiological state, whereas desires focus on a specific object (or event or state of affairs) that is sought. Drives are relatively silent objects, whereas desires are silent physiology. For example, being hungry can be satisfied by an apple, a banana, or a hamburger. The object is not (essentially) described by stating the drive. But wanting an is not satisfied by a banana; the object is essential. In short, although drives and desires are similar in some respects, they are different in that desires, not drives, encompass a specified object. What tropisms? Tropisms seem to have an object directedness, as for example, plants that grow toward sunlight or mosquitoes that seek blood. However, in everyday conception, desires are psychological states whereas tropisms are not. The flower does not want to grow to the sun, the mosquito does not desire blood. How do we differentiate the two? An answer seems to lie in the relationship between desires and other psychological states. Desires are intimately linked to companion psychological states, in particular, to emotions. Tropisms, in contrast, are not linked to emotions. The flower is not happy when it orients toward the sun; the mosquito is not sad if everyone at the picnic is wearing insect repellent. But if Bill wants an apple, he will be happy or pleased to get one and sad or angry or disappointed not to. A consideration of the everyday notion of desire is helpful in discussing two importantly different senses of the word intention. Intention, in the everyday colloquial sense, involves a purpose or goal. Perhaps the simplest such intention is a desire; if Bill buys an apple because he wants one, then he does so intentionally. Intention in the broader philosophical sense refers to a class of mental states known as intentional states or propositional attitudes. These mental states are attitudes toward a proposition, or mental states about some external real-world object or state of affairs. In this sense having a thought an apple, a memory of an apple, as well as a goal to get an apple, are all intentional. Lewis tends to obscure this distinction in his article, but it is important to keep straight. Desires are especially intriguing because they partake of both senses. Wanting an apple is about an apple and hence is a classic intentional state in the philosophical sense. Wanting an apple also implies a goal-directed state in the more everyday sense of intention. Now we turn to Lewis's article. Lewis addresses issues of intention in children; his focus and his terminology have their roots, initially, in such everyday notions as goals, desires, and purposes. Here is the thrust of Lewis's complex article, as we see it: The article begins with an inspiration, encompasses an intriguing empirical phenomenon, identifies a conceptual problem, and proposes a solution which attempts to advance the inspiration and circumvent the problem. In more detail, Lewis asks when we can attribute intentions to the child, and what forms intention might take within and between levels of development. The inspiration behind this endeavor seems to be that a good deal can potentially be understood intention by tracing it to its earliest roots. Lewis tries to advance this initial inspiration in several ways. One way is to discuss some intriguing data from infants. The intrigue of these data as we see them concerns the implication of emotions for analyses of intentions. Here Lewis trades on the common-sense notion that desires are intimately tied to emotions somewhat as described earlier. Lewis finds that 2-month-old infants, for example, will increase their arm pulling to activate the presentation of a pleasurable stimulus. Critically, in addition to increased arm pulling, when the arm pulling succeeds, his young subjects show increased interest and joy. When the contingency is changed, and arm pulling no longer produces the expected result, the infants show anger, frustration, and surprise. According to a common-sense psychological framework, if infants show happiness when the arm pulling works and sadness or anger when it does not work, it is sensible and illuminating to say that they desire the event to happen, and in this limited sense to say that they are acting intentionally. All this seems well and good-to trace the origins of intention is admirable, and studies with infants linking their actions and emotions may, if fully developed, reveal unexpected competencies. At this point (at least as we reconstruct his argument) Lewis goes on to sketch a developmental theory of intention. This theory has a peculiar shape to it, however, and this shape stems from Lewis's attempt to craft a theory designed to solve what he sees as a deep problem. There are two components to this problem. First, he does not want to claim that 2-month-old infants are revealing full adult intentionality. But their behavior may prove to be motivated by something like desires. Thus, Lewis advocates that we adopt a broad view of intention, broad enough so that his 2-montholds and adults exist on the same continuum. Second, when Lewis considers the origin of intentionality in the child he feels he faces a logical or conceptual obstacle. Crudely put, the obstacle is how to get intention out of a system if it is not",

You, for example, are a man and your mind is “inner” in the sense that you alone can reflectively experience yourself thinking, or feeling pain, or seeing colours (or at least that you alone can reflectively experience your own thoughts, feelings and visual experiences). I can in a sense observe you thinking, but only by observing you use your body in certain ways—e.g. to make certain sounds, write certain things, look at the pages of an open book and frown. My “experience” of you thinking (or of your thoughts) is thus not a reflective experience. Your body is “outer”, on the other hand, in the sense that you cannot experience it or its (non-relational) properties in any exclusive way. That is, in whatever sense you can be said to experience your body, someone else can equally be said to experience it.",

      "title": "Historiographical Imagination about Savagery and Barbaric Stages of Primitive Human Species",
      "abstract": "Indeed, Imagination could not work as a valid method for understanding prehistory and pre-historical processes as subjective or objective source. Yet historiographical imagination is only available inductive method for writing prehistory and pre-historical processes. Out of the few significant inherent natural features of the mind of Homo sapiens, a product of evolution memory, imagination, creativity, and power of comprehending complex natural processes are against preceding minds of primitive human species. The naturally evolved primitive human mind also learnt art of making fire, bow and arrows, pottery, stone implements, adobe-brick houses and later plantation by irrigation. The two historical facts transmuted the existing basic instincts making them primitive humans, other than preceding species of humans. 1) The phenomenon of inter-tribal battles, becoming order of the day during savagery because of sneaking clandestinely or openly, from other human tribes women, children, and domestic animals provided four kinds of human in a victorious tribe, “victor male”, “victor female”, “subjugated male” and “subjugated female”, which transfigured the existing sexual behavior in a tribe; and 2) the other phenomenon of “surplus labor” available only to males because of “surplus pregnancy” of females finally became the instigator of distinction between female and male, which in due course during the various stages of savagery and barbarism became susceptible for the origin of patriarchy. The present paper deals with the historiographical imagination as an inductive method for understanding responses of primitive human mind during various stages of savagery and barbarism.",

Relatedly, ‘conventions’ may be associated with what is distinctive to ‘human’, as opposed to ‘bestial’ nature, or denounced for their role in repressing our more ‘natural’ impulses.",

What's more, we blame ourselves, not only for our moral failings, but also for our non-moral failings: for our aesthetic bad taste, gustatory self-indulgence, or poor athletic performance. And we blame ourselves both for things over which we exerted agential control (e.g., our voluntary acts) and for things over which we lacked such control (e.g., our desires, beliefs, and intentions). I argue that, despite this manifest diversity in our blaming practices, it's possible to provide a comprehensive account of blame. Indeed, I propose a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that aims to specify blame's extension in terms of its constitution as opposed to its function. And I argue that this proposal has a number of advantages beyond accounting for blame in all its disparate forms.",

This is based on the understanding that humans who want the happiness of the Hereafter, will take the path that is not less than six kinds of positions, namely: a diligent person, or a scientist, or a student or officer, or entrepreneur, or a person solely subjected to monotheism . Whoever has attained the most honorable degree will feel the presence of his heart with God in all things. Nothing else occurred to him, and no one else tapped his hearing, nor his views, except those charged with worship. It is not worth a person who desires this dignity to himself, then becomes lazy in his worship. Indeed, the signs of this man who attains this dignity do not occur to him in an anxious, unimaginable heart, and will not be surprised by the shock of the situation anyhow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tulisan ini membahas tentang bagaimana menemukan jati diri sangat penting untuk kemudian menempatkannya pada posisi yang tepat. Hal ini berdasarkan pemahaman bahwa manusia yang menginginkan kebahagiaan akhirat, akan menempuh jalannya yang tidak kurang dari enam macam posisi yaitu : orang yang tekun beribadah, atau ilmuwan, atau pelajar (mahasiswa) atau pejabat, atau pengusaha, atau orang yang semata-mata menekuni tauhid. Barangsiapa telah mencapai derajat yang paling mulia akan merasakan kehadiran hatinya bersama dengan Allah dalam segala halnya. Tiada lagi hal lain terlintas dalam hatinya, dan tiada lagi yang mengetuk pendengarannya, maupun pandangannya, kecuali yang bermuatan ibadah. Tidak pantas sama sekali seorang yang menginginkan martabat ini pada dirinya, lalu menjadi malas ibadahnya. Sesungguhnya tanda-tanda orang yang mencapai martabat ini tidak terlintas dalam hatinya sifat kuatir, dan tidak terbayang suatu maksiat di dalam hatinya, serta tidak akan dikejutkan oleh kegoncangan situasi bagaimanapun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "A witness is defined as one who provides of a fact or an event whose attestation fulfills the role of or serving as evidence to that which has occurred. [1] Such attestation becomes concrete and enduring through either the witness' written record or the legal provision of testimony within a court of law.\n\nBy its nature, history is subject to interpretation by those who were not present. Sometimes, interpretation challenges the very existence of events themselves (historical revisionism). Historical research, therefore, must be founded upon the physical record of primary archival material and the testimony of witnesses to maintain its veracity. While the witness is often chosen by fate alone, in certain situations special skills may choose the witness. The observations made by such a witness coupled with astute interpretation of the reasons for the events themselves can serve as catalysts that modify subsequent human conduct.\n\nSuch a witness was neurology's own Leo Alexander. Because of his special skills in linguistics, neurobiology, and psychiatry, Alexander was chosen to prepare intelligence reports on medical practices within the Third Reich's army, its mental institutions, and its prison camps immediately after the end of World War II. In a frenzy of activity during one brief summer in 1945, and under a mandate from the Combined Intelligence Operative Sub-Committee (CIOS) of the United States VIIth Army, Alexander completed seven reports providing first-hand testimony of the perversion of medicine and medical science in the totalitarian setting of Nazi Germany. [2-8] These reports contained primary archival material, debriefings of physician-participants, and synopses of Alexander's review of captured documents. They were prepared not only to satisfy the intelligence needs of a victorious army, but also to fulfill an individual physician's need to record and comprehend for posterity that which bordered on the incomprehensible.\n\nThere can …",

By lifting the prohibition against killing, death by murder becomes available for consumption and in turn engenders the desire for more murder. Mass murder is committed by one human being against another and spreads as a murderous jouissance that constantly reproduces itself. This annullation is the production of a constructed and willful ignorance on the side of the perpetrator, which in turn provokes a silence and a silencing, a paralysis on the side of the victim. A murder signifies an act of cutting that founds the origin of a people, which does not suppose conscious knowledge, and carries the seal of primal repression. Religion is thus founded collectively on the condition that this repression becomes the mystery or sacred enigma.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Restrictions of preterm newborns' movements could have consequences ranging from stress enhancement to impairment of their motor development. Therefore, ability to freely express motor activities appears crucial for their behavioural and physiological development. Our aim was to evaluate behavioural issues of two types of clothing used in NICU. We observed 18 healthy 34–37 post-conception week-old preterm newborns, during resting periods, when they were undisturbed by any interventions. Newborns wore either light clothing (bodysuit and a light wrapping) or heavy clothing (pyjamas, cardigan and sleep-sack). The percentages of time each subject spent in different postures were compared between clothing situations. Arm and hand postures differed in relation to clothing: babies bent their arms more and held their hands nearer their heads when in bodysuits than when in sleepwear. Consequently, babies in bodysuits spent more time touching their body or their environment whereas the others generally were touching nothing. Self-touch is an important way to comfort one's self. Heavy clothing may impair self-soothing behaviours of preterm newborn babies that already lack other forms of contact. Results suggest that more attention should be paid to apparently routine and marginal decisions such as choice of clothes.",

Based on the explanation in the discussion section, it can be concluded: (1) the terms used in the Qur'an in referring to humans are al-Insan (referring to humans who have special qualities and potential), al-Basyar (referring to humans as biological creatures), and al-Nas (referring to humans as social creatures); (2) The views of the figures on the nature of humans differ but the essence is the same, namely humans as creatures who have different potential from other creatures of Allah; (3) Humans are referred to as ahsan al-taqwin which places humans in a strategic position, namely as servants of Allah and as caliphs of Allah",

      "abstract": "When we think about being good, morally good that is, what comes to mind is being good to others, and in less definite, though still important way, being good to ourselves. One set of virtues which comes into consideration are generosity, beneficence, and justice, with the focus perhaps, on welfare and rights. In Hume's words, a mind will never be able to bear its own survey, that has been wanting in its part to mankind and society.' In less definite way, virtues benefit self too (as Hume himself argues), and some benefit self directly, even though those same virtues may on other occasions be directed toward others. An individual may act with courage in the face of horrible disease or in circumstances which threaten morale and make suicide seem an attractive escape. Non-deception, temperance, and respect each can focus on self in ways that are morally admirable and praiseworthy. Equally, virtues focused on others may be said to have indirect benefit to their possessors, in the sense that they enhance their moral perfection. Put differently, we tend to think of virtues as self and other-regarding, and indeed in general, think of morality as matter of how we attend to individuals, whether it be ourselves or others, and in the case of others, strangers or loved ones, sometimes with regard to numbers, sometimes not. The preoccupation in contemporary moral literature with self/other asymmetries, with perspectives that break away from the agent neutrality of consequentialism, presuppose the same general worries about what we owe self and what we owe other.2 Appeal to the importance of giving due regard, sometimes moral, sometimes prudential, to self in distinction from others again echoes that",

      "abstract": "Abstract It seems that not every act of sexual lust is, for the following reasons: Fornication is an act of sexual lust. But we list fornication with things permitted, not with things that are sinful as such. For Acts 15:28–29 says: “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and us not to impose on you any burden beyond what is necessary, that you abstain from foods sacrificed to idols, from the blood of animals, from the meat of strangled animals, and from fornication.” And no consumption of food as such is sinful, since 1 Tim. 4:4 says: “We should reject nothing that we receive with thanksgiving to God.” Therefore, neither is fornication a sin, and so not every act of sexual lust is sinful. Having intercourse with a woman is a natural act, and so the act considered as such is not a sin, just as looking at a woman is not, since each of these acts is the act of a natural power. But looking at a woman who is not one’s wife is not a sin. Therefore, neither is having intercourse with a woman not one’s wife a sin. If fornication is a sin, this is so either because of the power that elicits the act or because of the matter or because of the purpose. But fornication is not sinful because of the power, since the power that elicits the act is natural. And fornication is not sinful because of the matter, since the matter consists of women created by God for this purpose, as Gen. 2:18 says: “Let us make for the man a helper like himself. It also may be the case that fornication is not sinful because of its purpose, as, for example, if one fornicates with the intention of begetting a child in order to foster worship of God. There-fore, it seems that not every act of fornication is sinful.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In ordinary speech, “well‐being” is often used interchangeably with such terms as “health,” “happiness,” and “prosperity” ( see Happiness). To be concerned about someone's well‐being is to care whether he is doing or faring well. The word “well” that appears in these expressions plays an evaluative role – it is the adverbial form of the adjective “good,” and of course “good” is a grade we use to evaluate things. If someone is well‐off, his life is good. Hence, it is not surprising that we commonly move back and forth so easily between “well‐being” and such terms as “health,” “happiness,” and “prosperity”: most people assume that the life of a human being is a good one – that someone living such a life is faring well – only if it has at least some measure of these goods.",

I am going to look at five kinds of experience: • the experience of the moral ‘ought’; • the experience of beauty; • the experience of meaning conferred by stories; • the experience of otherness and transcendence; • the experience of vulnerability and fragility. These seem to me to be integral features of any meaningful human life. They are aspects of what it is to be human. Some theists would simply agree with that statement. Others, however, would say that though essentially human they are also essentially religious, and that the secular humanist's participation in such experiences is in some way defective. That is the claim which I want to consider and contest.",

      "abstract": "To reiterate: neither methodologically nor ontologically does an anthropology of ethics have its ground in the individual. The population of its interpretive universe is instead one of subjects in or passing through positions in environments. It is thus a population not of atomic units but of complex relata. Its subjects are for their part already highly complex. They may be individual human beings (though never human beings in their pure individuality). They may be the individualized subjects of the formally egalitarian society; Homines hierarchici, the holistic dividuals of the caste-structured social system (Daniel 1984; Dumont 1980, 1986); the relationalist subjects that Robbins and many others have encountered in Melanesia (Robbins 2004: 13). They may be human collectives, or even human and non-human collectives or assemblages of one or another kind. Nothing in principle precludes the possibility of a cyborgic ethics, an ethics of quasi-objects (Latour 1993), an ethics of corporations of an economic or of some other sort. The only proviso is that the subject occupying or passing through its position in an environment be at or beyond the threshold of the complexity requisite of any system capable of autopoiesis, though such a requirement is never the sufficient condition of an ethical subject position, even a potentially ethical one. Individual human beings typically display such complexity, yet do so only after a considerable course of socialization has taken place, only after a considerable dose of the intersubjective has already been incorporated, already become part of the self (and hence are never individuals in their pure individuality).",

      "title": "The One and the Many: Unity in Diversity",
      "abstract": "Divine or the Ultimate Reality expresses itself in many names and forms -- in male and female aspects e.g.: compassion in Buddhism by Kwanin-Kwanon, green Tara, White Tara, and Red Tara, adding a dimension of healing, purity and strength to the manifestation; Buddha as All Compassionate One, or Allah as Rahim or Rehman (the most merciful/ compassionate) in Islam, and the Lord or King as being the Sovereign or Supreme used in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism. most common ways of addressing God in Hinduism as the master of all are surrender, sacrifice as offerings from devotees and servants of Gods. In Hinduism, all gods and goddesses are representations of Divinity in the many qualities of consciousness in the manifest world. Divine is One, the Infinite, Immortal, Eternal, One Without a Second, but the names and forms of the Divine are many and diverse in the phenomenal world. They embody in the finite the imprint of the Infinite Spirit in the three hundred and thirty billion thousands of gods and goddesses which reveal the essence of Divinity in unique form. India and Hinduism have been called a culture of spiritual billionaires or trillionaires. It has also been labeled as polytheistic, pagan, heathen, and what not. Those who do not comprehend the vast, versatile and complex language of Indian art, architecture, music, mathematics, metaphysics, mythology and symbology as archetypes of life, the embodiment in form and name of the great truths of the Infinite and the Eternal--miss the entire point of Hinduism and its vast culture of consciousness -- that myths, symbols, sacred rituals, sacred journeys, mantras (chants) and pilgrimages are not ends in themselves but are pathways to the Infinite, and they symbolize the qualities of consciousness, means or vehicles of communication for liberation and self-realization in the individual and the community for transformation, that they are processes of initiation. As Shakyamuni Buddha says: Making offerings to me now and making offerings to a statue of me in the future will be of equal merit ... This is due to the blessing power of the Buddha, but ordinary beings cannot understand this. And Rabindrath Tagore has said: The great is to be found in the small. Infinite within the bonds of form. And the Eternal freedom of the soul in Love. Hinduism, therefore, has gods and goddesses that are personal -- Sita Rama, Radha-Krishna, Ishvara-Ihsvari, Ganesha Hanuman, Brahma (Creator of the Universe), Vishnu (nurturer-preserver), Shiva (destroyer of ignorance and evil and regeneration of the universe), Shiva and Shakti, Mahasarasvati (goddess of wisdom, knowledge, music and science), Mahalakshmi (goddess of good fortune and beauty) and so on and so forth. Brahman (godhead) as the Absolute, as impersonal aspect represents the Cosmic Divine, as immanent in the universe in every nerve, fiber, cell, breath, atom or molecule that vibrates with its power and force and light, connects, unites, integrates and transcends it -- is the Transcendent Divine. In Judaism, Abraham and Sara (transliteration/ abbreviation for Saraswati) are mentioned. In Christianity, God is expressed as the Father, Jesus as the Son and the Holy Ghost as the Spirit. Islam, Christianity and Judaism all are classified as monotheistic. Hinduism has a monotheism in advaita Vedanta, and in its deistic, theistic and polytheistic forms and names coalescing towards the Brahman (godhead). Hindu Festival of Lights (Diwali) and Yom Kippur in Judaism both have similar emphasis on lights and work from a lunar calendar and occur around the same time of year. Historically, the Christian Church adopted several beliefs from the pagans. most glaring example is that of Christmas, which corresponds strongly to a Mithraic winter solstice festival. Christmas tree is quite evidently a derivation of a well-documented pagan German custom. …",

      "abstract": "Does God love what is right because it is right, or is what is right right because God loves it? Socrates's question, first asked in the Euthyphro, has received no completely satisfactory answer. It is, in fact, the beginning of an unpleasant dilemma for theists. For if a theist says that God loves right actions because they are right, then it seems to follow that they are right independently of God's loving them. Were he not to exist, right actions would still be right (and wrong actions would still be wrong). In that case the foundations of ethics do not lie in God but elsewhere. But if they lie elsewhere, why not eliminate the middleman and go directly to the source? On the other hand, if a theist says that right actions are right because God loves them, then it seems as though he believes that just anything that God loves is right, in virtue solely of God's loving it. Theists who grasp the first horn of the dilemma are fond of heaping abuse on those who choose the second. On the second alternative it is alleged to follow that if God were to love injustice, then his loving it would make the practice of injustice morally obligatory. That consequence is scarcely credible, but no more incredible than the further assertion, also an integral part of the second alternative, that God's loving something is supposed to provide sufficient moral reason for our loving it. Defenders of the second horn are quick to repay the compliment. They accuse their opposite numbers of reducing God to the role of dispensable moral mouthpiece, at best a vade mecum in our quest for moral truth. There is a position from which a theist can slip between the horns of the dilemma, preserving what should be preserved on both sides and discarding what should be discarded. It is useful to consider the dilemma in tandem with another theistic conundrum-",

      "title": "Visual search speed is influenced by differences in shape arbitrariness",
      "abstract": "We hypothesized that the visual system is particularly tuned to those features which correlate with behaviorally relevant dimensions, and compared a few possibilities: how man-made an object is (naturalness), how often an object is eaten (edibility), how often an object is manipulated (manipulability), and the degree to which an object’s shape is arbitrary (shape arbitrariness; Prasada, 2001). For example, the shape of a hammer is more constrained by the kind of thing that it is (i.e., is less arbitrary) than the shape of a rock. Does variability in perceptual similarity among sets of small, inanimate objects correlate with behavioral ratings on any of these dimensions? We chose four sets (categories) of stimuli: manipulable artifacts (e.g., pens), non-manipulable artifacts (e.g., lamps), natural objects (e.g. pinecones), and fruits/vegetables. These categories did not differ on ratings of typicality, familiarity, internal details, and visual complexity, or in area, aspect ratio, contour variance, extent, spatial frequency, contrast, or luminance. Participants searched for a target image among distractors from the same or different category; they pressed a space bar when they found the target, and reported its location by clicking X’s that replaced the original images. For each category pairing, the difference in search speeds between same- and different-category trials was taken as an index of perceptual dissimilarity, and correlated with distances in each dimension for each subject (representational similarity analysis). Neither manipulability nor edibility explained the pattern of perceptual dissimilarity among categories (all r< .1, t< 1,p>.3). Although naturalness explained some variance (r=.16, t=2.13, p=.048), shape arbitrariness explained more (r=.40, t=4.05, p< .0001). Visual features correlated with shape arbitrariness include shape symmetry and regularity, according to ratings(r=.74, p< .001). These results suggest that, among inanimate objects, the visual system may be particularly sensitive to the perceptual features correlated with the arbitrariness of their shapes.

      "abstract": "Most of us think we know some basic facts about how time works. The facts we believe we know are based on a few intuitions about time, which are, in turn, based on our conscious waking experiences. As far as I can tell, these intuitions about time are something like this: 1) There is a physical world in which events occur, 2) These events are mirrored by our perceptual re-creation of them in essentially the same order in which they occur in the physical world, 3) This re-creation of events occurs in a linear order based on our conscious memory of them (e.g., event A is said to occur before event B if at some point we do remember event A but we don not yet remember event B, and at another point we remember both events), 4) Assuming we have good memories, what we remember has occurred in the past and what we don not remember but we can imagine might: a) never occur, b) occur when we are not conscious, or c) occur in the future. These intuitions are excellent ones for understanding our conscious conception of ordered events. However, they do not tell us anything about how the non-conscious processes in our brains navigate events in time. Currently, neuroscientists assume that neural processes of which we are unaware, that is, non-conscious processes, create conscious awareness as a reflection of physical reality (Singer, 2015). Thus, if we wish to understand how events unfold in time in the physical world, we would do well to attempt to get some hints about how these events are navigated by non-conscious processes.",

      "abstract": "Consciousness is invariably a slippery construct, but especially so when it comes to considering its relationship to motivation. To take an everyday example, consider the case of scratching an insect bite. When bitten by a mosquito, one knows that scratching will ultimately just increase the itching. Sometimes one simply gives in to the urge and deliberately scratches the darn thing, knowing full well the subsequent price that will be paid. In this case, it is clear that the motivation to scratch was fully conscious. But what about the case in which one suddenly catches oneself scratching the forbidden itch? There is this moment of realization to the effect, “Ahh, that feels good, but oh, I didn't want to do that.” In one sense, such actions lack conscious awareness, as the action that one is engaged in is precisely counter to one's goals. Moreover, there is the sense in which one has “caught” oneself “absentmindedly” engaging in the forbidden behavior. In another sense, however, the action and its concomitant motivation are conscious. That is, after one catches oneself, there is an appreciation of the pleasure that the scratching afforded as it temporarily relieved the itch. In short, when one catches oneself scratching an itch, there is a distinct sense that both the motivation to scratch (the itch) and the action itself (scratching) have been consciously experienced.",

Consider, for example, the controversy concerning abortion. A key issue, of course, is the status of the developing human embryo or fetus that is deliberately destroyed by induced abortion. If the human person is not a particular type of organism, then one could hold that a human organism begins to exist at one time while the human person begins to exist at a later time. If, however, a human person is (whatever else he or she may be) a particular type of organism, then whenever the human organism begins to exist that is the time that the human person begins to exist. Now, consider the issue at the other “edge of life,” namely, euthanasia. Here the issue is the status of the severely debilitated and, perhaps, permanently unconscious or minimally conscious individual. A supporter of euthanasia might look at such an individual and say, “that's the same living organism that used to be grandfather, but that is not grandfather anymore.” The assumption the euthanasia supporter is making is that the “person” is something distinct from the living human organism, albeit associated with it, namely, the consciousness or perhaps a spiritual entity. If we reject that assumption and regard the human person as a particular type of bodily being, a particular type of organism, then the living human individual remains grandfather – the person – and is entitled, from an ethical vantage point, to be treated as such, despite his debilitated condition.",

In this paper, I argue that there are three kinds of social kinds: 1) social kinds whose existence does not depend on human beings having any beliefs or other propositional attitudes towards them (e.g. recession , racism ); 2) social kinds whose existence depends in part on specific attitudes that human beings have towards them, though attitudes need not be manifested towards their particular instances (e.g. money , war ); 3) social kinds whose existence and that of their instances depend in part on specific attitudes that human beings have towards them (e.g. permanent resident , prime minister ). Although all three kinds of social kinds are mind‐dependent, this does not make them ontologically subjective or preclude them from being natural kinds. Rather, what prevents the third kind of social kinds from being natural kinds is that their properties are conventionally rather than causally linked.",

      "title": "OPPORTUNISTIC DEXTERITY OR FLEXIBLE INTELLIGENCE?: CONTEMPLATING THE NATURE OF AMBIVALENCE INTRINSIC TO TRICKSTER ARCHETYPE FIGURES IN TRIBAL FOLKTALES OF JHARKHAND",
      "abstract": "Trickster figures are absolutely universal and they are creations of human collective unconsciousness. And advantageously as well disadvantageously they are not defined (confined) by any single characteristics as they are multifaceted entities, multiform beings and polytropos, with the accumulation of different qualities/features (such as ‘astuteness’, ‘ambivalence’, ‘wit’, ‘clever’, ‘cunning’, ‘tricky’, ‘creative falsehood’, ‘deceitful’ or ‘camouflage’, ‘clown’, ‘coward’, ‘cheat’, ‘humorous’, ‘brave’, etc.) and different forms (gods, demons, humans, animals), depending on the nature and requirement of the narrative programmes. Apart from being the fictional archfigures found in world mythology, folkloric materials and popular culture, the everyday social life of people is filled with the experiences of real tricksters, socially recognized antics of persons who enjoy mixed attributes of cleverness (i.e., good and bad), complementary to the logical rationality and being part of the periphery of their communities and not outside of the communities. Unlike mythological tricksters who are gods, demons, spirits and other supernatural beings, some of them are even known for having voracious appetites for food and bodily pleasure apart from being shape-shifters, rebellious and supreme boundary-crossers, their counterparts in folktales are simple, comprehensible, deliberate violators of social rules and norms, and cultural as well natural. A vast amount of trickster folktales is available in almost all languages across India. However, this study picks a few folktales from the tribal communities of Jharkhand, and the ‘tribal folktales’ is used as a category, a unit for analysis or a semiosphere to investigate the nature and interconnectedness of various elements associated with the trickster folktales. Grouped under four themes based on the actions of the protagonists or antagonists, this study proceeds to construct the nature and availability of oxymoronic figures as fundamental interdependent elements of these tales. This study reveals that the tribal tales have effectively utilized trickster characters to project the concept of altruism, along with the reflection of local culture and their critical interventions. It also highlights the facts that the trickster figures in these tales bring together two opposite worlds for different purposes through border-crossing which is a common phenomenon as far as the tribal trickster folktales are concerned, and it also reflects their worldview of coexistence attitude and perceiving them as an integral part of the ecosystem. Further, this study implies an essential point that the tricksters found in these tribal folktales perform as semiotic generators who mediate between opposites to allow a kind of cultural articulation of different cultural relationships, evaluate their contradictions and renew their moral and ethical values which are essential for the constitution and dissemination of their behaviour. Finally, this study promises to draw a brief sketch of the nature of tricksters and their social function and also unfolds the reason for the speculation that the tricksters are not enjoying heroic admiration and esteem despite their marvellous and altruistic heroic deeds.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Contagion refers to the belief that individuals or objects can acquire the essence of a particular source, such as a disgusting product or an immoral person, through physical contact. This paper documents beliefs in a \"contact-free\" form of contagion whereby an object is thought to inherit the essence of a person when it was designed, but never actually physically touched, by the individual. We refer to this phenomenon as contagion through creative intent or “intention-based contagion” and distinguish it from more traditional forms of contact-based contagion (Studies 1 and 2), as well as alternative mechanisms such as mere association (Studies 2 and 3a). We demonstrate that, like contact-based contagion, intention-based contagion results from beliefs in transferred essence (Study 1) and involves beliefs in transfer of actual properties (Study 4). However, unlike contact-based contagion, intention-based contagion does not appear to be as strongly related to the emotion of disgust (Study 1) and can influence evaluations in auditory as well as visual modalities (Studies 3a–3c).",

      "title": "Thinking Mortal Thoughts",
      "abstract": "Thinking Mortal Thoughts Debra San There is something quite odd about the ancient Greek advice to “think mortal thoughts” (or “think of mortal things”), for what human being past the flush of youth has not trembled at the thought of mortality? Consciousness of our mortal condition is considered a hall-mark of the human species, and is no doubt the reason we alone among the species on the planet entertain notions of divinity. Why then are we counseled to think about what we cannot help thinking about anyway? And what purpose does the advice serve: are those who tender it eager to promote their own fearful frame of mind? Or, on the contrary, are they urging us to be courageous in the face of death? Perhaps the advice intended is to eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Or perhaps “mortal thoughts” are suicidal thoughts, and the object is to shuffle off this mortal coil in a manner, time, and place of our own choosing. Clearly, taken out of context, the injunction “think mortal thoughts” can mean any number of things. But in the context of ancient Greek culture, “think mortal thoughts” means roughly this: “Since you are not one of the immortal gods, be mindful of your limits as a human being. Consciousness of the inevitability of your death should inform the way you live your life, for just as your lifespan is limited by your mortality, so too are your capacities for understanding, for action, and for achievement. This is the truth of your condition; if you don’t accept it, you’ll be frustrated at best, and at worst you’ll incur divine wrath and retribution for attempting to push past your proper human boundaries into sacred turf where you don’t belong and aren’t wanted. Don’t trespass. Don’t even think about it. Don’t assume, in a futile exercise of hubris, that you’re a special case whose transgression [End Page 16] (huperbasia) will be exempt from dire consequences. Gnothi sauton, know yourself as a mortal being, and meden agan, do nothing to excess, or you will suffer the fate of Icarus, who aimed too high and died for it, or the fate of Phaethon, who was destroyed by forces which he thought he could control.” The advice presented here echoes throughout classical Greek drama, whose tragic protagonists are the theatrical descendants of Icarus and Phaethon. When Antigone compares herself to Niobe, the Chorus must remind her that “she was a god, born of gods, and we are only mortals born to die” (925–26). 1 In her failure to think mortal thoughts, Antigone resembles her father, whose refusal to acknowledge his limits is so profound that even after mutilating himself in horror at the discovery of his own transgressions, he must still be reminded that he is no longer “the master of all things” (1675). 2 Pentheus in the Bacchae lacks the stature of either Oedipus or Antigone, but like them he has pretensions beyond the limits befitting a mortal; he fails to exercise the “simple wisdom [that] shuns the thoughts of proud, uncommon men and all their god-encroaching dreams” (427–29). 3 In his arrogant and unrealistic attempt to pit his own puny powers against the incomparable force of the immortal Dionysus, Pentheus suffers the fate of those whose hubris overcomes the temperate virtue of sōphrosunē, “the wisdom that accepts” (390). Even the bloodthirsty, pre-Eumenides Furies of the Eumenides accept the limits which moderation entails: they understand that Zeus “appointeth the mean as the master in all things” (531). 4 One might expect that this cautionary, temperate strain in Greek thinking would appeal to Aristotle, whose doctrine of the mean in Book II of the Nicomachean Ethics might have come straight out of the Oresteia. And yet, when the caution is expressed in the maxim “think mortal thoughts,” Aristotle rejects it, claiming that human beings should try to aim their thoughts at a level so high it cannot really be reached by mortals, which is to say a level as high as that of the immortal gods, whose contemplative, intellectual activity (theōria) soars far above...",

It occurs at the beginning of 10.7, where he begins to give his final views on the ultimate goal of human life, happiness (eudaimonia): “If happiness is activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable that it be activity in accordance with the best virtue” (1177a12–13). This is puzzling, because Aristotle, as we have seen, has throughout the Ethics been deliberately maintaining a kind of indecision as regards what we have called Selection and Collection. Happiness is activity in accordance with virtue – granted – but is it some single such activity (Selection) or all such activities (Collection)? As late as 10.5 he was apparently keeping the question open: “So whether there is one sort of activity or several which are characteristic of a complete and blessedly happy man, the pleasures that bring these activities to completion would in the strict sense be referred to as ‘human pleasures’ ” (1176a26–28). If anything, that passage tips toward Collection, since it speaks of the pleasures that bring these activities to completion (in the plural). Yet in 10.7 the matter is suddenly settled.",

      "title": "OLSEN: an object model for the real time systems design",
      "abstract": "When speaking about the object model, we start by enumerating its main features. However the use of the object model to design a system, does not take into account all of these features because objects are especially designed according to an environment and are generally not reusable in other ones. This is because the temporal behaviour and the communication between objects in a given environment are particular to this environment and not often adaptable to other situations. To solve this problem, we think that the object should be presented in three dimensions. The first dimension represents the structure of the object which is a set of private attributes, the second dimension is the behaviour of the object which is represented by a set of operations applied on the structure of the object. The third dimension (environmental or temporal dimension) represents the behaviour of the object according to an environment and especially the communications between the object itself and the other objects of the system. This paper presents an object model defined according to the three dimensional point of view. The environmental dimension corresponds to a part, called scenario, which puts the object into a given system or environment. This part allows us to define an object independently of any environment and to adapt it to a given system by defining its scenario according to this system. However, the scenario part is not reusable but the structure and the behaviour of the object corresponding to the first two dimensions are completely reusable.",

      "abstract": "The communicative and social value of affect may never be fully appreciated at a conscious level until it is compromised. In fact, much of our communication is carried out not through our words, but with the affective features that accompany those words: the prosody of our speech, our facial expressions, and body postures. Consider, for example, the disrespectful \"tone of voice\" that a teenager might use when speaking to a parent. (In the T.V. sitcom Seinfield, Jerry's mother refers to this as \"the tone\" and warns Jerry not to use it with her.) In the nonverbal domain, consider \"the look\" that some mothers use to control their children's behavior. Indeed, we can communicate \"volumes\" without speaking. In addition to our facial expressions, our body postures and the way we \"carry\" ourselves can communicate internal mood states such as excitement, defensiveness, and depression. For example, a quick look at a good friend may prompt us to ask, \"Are you all right?\" In all of these examples, of course, the affective communication is two-sided. One person is expressing a feeling or thought and the other is perceiving and interpreting the intent of these expressions.",

This latter function of architectural design has strong but modifiable effects on social behaviour and users' mood and productivity and, to some extent, design features also affect health and wellbeing. Too often, however, these important sources of influence are ignored or not recognized, despite repeated demonstrations of these effects. While much remains to be done, research has identified several architectural features that appear to be associated with mood and health. Design characteristics or the way space is structured, presence or absence of windows and illumination all appear to affect people. For some features, the relationship to health is indirect (e.g. small, crowded work spaces may result in stress that may in turn affect health) while for other features the relationship to health is more direct (e.g. eye strain from poor lighting, illness from exposure to fumes).",

      "abstract": "Damage, physically and to the psyche is inevitable. This is whether it is caused unconsciously, through consciously malicious intent, thoughtlessness, as collateral or just through a hostile environment or the warring of internal forces. At the group or social level, the last few years have seen much damage in terms of economic recession, climate change, racial inequalities, and domestic violence. The desire to repair follows such damage. The psychoanalytic focus on reparation sees the process as an attempt by a person to repair perceived damage to another or, more precisely, to an internal image of the other—a loved other. Large groups such as organisations and societies also do damage and sometimes acknowledge this and make attempts to repair—perhaps defensively, simply to restore their own reputation, but perhaps from guilt and remorse. This article will invite readers to think about reparation in terms of either fantasied wishfulness, or defensiveness, or its possible restorative capacity. My exploration rests on the premise that damage is always to the system and that both that which damages and that which is damaged suffer. It is in system restoration that hope re-emerges.",

Suddenness also appeared to be more strongly associated with beginnings than with endings of an episode. Thus, statements about sudden beginnings of a career or a relationship were more readily believed to happen ‘by chance’ than ‘not by chance’. But life-changing events did not become more accidental simply by being placed in the beginning of a ‘life chapter’. These studies highlight a central but neglected feature of perceived randomness.",

      "abstract": "The article describes the anti-value concept of gluttony in the humorous discourse of English-language stand-up and situation comedies. The main humorous characteristics of this concept are identified and analyzed. An axiological approach is used for constructing a humorous conceptual framework, because humor is one of the most important tools for forming values and anti-values of a certain culture. The ridiculed characteristics of gluttony are divided into the following two groups: those of process and result. The main characteristics of the process include improper eating of edible items and eating of inedible items. Improper eating of edible items is usually ridiculed through eating excessive amounts of food, eating food under inappropriate conditions, eating incompatible items. Eating of inedible items is mostly ridiculed through eating life-threatening objects, eating something unfit to eat, and eating excrements or other human waste products. The main ridiculed characteristics of the result include gaining excess weight, addiction to a certain food, illness/death of a person. This work also performs a detailed analysis of the anti-value concept of gluttony for the first time. The main linguistic means of representing the anti-value concept of gluttony in stand-up comedies and sitcoms are revealed. This article makes a significant contribution to constructing an axiological humorous framework of the concept, because gluttony is one of the basic anti-values in humorous discourse.",

So, any elements both dietary, environmental or mental which reasons impairment of Agni turn out to be answerable for the formation of Ama also. The Ama is a causative thing for lots ailments such as Amavata1 . Amavata is precipitated on the equal time because the Ama with assist of Vata actions quick and get lodged in Dhamanis and in Kaphasthanas especially Sandhi’s2 . Current case study is carried out at Shri Ayurved Mahavidyalaya Nagpur to evaluate the efficacy of Ayurvedic treatment. A 40 year, female came to O.P.D of Kayachikitsa with chief complaints of Sandhishula at both Hastanguliparvasandhi, Manibandhsandhi, Karpursandhi, Padanguliparvasandhi, Gulf sandhi, Janu sandhi (pain in both Interphalangeal joints of hand, wrist joint, elbow joint, Interphalangeal joints of feet, ankle joint and Knee joint ), Sandhishoth at both Hastanguliparvasandhi, Manibandhsandhi, Karpursandhi, Padanguliparvasandhi, Gulf sandhi, Janu sandhi (pain in both Interphalangeal joints of hand, wrist joint, elbow joint, interphalangeal joints of feet, ankle joint and Knee joint.), Angamarda (body ache), Agni Mandya (loss of digestive fire), Aalasya (lethargy) and Apaka (Indigestion). So, she had taken Ayurvedic treatment for 42 days which include Shodhana, Shamana Chikitsa. Clinical signs have been appreciably reduced. The response to this treatment was recorded and therapeutic effect were evaluated through symptomatic relief.",

      "abstract": "A presupposition of Aquinas's account of evil, of course, is that there are standards regarding what perfections different things ought to have. It would make very little sense, in his view, to talk of good and evil, or of kindred notions like health and unhealth, without such standards. An important implication of Aquinas's account is that evil is always in something good as its subject; or, we might say, evil is parasitic on the good. Since evil is the lack of what something ought to have, it presupposes the something as its subject, and this subject, since it is an actual entity, will, like all actual entities, be good. Recognizing all evil to consist in privation, Aquinas distinguishes two most general categories of evil. A first type involves privations that bear on \"the form and integrity\" of a thing. A second type involves privation in a thing's operation or activity.",

      "abstract": "Play is an important indicator of physical strength, cognitive functioning, and overall welfare for animals. Performed independently or cooperatively, play provides animals, including humans, opportunities to test and practice various physical abilities, social interactions, and object investigations. One area that is often overlooked in animal play is the presence and nature of games. Sometimes considered the social glue of human cultures, games enable participants to practice different moves, cooperatively follow a shared set of rules, and have 'fun.' Using archived footage collected from a stable beluga population in managed care for nearly 15 years, we examined spontaneous, untrained social interactions (i.e. games played) between two or more belugas. Social games encompassed repeated, role exchanges that involved a set of rules developed and shared between the interactants. The belugas engaged in seven different games: locomotor-based games with and without contact, triadic play involving inanimate objects and water, and socio-sexual play. Although most social games involved immature animals, some games did occur with adults. This catalog and description of the variety of games played by belugas will enable us to understand the role social behavior has in behavioral development and individual animal welfare.",

      "title": "Graves and grave-goods",
      "abstract": "It has been stressed that the archaeological remains of the dead in a formal grave represent only the final stage in what may well have been a protracted and complex series of stages in funerary ritual. From this final stage, however, the archaeologist is potentially able to make an informed assessment of several aspects of the prevailing funerary practice, notably: • the context of burial, whether individual, grouped, or collective; • its structure, whether simple pit, with or without coffin, cist, or more elaborate tomb with the provision of additional space for accompaniments; • the placement of the remains, whole or part, cremation or inhumation, in the latter case including factors such as orientation and posture; • the presence or absence of grave-goods, their intrinsic character, and their choreography within the burial area; • any adjacent features, such as remains of pyres or related structures that might reflect pre-depositional stages in funerary ritual; • any secondary episodes of activity, such as subsequent burials or ‘grave robbing’. There is an implicit assumption that cemeteries should be relatively compact groups of graves, with or without a defining enclosure boundary. In the case of a larger cemetery, it might even be possible from grave associations to determine that it expanded over time in one particular direction, as in the case of Wetwang Slack or in the classic instance at Münsingen. Some graves in larger cemeteries were collectively ordered in regular ranks, as at Rudston or Harlyn Bay, implying an informed rather than random pattern of expansion. Smaller burial grounds, however, perhaps used over a shorter period of time, may be dispersed, or in small clusters over a wider area, as at Adanac Park, Cockey Down, Melton, or Little Woodbury, making their recognition more difficult in the absence of widespread stripping. This pattern could arise if a family group, for example, was segregated from the next allowing for infilling over time, which may not have happened if the settlement served by the cemetery for some reason was abandoned. In present-day western society a grave is simply a place of burial, designed for the disposal and commemoration of the dead.",

Studies of prisoners reveal a variety of negative impacts including physiological (headaches, heart palpitations), cognitive (impaired concentration, memory loss), perceptual (hallucinations, paranoia), emotional (depression, anxiety), and motor (lethargy, apathy). This constellation of symptoms is sometimes described as solitary confinement psychosis. It is argued that in addition a variety of positive effects accompany successful adaptation to harsh circumstances. These include clarity of thought, heightened feelings of personal accomplishment, and enhanced status among other prisoners. Not all prisoners are destroyed by prolonged aloneness and there are lessons to be learned from the resilient few. The virtues of solitude include reflection, freedom from the constraints of society, and creativity. But even those who survive (or thrive) are diminished as human beings because the denial of company strikes at the essence of personhood. We need the mirroring effects of others to be fully human.",

      "abstract": "(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.) He does not make gods who sculpts sacred faces into gold or marble; he makes gods who asks of them. The humblest could hiss you at games or piss on your statue. They could kill you. Honour is always a question of ascription, not a matter of fact or individual right.1 That and shame were and (for most part) remain pivotal cultural values in Mediterranean is really beyond question. One can debate fruitfully how and shame work together and independently, and how they work differently in different locations, but there is more than enough evidence to defend proposition that in Mediterranean, past and present, these values remain pivotal.2 The broadly accepted anthropological definition of and shame has been distilled from two sources: observation of human interaction in person3 and ancient literary and epigraphical remains.4 From vast amount of modern ethnographic work and ancient primary sources, Bruce Malina developed a model of and shame that, while criticized,5 has stood test of time. Many scholars of biblical antiquity have benefited from explanatory power of Malina's model, an influence not limited to those affiliated with Context Group.6 This much is admitted in otherwise critical article by F. Gerald Downing.7 Yet, despite obvious strengths of Malina's model, it is starting to show signs of its age and might benefit from some changes that would increase its heuristic power and longevity. It is always good to return periodically to look with fresh eyes at our models and data we use to construct them, and I think we shall be rewarded by doing so here. I. REVIEWING MALINA'S HONOR AND SHAME Malina claimed that concerns of and shame are to be found where authority, gender status, and respect intersect. Authority is ability to control others without force; gender status refers to different standards of acceptable behavior that apply to males and females; respect refers to attitude one ought to have toward those who control your existence (humans, gods, God). Where these three intersect, Malina situates his well-known definition of honor: the value of a person in his or her own eyes (that is, one's claim to worth) plus that person's value in eyes of his or her social group.8 Honor, for Malina (as for Julian Pitt-Rivers and John G. Peristiany before him), relies on claims to from a person and assessment of that claim by a public court of reputation (hereafter PCR). There are two types of honor; Malina calls them ascribed honor and honor. Ascribed is with which one is born: by ethnicity, family reputation, gender, wealth, and so on. This tends to be less dynamic than acquired honor, which can be won and lost on a daily basis through acts of benefaction and agonistic contest of challenge and riposte. Honor cultures are not a unique feature of Mediterranean area. Honor cultures appear also in Japan and South America and within subcultures in nonhonor cultures (e.g., North American sports teams, military and police forces, and gangs). An culture is defined by seriousness with which people who inhabit it protect their and fight to retrieve it if it has been lost. This phenomenon can exist only in concert with perception that access to is limited. If there were enough to go around, losing a little here and there would carry no consequences. This is an important distinction to draw, for it is also what distinguishes and shame cultures from non-honor and shame cultures: a non-honor and shame culture might well know and shame, but it does not see as a limited good and thus does not contest it with same intensity. It is Malina's understanding of challenge and riposte contest that will be focus of my critique of his model. …",

We either do not realize the significance of this plant at that place, or the signal embodied in its appearance does not make sense to us. In some places we have disturbed the environment so much that ‘undesirable’ plants find it more convenient to grow there than the ‘desirable’ plants.

      "title": "Estimation by Associations and Trends",
      "abstract": "Product engineers are often challenged to estimate: 1. the properties of new or obscure classes of material that have not been extensively studied before, or have never been made before; 2. the property changes on a material due to physical and chemical modifications; 3. the properties under a variety of ambient conditions, such as temperatures, pressures, electromagnetic fields, and prolonged environmental exposures and weathering. When theoretical understanding is insufficient and quantitative correlations are not available, we can often make useful qualitative estimations by using fragmentary empirical structure–property relations. The principal tools are observations of associations and trends, which are often the only methods available in biological, health, safety, and environmental properties. Association is based on analogy, or the probabilistic assumption that “similar substances have similar properties.” Does x◦, the material in question, resemble a known substance x1 or a class of substances {x1, x2, . . ., xi , . . .} that have known properties and structure? If we can find such a match, then we can use it to make qualitative property estimates for x◦.We know that metals are nearly always solids at room temperature, but mercury is an exception. Trend is based on the study of the variation of properties among the substances {x1, x2, . . ., xi, . . .} and how they depend on structure variations, which amounts to qualitative and empirical structure–property relations. For example, we know that a larger molecule tends to have higher melting and boiling points, but chlorobenzene has lower melting point than benzene. Thomas Midgley used qualitative trend analysis to help him to discover the chlorofluorocarbons as refrigerants. He did not have a well-organized database, nor did he have an established method of analysis and prediction, and his method was ad hoc and empirical. What he did know was that sulfur dioxide and ammonia were in use as refrigerants. He looked at the periodic table of nonmetallic elements and observed the trend that small compounds of these elements tend to become less flammable when we move from the left to the right of the table, which is certainly true in the sequence CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF.",

      "title": "Neural Art: Works Based on Concepts of the Nervous System",
      "abstract": "My work, which I call neural art, is based on a scientific understanding of the nervous system. Neural art combines my interests and professional training in art and physiological psychology. I began developing these ideas about twelve years ago while I was both painting and practicing psychology. I felt that there were new problems to be solved, and I wanted to achieve a personal integration of my activities. In line with most physiological psychologists, I started by assuming that our artistically related experiences, like all experiences, are the result of neural activity but, unlike other experiences, are generated by art objects in the environment [1]. Furthermore, it seemed that this activity of the nervous system is essential to art, or at least is significant. In moving from these assumptions to actual works of art, I considered a number of approaches. The approach I chose to develop actively involves selecting certain features or characteristics of the nervous system as the basis for my art work, in the way many artists select features of their experience or environment as material for their art. For example, a painter of still life first selects the objects to be portrayed-apples, tin cans, dead fish, or silk purses. Most artists then try to convey the objects' underlying essence, using color, form, and space. Instead of selecting objects, I select aspects of the nervous system as the elements of my art. These aspects are tangible elements as well as conceptualizations of the way the nervous system functions. This approach is based in part on ideas developed by C. H. Waddington [2], who pointed out striking similarities in structure and form between twentieth-century painting and the natural sciences. For example, he suggested that the major concern of modern physicists probing the underlying structure of matter is similar to modern abstract artists' 'retreat from likeness', probing the underlying structure of reality. At another level, he showed the parallel between the extradimensionality of relativity theory in physics and of cubism in art. These and other examples of formal features common to art and the natural sciences suggested that I could self-consciously take certain properties in science and use them to develop a specific art form. This is what I have attempted in my work, using the nervous system as the scientific starting point. To identify and develop these features, I began by defining a nervous system conceptually and by stripping away, as much as possible, the specifics of ion flow and detailed molecular structure. Using this approach, a nervous system can be defined in either structural terms (anatomy) or functional terms",

The initial judgment plants the germ in Inventive mode. Causing the judgment to increase in consequence and extent makes it grow in Creative mode. Giving the judgment the air of publicity makes something new of it in Productive and co-Productive mode. Making a mistake triggers a whole series of making processes, and our language reflects this. The dominance of ‘making’ language in relation to individual errors and collective responses to those errors indicates that in social contexts an individual’s fracture of the social fabric is more than made up for by the fabricating impulses of society at large. The clustering of criticism operates in this sense almost like the cells of a body that rush to heal cuts in skin and breakages of bone – sometimes leaving the re-created tissue stronger than it was to begin with. On the other hand, where judgments are made hypocritically, too quickly, or with an inadequate grasp of the materials, the Product can be as shoddy as the original infraction.",

Mediterranean diet fits on these two concepts. The question is if we are measuring Mediterranean diet as a whole, or whether we are only measuring one of its parts, neglecting the rest of components. Can this compromise the way we monitor its adherence and evolution, with the possibility of losing the perception of certain aspects? How can we preserve and promote the concept if we do not monitor all the pieces of the puzzle?",

Entities are identifiable and distinguishable existing things of the real world. In general the concept of entity, is used only for static things whose existence does not depend directly from other entities, in contrast to the dynamic happenings called events and the existence of some dependency between two or more entities called relationship (or attribute or property) which can exist only in conjunction with the related entities. More complex combinations of entities, relationships and events we call facts . Therefore “ John has broken his leg yesterday and is in Santa Clara Hospital ” is a fact which combines the event of “ breaking a leg ” occurred with the entity “ leg of John ” at time-event “ yesterday ” and the relationship “ is in ” valid between “ John ” and “ Santa Clara Hospital ” now.

      "title": "Suggestions for the Blind and their Friends",
      "abstract": "The following suggestions have been offered by men and women from different parts of the United States who have worked with and for the blind for many years. Most of the suggestions have come from those who are themselves blind. Some may be of little value to you and with others you may not agree. One of those who offered some of the suggestions said, “It takes a wise head to know the when-ness and the where-ness of all these things.” Remember that there are two classes of blind adults; those to whom the loss of sight is the only handicap, and those in whom the cause which produced blindness has also produced other physical disabilities. Unfortunately there are many in the latter group, and this makes the problem of the newly-blinded adult very difficult. Blindness with a strong body and mind unimpaired is one thing; blindness plus shattered nerves, a weakened body and serious physical ailments is quite another matter. The first step should be to eliminate the handicaps other than blindness and help the man or woman to be as nearly normal as possible. Inspire in him courage and confidence in himself. He must have confidence in himself before the world will have confidence in him. Encourage him, so far as it is practical, to follow the same pursuits he followed with sight, for this work he knows how to do. Compel him, if necessary, to exercise and show him how failing in this he simply adds to his physical disabilities, but do not fail to provide some way by which he may exercise. Remove if possible the feeling of loneliness and aloneness which comes with blindness and show him that he has friends and give him something to do, even though it be of little value in itself. Inasmuch as a person's self-respect depends in considerable measure upon his ability for self-support, the blind should be helped to find or to prepare themselves for some remunerative employment. “In dealing with a patient,” writes an occulist of national reputation, “one should always tell the truth. It is neither necessary nor wise in every case to tell the whole truth to the sufferer. Pandora left her best gift in the box, when the others flew away;— but it is imperative that the relatives or near friends should know the exact facts. Lack of frankness causes loss of confidence, and in desperation the poor man who feels the night settling about him flies from one to another in the vain hope of finding a way of escape. If the reputable and dependable oculist fails to enlighten him as to his future he siezes upon the unwarrantable encouragement offered by the unscrupulous and ignorant quack, immensely increasing his disappointment and unhappiness when the inevitable blindness comes. He should have a reasonable time to prepare himself to meet the new conditions under which he must live, and then, more than ever in his life he needs the encouragement and support of those who can make him realize that all is not necessarily lost,—because he must use other means than those to which he has been accustomed to bring him in touch with the world. “Usually the man for whom blindness is imminent knows nothing of the blind, their possibilities, or their achievements. He very naturally thinks that when his eyes are shut all avenues are closed. Let those who know what can be done without sight, be his good angels during this period of discouragement and dismay. Let them bring to his knowledge the biographies of successful blind men and women, not alone those who were eminent and gifted like Milton or Fawcett, or Senator Gore, but those like himself if he is of ordinary ability and intelligence, who have fought their way cheerfully through life, in the dark, and have achieved contentment at least, if not happiness, which is the gift of the gods reserved for few. Let him be buoyed up over the danger period and he will have the courage to face life under the new conditions and not weakly to throw it away like a child terrified by present limitations, as Dick did in the ‘Light that Failed.”’",

      "abstract": "Your brain is always thinking of something. Even now your brain is thinking of something. Ten seconds later it is thinking of something and 20 s later it is thinking of something. The brain is always thinking continuously. Note that the brain is consuming a large amount of energy to allow the brain to think continuously. Please imagine that you cannot think continuously and how your daily is. Ten seconds later you may forget what you are thinking of. Specifically speaking, you have experienced having forgotten what you are going to do when you go upstairs. Everybody has ever done this and of course I have. However, you must have serious trouble in your daily life if you always forget what you were thinking of 10 s before. The human brain distinguishes between the past, the present, and the future and allows you to think continuously. As you get older, the brain does not allow you to think continuously, and your thinking becomes non-continuous. When this gets worse, you have lost the past and the future and you are in the present. You may be diagnosed with dementia. The brain being continuous is highly related to the energy problem that I stated in Chap. 2 . This is because the human brain is consuming a large amount of energy to allow you to think continuously. The energy problem of the brain is highly related to the issue of how people are living in the super-aging society, which the USA, Europe, and Japan are now facing. No one likes to get dementia, and anybody wishes his or her family not to get dementia. This is why we are discussing with each other and can get to a better way to fact dementia without fear by letting the public know about the brain energy problem. In this chapter, we pursue a possible way to protect the brain, especially the hippocampus which manages short-term memory, and the neocortex which controls long-term memory.",

      "abstract": "Until the XVIth century, the notion of interest is nearly non existent in the representations of the world and of action. From the XVIth century and during all the XVIIth, it enlarges its uses as far as it becomes the notion we can't avoid nor refute nowadays. Through the study of its most important promoters, from Guichardin to Leibniz, and assuming that its introduction provides a solution that enables them to work out new problems they have to face, this work shows that the notion of interest is not a psychological motivation that would lead to the representation of a selfish man nor to the mere introduction of the utilitarian paradigm. The analysis of its uses (whether it's used to solve economic, moral or political problems), of its objects and subjects, of its qualities (either descriptive or normative, either particular or general) and of its ambivalent effects (utility, prejudice), enables to show that its stake is wider, in so far as the modelling of the reality is concerned. Interest works as a principle of action, as a corrective variable. It allows to get the phenomenons under control, to get a phenomenal representation of the relationships between the man and his world around. Its extension leads to an upgrading of tangible world, that gives the representation of value a new start, and appraises them throughout concurrence. Therefore, it takes part in the construction of modernity.",

      "title": "When Out of Sight is Out of Mind: Perceiving Object Persistence Through Occlusion vs. Implosion",
      "abstract": "The visual system must not only segment scenes into discrete objects, but also track objects over time, motion, and occlusion as the same persisting individuals. Here we explore how this is accomplished in a multiple-object tracking task where the objects are intermittently invisible. Subjects attentionally tracked 4 target objects as they moved unpredictably for 10 seconds in a field of 4 featurally-identical moving distractors. Previous research (Scholl & Pylyshyn, 1999) demonstrated that tracking is unimpaired by occlusion, but is radically impaired when objects disappear and reappear in ways which do not implicate the presence of an occluding surface (e.g. by imploding and exploding into and out of existence). However, this research never determined whether the impairment was caused by the ‘explosion’ (due to attentional capture from onsetting looming objects) or ‘implosion’ (which signalled that the objects ceased to exist). Here we explored these options in several ways. We first showed that when targets behave in ‘object-consistent’ ways but additional distractors implode and explode, subjects' performance is unimpaired. This suggests that the behavior of the targets, rather than that of the distractors, is critical. A second experiment asked whether impairment was due to target implosion or target explosion by having all objects approach an occluder in one way and depart in a different way. Performance with implosion followed by disocclusion was significantly worse than with occlusion followed by explosion. These results argue against an attentional-capture account, and suggest that implosion cues cause the corresponding ‘object files’ in mid-level vision to be discarded — whereas occlusion cues cause object files to be preserved. Following Gibson, we conclude that the visual system — and attentional tracking in particular — uses occlusion to infer that objects are merely going out of sight, and implosion to infer that objects are going out of existence.",

      "title": "On the Meaning(s) of Perceived Complexity in the Chemical Senses",
      "abstract": "Complexity is a term that is often invoked by those writing appreciatively about the taste, aroma/bouquet, and/or flavor of food and drink. Typically, the term is used as though everyone knows what is being talked about. Rarely is any explanation given, and the discussion soon moves on to other topics. However, oftentimes it is not at all clear what, exactly, is being referred to. A number of possibilities are outlined here, including physical complexity at the level of individual molecules, at the level of combinations of molecules giving rise to a specific flavor profile (e.g., as in a glass of quality wine or a cup of specialty coffee), at the level of combinations of distinct ingredients/elements (e.g., as when composing a particularly intricate dish in a high-end restaurant, say, or when pairing food with wine), and/or the number of stimuli/steps involved in the process of creation. Of course, people might also be referring to some aspect of their perceptual experience, and one of the intriguing questions in this space concerns the nature of the relationship(s) between these different ways of conceptualizing complexity in the chemical senses. However, given that physical/chemical and perceived complexity so often diverge, we argue that it is the latter notion, or rather inferred complexity, that is the most relevant when it comes to the chemical senses. Finally, we look at the role of expertise and review the evidence suggesting that inferred complexity can emerge either from a unitary taste experience that is judged to be complex, or from a tasting experience having multiple individuable elements.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to come to an understanding of the human being in the Old Testament by analyzing the biblical texts which refer to human beauty. In the Hebrew thinking, a human being is understood as a whole, which implies both soul and body. The description of physical beauty in the Old Testament shows the importance of the nature of a person as a being created in the image of God. Research into the texts that use the Hebrew words like yafah, tob and barii, meaning beautiful, handsome and good lets us know the meaning and function of human beauty in the Old Testament. The beauty mentioned in the Old Testament is more external and physical than internal and spiritual. It is used as an important standard with which to value a person and acts as a motivational power or a crucial precondition of major events. The beautiful appearance of a man is, in general, closely connected to political power, as in the case of David and Absalom. On the other hand, the beautiful appearance of a woman tends to motivate a rape or sexual violation, as in the case of Bathsheba and Tamar. The physical beauty may also be used to save one`s life, either individual or national, and that is a messianic role, as in the case of Moses and Esther. The beauty referenced in the Old Testament is a means for human to take part in the salvation history of God.",

Humans have a natural tendency trying to take control and own property as much as possible. In a hadith of the Prophet, explained that the man was not satisfied with his wealth despite a valley-shaped gold so that he died. In fact, al-Quran and al- Sunnah forcefully argued that the property should not move from one person to another, but in a way that justified by syarak namely through trades or transactions based on consensual. The use of property in Islam should always be in the service of God and utilized in order taqarrub (closer) to Allah. Utilization of personal property must not only for the owner’s personal possessions, but also used for social functions in order to help fellow human beings. Islam has given special attention to the property in terms of both how to obtain and use that property owned it has a value of worship with Allah in order to achieve a happier life in the hereafter. A Muslim is commanded to make a living and generate wealth by striving mightily. Islam has given special attention to the property in terms of both ways. How actually the concept of property in Islam, then the following study will explain it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keywords: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidden Existence, Ownership, Happiness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manusia memiliki fitrah berupaya untuk menguasai dan memiliki harta sebanyak mungkin. Dalam sebuah hadith Rasulullah saw., dijelaskan bahwa manusia itu tidak akan puas dengan hartanya walaupun berbentuk satu lembah emas sehingga dia mati. Malahan al-Quran dan al-Sunnah dengan tegas menjelaskan bahwa harta tidak boleh berpindah milik dari seorang kepada orang yang lain melainkan dengan cara yang dibenarkan oleh syarak yaitu melalu perdagangan atau transaksi yang didasari atas suka sama suka. Penggunaan harta dalam ajaran Islam harus senantiasa dalam pengabdian kepada Allah dan dimanfaatkan dalam rangka taqarrub (mendekatkan diri) kepada Allah. Pemanfaatan harta pribadi tidak boleh hanya untuk pribadi pemilik harta, melainkan juga digunakan untuk fungsi sosial dalam rangka membantu sesama manusia. Islam telah memberikan perhatian khusus terhadap harta baik dari segi cara mendapatkannya maupun penggunaannya sehingga harta yang dimiliki itu mempunyai nilai ibadah di sisi Allah dalam rangka pencapaian kehidupan yang lebih bahagia di akhirat. Seorang Muslim diperintahkan untuk mencari nafkah dan menghasilkan harta dengan berjuang sekuat tenaga. Islam telah memberikan perhatian khusus terhadap harta baik dari segi cara Bagaimanakah sebetulnya konsep harta dalam Islam, maka kajian berikut akan menjelaskannya.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;k&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ata &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kunci: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eksistensi Harta, Kepemilikan, kebahagiaan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "(26.) The first thing impressed on us from our earliest infancy is, that events do not succeed one another at random, but with a certain degree of order, regularity, and connection; — some constantly, and, as we are apt to think, immutably, — as the alternation of day and night, summer and winter, — others contingently, as the motion of a body from its place, if pushed, or the burning of a stick if thrust into the fire. The knowledge that the former class of events has gone on, uninterruptedly, for ages beyond all memory, impresses us with a strong expectation that it will continue to do so in the same manner; and thus our notion of an order of nature is originated and confirmed. If every thing were equally regular and periodical, and the succession of events liable to no change depending on our own will, it may be doubted whether we should ever think of looking for causes. No one regards the night as the cause of the day, or the day of night. They are alternate effects of a common cause, which their regular succession alone gives us no sufficient clue for determining. It is chiefly, perhaps entirely, from the other or contingent class of events that we gain our notions of cause and effect. From them alone we gather that there are such things as laws of nature.",

At one time it may seem to him that he should live—even that a man should live —in such-and-such a way; at another that the only truly satisfactory form of life is something totally different, incompatible with the first. In this way, his outlook may vary radically, not only at different periods of his life, but from day to day, even from one hour to the next. It is a function of so many variables: age, experiences, present environment, current reading, current physical state are some of them. As for the ways of life that may thus present themselves at different times as each uniquely satisfactory, there can be no doubt about their variety and opposition. The ideas of self-obliterating devotion to duty or to the service of others; of personal honour and magnanimity; of asceticism, contemplation, retreat; of action, dominance and power; of the cultivation of “an exquisite sense of the luxurious”; of simple human solidarity and co-operative endeavour; of a refined complexity of social existence; of a constantly maintained and renewed affinity with natural things—any of these ideas, and a great many others too, may form the core and substance of a personal ideal.",

The Noble Eight-fold Path (ariya atthakgika magga) is a way to the cessation of suffering by \"rightly\" engaging in ordinary human activities such as speech, action, and livelihood.

Does the Divine Substance Necessarily Exist? SH 1, P1, In1, Tr1, Q1, C1 (n. 25), 40-42To demonstrate the first point [that the divine substance necessarily exists], many arguments are brought forward in accordance with different ways of thinking about the divine essence.I. In the book On the Trinity [1.6],Richard of St. Victor proves that God exists through the notion of being or existence, by proposing this distinction: \"everything that exists or is able to exist either has its being from eternity or began to be in time.Similarly, all that exists or is able to exist either has being from itself, or from something other than itself.Therefore, there is a threefold way of distinguishing between all forms of existence.For each thing that exists has being either from eternity and from itself; or, on the contrary, neither from eternity nor from itself; or mediately between these two, from eternity, but nevertheless not from itself.However, a fourth way of being, which seems to respond to this [last option] as its contrary, is absolutely impossible by nature, for absolutely nothing is able to exist from itself, but not from eternity.For there was a time when all that began to exist in time did not exist.But as long as it did not exist, it possessed absolutely nothing and was capable of absolutely nothing.Thus, it did not give being nor the ability to do something to itself or to anything else, otherwise, it [would have] given what it did not have and made what it was not able to make.\"It remains, therefore, that if something exists in time, it is not from itself, but from another.Therefore, the faulty consequence shows that if something is from itself, it is not from time but from eternity; therefore, the fourth",

      "abstract": "Marie-Benoît Bernard, O.C.S.O. 216 THE SACRED ART OF LOVE Marie-Benoît Bernard, O.C.S.O. \"Yes, it is good, it is sweet for brothers [and sisters] to live together and to be united\" (Ps 133). \"Then he returned to the place of his beloved solitude, and alone, under the eye of the Onlooker from above, he dwelt with himself.\" (Gregory the Great, Dial. II.III.5).1 INTRODUCTION RB 52 focuses on the oratory,2 the particular place in the monastery where we come to pray the psalms with our brothers or sisters in choir at specific times each day and, at other times, to engage in personal prayer, experiencing a \"heart-to-heart\" or intimate solitude with God. In this chapter Saint Benedict is not content to simply describe the oratory, enumerate more practices or customs (a list of \"tools of good works\" [RB 4]), prescribe actions and gestures, or influence inner disposition. Rather, with much simplicity and in very few words, as if creating a space of silence and freedom between each recommendation, he teaches an \"art of living together\" in the oratory, the sacred living space par excellence. This art engages the freedom of each of us in vibrant, peaceful and ardent prayer of the heart (in common and in solitude) to develop an authentic and profound relationship with God. This experience leads to God establishing his dwelling in us which establishes us in him and in his peace. In this sense, prayer according to Saint Benedict also appears to be a sort of \"sacred art of love.\" More particularly it is the art of exercising freedom, an art by which the Holy Spirit acts, works, and constructs a peace in the depth of our hearts that is the guardian of unity and sentinel and awakener of fraternal communion: Marie-Benoît Bernard, O.C.S.O. is a nun of Abbaye Sainte Marie du Rivet, Auros, France. This article first appeared in Collectanea Cisterciensia 72 (2010), 28–39. It is translated by Colleen Maura McGrane, O.S.B., Benedictine Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, Clyde, MO. 1 Gregory the Great and Adalbert de Vogüé, The Life of St. Benedict (Petersham, MA: St. Bede's, 1993). 2 Translators note: Throughout this article the word \"oratory\" will be used to designate the sacred space where monks and sisters gather to pray. Some communities may refer to this space as the \"chapel\" or \"church.\" 217 ABR 71:2 – JUNE 2020 The oratory must be what its name says: a place of prayer. Nothing else must be done in this place except prayer and only what is useful for prayer should be kept there. When the service of God is concluded, all should leave in a profound silence, with great reverence for God. Thus, when one brother wishes to remain to pray alone, the others must not disturb him. And when, at another time, a monk wishes to pray in the secret of his heart, he should simply enter and pray. He should not pray in a loud voice but wholeheartedly with tears. The monk who does not pray in this manner will not be permitted to remain in the oratory after the service of God, as we have said. Thus, he will not disturb another brother (RB 52).3 THE TEACHING OF SAINT BENEDICT ON PRAYER Woven into the description of the oratory, the teaching of Saint Benedict on prayer gets to the heart of the matter. It highlights the defining traits of monastic prayer, which are nothing other than reflections of the duties of monastic life, of profession and the vow of obedience. Prayer implies a conversion of heart and life. It is a grace of profound listening, attentiveness to others and to the presence of God.4 It is a state of mind and a stance of vigilance, the sign of the awakening of life itself. Those who pray are none other than the blessed sentinels who draw their inner lives as close as possible to the God who lives in the depths of their hearts. That is why Saint Benedict references certain qualities5 that monks must possess, just as the...",

I argue that we may have different obligations to assist wild and domesticated animals because they have different morally-relevant relationships with us. I explain how different approaches to animal ethics, which, for simplicity, I call capacity-oriented and context-oriented, address questions about animal assistance differently. I then defend a broadly context-oriented approach, on which we have special obligations to assist animals that we have made vulnerable to or dependent on us. This means that we should normally help suffering domesticated animals, but that we lack general obligations to assist wild animals, since we are not responsible for their vulnerability. However, we may have special obligations to help wild animals where we have made them vulnerable to or dependent on us (by habitat destruction or by captivity, for instance). I consider some obvious difficulties with this context-oriented approach, and I conclude by looking more closely at the question whether we should intervene, if we could do so successfully, to reduce wild animal suffering by reducing predation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There seems to be no construction that would code specifically the possession relation of external possessors. Instead, various host constructions such as the free-affectee construction (a subtype of which is the free-dative construction), monotransitive or applicative construction can – to a different degree – accommodate participants that are bound by a possession relation. The binding procedure identifying the possessor operates at the pragmatic-semantic interface and takes into account the semantic roles of the event participants, their discourse saliency and lexical properties (such as animacy), world knowledge, properties of the possessum (such as the degree of (in)alienability), etc. The external-possession relation and the meaning of the hosting construction are orthogonal to each other, but there is a strong interplay between them. Positing a dedicated external-possessor construction faces the following problems: the same binding procedure is found in other constructions as well (such as the monotransitive or ditransitive constructions); at the same time, the very possession relation is only inconsistently found in constructions referred to as external-possessor constructions, and, what is more, the possession relation may sometimes be canceled (even if it is inalienable). To account for this terminologically, I introduce the term non-thematic affectee construction , a subtype of which is the free (non-thematic) affectee construction particularly spread in European languages. The latter is found with different types of coding (accusative, dative, different prepositional phrases) which have different diachronic sources.",

Moreover, there is a distinct social aspect of any creative work: a creator makes his wonders for other people (and here he reminds Danko by Gorkiy sometimes), the person who destructs, realizes himself in his own eyes and for himself only, he works for his self-appraisal. Negative creation appears when this process is valued on the results of the changes it brought in the world. In this case, there is no difference to take or to give. The person who wants to strengthen himself can create but at the same time he can destruct: everybody realizes himself in his own way.

      "abstract": "Abstract To summarize, the first process of digestion and, thereby, of nutrition takes place in the The food mass is broken down into smaller parts by the mechanical action of the teeth to permit easier attack by the digestive juices, including the saliva. The act of chewing is part voluntary and part reflex. The person wills to chew, but the power of the chewing stroke is determined by neuromuscular tonus and the condition of the dental tissues. The pressure that is exerted and the extent of the chewing stroke is a reflex act determined by the character of the food bolus and the presence or the absence of dental pain or discomfort. If the first step in digestion, namely, the mechanical preparation of the bolus, is inadequate it is conceivable that the succeeding steps in digestion will suffer. The chewing of palatable food stimulates the flow of gastric juice. In the case of the aged, inadequate mechanical preparation of the food results from painful, nonfunctioning, or missing teeth, or from unsatisfactory dentures. When mechanical preparation is difficult or painful, the person begins to select foods to conserve effort or to diminish pain. By this pernicious process of self-selection he may gradually drift into the state of malnutrition. An opportunity is open for a piece of enterprising research on the application of gerontology to the dental problem. Without adequate nutrition the aged patient cannot long edure. Adequate nutrition is impossible in the face of disturbance along the digestive tract. The mouth is the beginning of the digestive system. Its structures and functions have long been neglected in the consideration of the nutritional problems of all ages. The French have told us that death enters through the mouth. We might likewise say that so, too, do life, and health, and long well-being.",

The sense of visual is the amulet consists of picture or sentence. The sense of touch is the method to have objects to defeat the evil. The sense of smell is the method to smell incense or smoke. The sense of taste is to take things to defeat the evil.

      "title": "Science of Odor as a Potential Health Issue",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Historically, unpleasant odors have been considered warning signs or indicators of potential risks to human health but not necessarily direct triggers of health effects. However, citizen complaints to public health agencies suggest that odors may not simply serve as a warning of potential risks but that odor sensations themselves may cause health symptoms. Malodors emitted from large animal production facilities and wastewater treatment plants, for example, elicit complaints of eye, nose, and throat irritation, headache, nausea, diarrhea, hoarseness, sore throat, cough, chest tightness, nasal congestion, palpitations, shortness of breath, stress, drowsiness, and alterations in mood. There are at least three mechanisms by which ambient odors may produce health symptoms. First, symptoms can be induced by exposure to odorants (compounds with odor properties) at levels that also cause irritation or other toxicological effects. That is, irritation—rather than the odor—is the cause of the health symptoms, and odor (the sensation) simply serves as an exposure marker. Second, health symptoms from odorants at nonirritant concentrations can be due to innate (genetically coded) or learned aversions. Third, symptoms may be due to a copollutant (such as endotoxin) that is part of an odorant mixture. Objective biomarkers of health symptoms must be obtained, however, to determine if health complaints constitute health effects. One industry that is receiving much attention, worldwide, related to this subject is concentrated animal production agriculture. Sustainability of this industry will likely necessitate the development of new technologies to mitigate odorous aerial emissions. Examples of such “environmentally superior technologies” (EST) developed under the initiative sponsored through agreements between the Attorney General of North Carolina and Smithfield Foods and Premium Standard Farms are described.",

      "abstract": "In the broad sense of the term, the common objective of forensic engineering is to diagnose problems and remedy them, making the structure sound and serviceable. In the literal sense of the term, the primary objective of forensic engineering is to identify the source of the noted problem and assign responsibility for the failure. The practice of forensic engineering, in both the general and literal sense, likely began shortly after the first man-made structures were completed. In the Code written in 1780 B.C.E. (before Common Era) by Hammurabi, the ruler of Babylon, it states \"If a builder builds a house for some one, and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built falls in and kills its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.\" Clearly, the need to determine the causes of building failures is a longstanding one with serious, sometimes dire, consequences. In daily practice, the forensic engineer's understanding of design and detailing practices, material properties, investigative techniques and construction practices dictate his or her ability to comprehend and properly diagnose problems. This paper is directed to engineering education administrators, instructors and those with a general interest in the current state of forensic engineering education. A review of civil engineering, architectural engineering and architecture coursework offered at twenty-one (21) universities, coupled with an evaluation of recent graduates into the practice, has led to a conclusion that forensic engineering education is limited in offering, narrow in focus and concentrates upon the dramatic collapse rather than the routine failures that are encountered in daily practice. An outline is provided for a comprehensive curriculum, intended to introduce the subjects that most often pertain to a forensic engineer's daily practice. This paper presents a new methodology in the instruction of forensic engineering: one that exposes engineers to architectural components and details, and suggests that universities allow architects (and architectural engineering) students to expose themselves to structural details and material sciences.",

      "title": "Computational analysis of mannerism gestures",
      "abstract": "Humans perform various gestures in everyday life. While some of these gestures are typically well understood amongst a community (such as \"hello\" and \"goodbye\"), many gestures and movement are typical of an individual's style, body language or mannerisms. Examples of such gestures include the manner is which a person laughs, hand gestures used to converse or the manner in which a person performs a dance sequence. Individuals possess a large vocabulary of mannerism gestures. Conventional modeling of gestures as a series of poses for the purpose of automatically recognizing gestures is inadequate for modeling mannerism gestures. In this paper we propose a novel method to model mannerism gestures. Gestures are modeled as a sequence of events that take place within the segments and the joints of the human body. Each gesture is then represented in an event-driven coupled hidden Markov model (HMM) as a sequence of events, occurring in the various segments and joints. The inherent advantage of using an event-driven coupled-HMM (instead of a pose-driven HMM) is that there is no need to add states to represent more complex gestures or increase the states for addition of another individual. When this model was tested on a library of 185 gestures, created by 7 subjects, the algorithm achieved an average recognition accuracy of 90.2%.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It may be possible, now or in the future, for humans to technologically intervene to reduce the amount of suffering experienced by wild animals. There is a debate about whether, if humans can do this, they should. Here, I consider the implications for this debate of the theological claim that humans have been granted dominion over the other animals. I argue that it's more plausible to interpret the dominion claim as granting humans (i) the responsibility to care for the well-being of individual animals than to interpret it as giving humans either (ii) the right to do whatever they want to other animals or (iii) the responsibility to care only for the well-being of aggregates of animals (such as whole species). I then show how this understanding of dominion undermines a range of arguments against intervening to reduce wild animal suffering. These arguments claim that humans do not stand in the right sort of relationship for intervention to be obligatory (or perhaps even permissible). But if we possess such dominion, we do stand in the right sort of relationship for it to be obligatory.",

      "title": "Ayurvedic Understanding of COVID-19 Pandemic and its Management.",
      "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic is not absolutely unexpected and is of sudden occurrence. Nature has warned us several times in the form of calamities, disasters, and several diseases but we have never taken care of it. If we all would have taken care, we might have not been  haunted by this horrible pandemic. Ayurveda describes  causes behind the epidemics/pandemics and measures to get rid of them. Adharma( anti nature and unethical behaviour) is mentioned as the cause of  such problems which again is resulted due to prajnāparādha (volitional transgression). Prajnāparādha  is an inappropriate application of intelligence or decisive faculty. Adharma then results in abhiśāpa (curse) and abhicāra (tantric practices or black magic). Abhicāra may be understood as malicious practices to produce harmful  chemical, biological or other types of weapons. Because of Adharma, the support from devatās ( pro-human celestial or divine forces) is lost, which results in environmental disturbances. (Caraka saṃhitā, vimānasthāna 3/20). The cosmic immunity is disturbed, as a result anti-human forces and creatures get opportunity to produce natural calamities such as epidemics (Janpadoddhvaṃsa). In Caraka Saṃhitā the description is limited to a janapda (nation) but when  same phenomenon happens globally then it is pandemic which may be named as  jagaduddhvaṃsa in Sanskrit.  It  is mentioned that improper positioning  of nakṣatra (stars), graha (astrological planets), Candra (moon) and  Sūrya (sun);inappropriate changes in quality and movement of wind and abnormal qualities in the seasons  are indicators of upcoming epidemic or pandemic (Caraka samhitā, vimāna Sthāna 3/4). Suśruta saṃhitā  adds the role of kṛtyā, abhiśāpa, rakṣaḥkrodha. (Su. sū. 6/19). Abhiśāpa is displeasure of divine forces as discussed earlier which results in loss of support of celestial forces. Usually, devatās or deities  are natural forces that support us but do not take back anything like sun, water, wind, and earth. These natural forces favor us but if we indulge in adharma then their favour is withdrawn. \r\nBy review of Ayurvedic Classical literature, clinical observations on incidences, prevalence, peoples’ reactions, claims and discussion with scientists it can be concluded that Ayurveda helps in understanding  covid-19 clearly and also its absolute management. Promotion of Ayurvedic principles of svasthavṛtta, sadvṛtta,  learning to survive using the minimum available resources, protecting nature by avoiding misuse of its valuable gifts, promotion of holistic approach, promotion of rasāyana, promotion of periodic śodhana is needed to prevent, control and treat the covid-19 and also to manage similar happenings in future.",

      "abstract": "Is God morally good? Is he morally bad? Confronted by the reality of evil his defenders have sometimes said that he is morally good, or, at least, that there is insufficient proof of his moral badness. Why? Because, so they say, the following argument is acceptable: 1 In creating, God brings about or allows various evils. 2 These evils are justified since they go along with some good or goods which depend on them in some way. 3 Evil can therefore be seen as part of God’s justified plan in creating or allowing for certain goods. But does it make sense to say either that God is morally good or that he is not ? This is the question I raised at the end of my previous article on God and Evil. Many people would find it odd, or even offensive, They would say that since God is good, he is bound by moral requirements in the way that human beings are, that the goodness of God is moral goodness, where that is understood in the same way as it is when ascribed to men and women. Richard Swinburne is a good representative of this view. God, he says, is perfectly good. What does this mean? It means, says Swinburne, that God knows which actions are morally good and which actions are morally bad, and that God always does actions which are morally good and never does actions which are morally bad. According to Swinburne, ‘God’s perfect goodness follows deductively from his omniscience and his perfect freedom’. Since God is omniscient he will ‘know the truth value of all moral judgments whether or not they are true or false’. Since he is perfectly free he ‘will always do any action which he recognizes to be over all better to do than not to do, and so one which he judges to be morally obligatory’.",

Well-being or welfare is a general term for the condition of an individual or group, for example their social, economic. Psychological, spiritual or medical state: high well being means that, in some sense, the individual’s or group’s experience is positive while low well- being is associated with negative happenings. Well-being is equated with the experience of pleasure and the absence of pain over time. The less psychological pain an individual is experiencing the more he or she is going to expenence well-being. When someone is experiencing positive well-being they are also experiencing a few other things. It involves a sense of self-fulfilment, which is the feeling of being happy and one is doing something that fully uses your abilities and talents. The feeling of having a purpose in life and connection with others are also contributors to the idea of well-being when people feel as though they have a purpose in the world they feel like they belong. They feel like they matter and it goes back to be idea that we were created for and by a purpose. Mental Health Week in 2015 has drawn attention to a new evidence-based research study that focuses on workers in the entertainment industry. The report found that entertainment industry workers are at a higher risk of experiencing a mental health problem than the rest of the general population. Because of the lifestyle and the hours that people in the entertainment industry actually work, their ability to access mental health services suffers. There is significant difference in the general well-being among male and female students in the field of performing arts. It means that the general well-being of male students is better than that of female students in the field of performing arts. It implies that there is greater negativity, anxiety and frustration among the female students. There is greater stress, depression and competitiveness amongst them affecting their general well being.",

      "title": "What’s in a Name?",
      "abstract": "What’s in a Name? Jeffrey R. Di Leo (bio) Juliet had a big problem. Her boyfriend had the wrong name. Infamously, she tried to explain it away. “‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy,” she said to Romeo. “It is nor hand, nor foot, / Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part / Belonging to a man,” continued the Bard’s young lover. The French philosopher, Jacques Derrida, glosses this line from Juliet as saying that Romeo’s name is “inhuman” or “ahuman.” “Not only does this name say nothing about you as a totality but it doesn’t say anything,” writes Derrida, “it doesn’t even name a part of you, neither your hand, nor your foot, neither your arm, nor your face, nothing that is human!” Juliet desires that arm, hand, and face, and aims to dissociate her Romeo from his name. There remains a strong connection—existential, essential, indexical, or whatever—between a person’s name and the person. Philosophers such as Plato, John Stuart Mill, and the early Ludwig Wittgenstein describe this connection as a solely denotative one. Others, such as Gottlob Frege, say that proper names both denote and connote, or in his parlance, have a “reference” and a “sense.” For him, when names denote they have both a sense and a reference, but when they do not denote, they may have “sense” (connotation) but no “reference” (denotation). My personal favorite philosophy of proper names comes though from the Princeton philosopher Saul Kripke, who said that proper names are “rigid designators,” meaning that they designate the same object in all possible worlds. Kripke even goes so far as to say that a name is attached to its bearer through a baptism of sorts, after which, it remains connected to its bearer regardless of any properties that may be attributed to that person. Hence, Nixon is Nixon even in possible worlds where he was not the president of the United States. Unlike Shakespeare’s heroine, who contends that the name of her beloved is something quite different than the young man with whom she is in love, most tend to believe that proper names denote and/or connote something. To dissociate a proper name from its object is to deny names their special nature. Names are strongly linked to identity, and are a crucial factor in developing a sense of self and interacting with the world. “By a name,” says Romeo to Juliet, “I know how to tell thee who I am.” The civil rights and women’s equality movements taught us to recognize the harmful and hateful legacies spawned by essentializing race and gender. These movements and others were synthesized into the precepts of political correctness that reminded us that regardless of race, class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality, we need to treat all people equally and not prejudge them based on bias or stereotypes associated with their names. One of the ways that political correctness regarding “names” was encoded into the humanities was the practice of “blind reviewing.” This means that when one submits an article, story, or poem to a journal, it is read by the reviewer without knowing in advance the name and identity of its author. The hope here is that the article, story, or poem is judged on its merit alone, not on the basis of the name and identity of the author. Or, in Juliet’s terms, not on the grounds of an inhuman proper name, but on the human work generated by the bearer of the proper name. Names often lead us to prejudge works; works without names, texts, if you will, help us to avoid evaluation bias. While some, including literary critic Stanley Fish, disagree with this position, arguing that there is “no merit without bias,” most progressive journals today follow the practice of blind-reviewing in order to avoid even the perception of bias or favoritism. Fish argued in favor of bias in peer review because he wanted to reap the benefits that his name brought to his submissions. He worked long and hard at building up his scholarly reputation and having his name on his submissions ensured that all who read them would know that...",

      "abstract": "IntroductionIn recent years, robots demonstrating an aping or imitating function have been proposed.Such functions can estimate the actions of a human being by using a non-contact method and reproduce the same actions.However, very few systems can imitate the behaviour of the hand or the fingers (Bernardin et al., 2005).On the other hand, reports in Neuroscience state that mirror neurons (Rizzolatti et al., 1996;Gallese et al., 1996), which participate in the actions imitated by chimpanzees, are activated only for actions of the hand and fingers, such as cracking peanut shells, placing a sheet of paper over an object, tearing the sheet into pieces, etc..Moreover, since human beings perform intelligent actions using their hands, it is important to attempt to artificially imitate the actions of hands and fingers in order to understand the dexterity and intelligence of human hands from an engineering viewpoint.The object actions in the case where one \"looks at an action performed by others and imitates it\" include not only grasping or manipulating objects but also the actions involving \"imitating shapes and postures of hands and fingers\" of others such as sign language and dancing motions.The latter two types of actions are often more complicated and require dexterity as compared to the former actions.In the action of imitating \"the shape of hands and fingers\" such as sign language, it is essential to estimate the shape of the hands and fingers.Furthermore, as compared to the imitation of the actions of the lower limbs, estimating the shape of the hands is significantly more important and difficult.In particular, human hands, which have a multi-joint structure, change their shapes in a complicated manner and often perform actions with self-occlusion in which the portion of one's own body renders other portions invisible.In the case of an artificial system, we can utilize a multi-camera system that records a human hand for imitative behaviours by surrounding it with a large number of cameras.However, all the animals that mimic the motions of others have only two eyes.To realize the reproduction of the actions of hands and fingers by imitating their behaviour, it is desirable to adopt a single-eye or double-eye system construction.To roughly classify conventional hand posture estimation systems, the following two types of approaches can be used.The first approach is a 3D-model-based approach (Rehg &",

      "abstract": "One major argument for why humans should try to establish settlements on other worlds is bet hedging: should an extinction level event befall Earth, having established a foothold on another world could prevent the untimely demise of the human species (not to mention other inhabitants of our shared ecosystem). There are a number of ways to critique this argument, but a particularly radical one seems to be gaining in popularity – a position I call eco-nihilism . Some scholars seem to want to argue that, even if settling other worlds is the only reliable way to ensure our survival, it is nevertheless unethical to do so - we must fold our collective hands over our chests and resign ourselves to our fate instead. In this chapter, I show that the eco-nihilist position rests on three assumptions that are each in need of further examination, namely: 1) There is no reasonable chance that humans can avoid destroying themselves through irresponsible action, 2) Every inhabitant of the Earth (human or otherwise) is, from a moral point of view, equally valuable, and 3) All humans are morally responsible for the bad actions of humanity and thus deserve to be punished in this way. I show that these assumptions are either simply false or, at best, extremely controversial. Thus I conclude that econihilism should be explicitly rejected by all interlocutors in the extraterrestrial settlement debates.",

Exactly through inactivity, the internal will of a person materializes due to which a person becomes a participant of public relations. At the same time in the absence of external expression of will inactivity of a person can not cause the occurrence of legal consequences, in particular, to be examined as a reason of origin of tort liabilities. If a person enacted because of negligence or poor awareness, it should be defined: whether a person knew or had to know about the necessity to perform a certain action. Accordingly, if a person possessed such knowledge this form of behavior will be treated as guilty omission, if not – this is an example of innocent omission. Responsibility for illegal omission can arise only when appropriate persons are included in the system of civil and legal relationships, thus are the subjects of civil relations. Damage caused by “reflexive movements” testifies the carelessness of a person to his/her behavior, which reflects his/her will. Therefore, such behavior of a person is considered to be wrongful.",

      "title": "Staging for Success: Preparing Environments for Productive Meetings, Trainings, and Workshops",
      "abstract": "Physical environment and people Physical settings can create cognitive and emotional reactions in people. In fact, many disciplines, including human ecology and environmental psychology, assert that environmental variables have an impact on human behavior. In ecological psychology, for instance, when the quality of the fit between human occupants and the physical environment is high, the people and the place are unified. Research on the restorative effects of the natural environment found that individuals report feeling rejuvenated and energized by the places that they occupy. Additionally, research on creativity suggests that people confined to a “featureless environment” do not perform to potential intellectually and emotionally. Environmental variables that may affect human behavior include the lack or the expansiveness of space; the location, shape, or temperature of a room; the texture and color of the walls and flooring; and the type and arrangement of furniture. Environmental variables may also include the absence or presence of natural lighting, windows with scenic views, and music or sounds that may be calming or distracting. Odors (e.g., the scent of flowers) may also conjure up images or set the mood in a given environment. Strong odors such as garbage, incense, strong perfume, or cologne may be distracting or off-putting. A person’s mood, attention span, and ability to focus may also be affected by color. For example, colors have the power to affect human senses by conveying meaning and presenting an atmosphere of pleasantness. Specifically, the cooler colors (blues, greens, and grays) create more passive participation, or a sense of coldness, while warm colors (such as reds and yellows) or light pastels tend to give a sense of warmth. From an environmental psychology perspective, extreme temperatures can reduce interpersonal attraction and interfere with successful task performance. For example, a study on hot and crowded areas found that participants in a room at normal temperature (72.4°F) reported feeling vigorous and comfortable, whereas individuals assigned to an overheated room (93.5°F) reported feelings of discomfort, fatigue, and sadness. High temperatures are also linked to loss of attention and productivity, and group members tend to be more aggressive when they are hot.",

      "title": "Willa Cather's \"Consequences\" and &lt;i&gt;Alexander's Bridge&lt;/i&gt;: An approach through R. D. Laing and Ernest Becker",
      "abstract": "Willa Cather's \"Consequences\" and Alexander's Bridge:An approach through R. D. Laing and Ernest Becker Fritz Oehlschlaeger (bio) In his classic work of existential psychiatry, The Divided Self, R. D. Laing explores and defines a \"schizoid way of being-in-the-world\" characterized by what he calls \"ontological insecurity,\" a condition in which \"the individual in the ordinary circumstances of living may feel more unreal than real; in a literal sense more dead than alive; precariously differentiated from the rest of the world, so that his identity and autonomy are always in question\" (42). The ontologically insecure person may respond to the anxiety that becomes his constant condition by a splitting or division in the self. He seeks to protect his inner or true self, which comes to be experienced as \"transcendent\" or \"disembodied,\" by developing a \"false self system\" (73) whose job it is to confront and manage reality. Moreover, there is in the ontologically insecure person \"a failure to sustain a sense of one's own being without the presence of other people. It is a failure to be by oneself, a failure to exist alone\" (52). Such dependence on others for one's identity, however, threatens the self with engulfment, with \"complete loss of being or absorption into the other\" [End Page 191] (44), and thus the ontologically insecure person frequently retreats into utter isolation. For him the poles of existence cease to be separateness and relatedness, for these are based upon a firm sense of one's own autonomy. Instead, he is torn \"between complete isolation or complete merging of identity . . . each equally unfeasible\" (53). Laing's description of ontological insecurity provides an extraordinarily useful set of concepts with which to approach two of Willa Cather's studies of anxiety and psychic division, the 1912 novel Alexander's Bridge and the 1915 short story \"Consequences,\" which shares many of the novel's motifs.1 \"Consequences\" is the story of a young man's being driven to suicide by his double, an alter-ego or projection of himself as an old man. Its hero, Keir Cavenaugh, is completely dependent on others for his identity. Indeed what one of Laing's patients said of himself could easily have been said by Cavenaugh: \"Other people supply me with my existence\" (52). Alexander's Bridge, of course, is the story of an engineer, Bartley Alexander, who undergoes a comprehensive splitting of his personality at midlife. After Bartley renews his relationship with Hilda Burgoyne, his becomes clearly a \"schizoid way of being-in-the-world.\" Why Bartley becomes thus divided can be illuminated dramatically by looking at his experience from a perspective supplied by Laing and by the related work of Ernest Becker. To define the nature and sources of Bartley's fragmentation and to allow \"Consequences\" and Alexander's Bridge to shed light on one another will be my purpose here. Keir Cavenaugh is the thirty-two-year-old son of \"a Pennsylvania preacher, who died soon after he discovered that his ancestral acres were full of petroleum\" (71). Cavenaugh has come to New York, where the story is set, to enjoy his fortune, which he does by lavishly entertaining others. But entertaining is not simply a pastime for Cavenaugh; it is the means by which he sustains his precarious sense of identity: His motor hit the Park every morning as if it were the first time ever. He took people out to supper every night. He went from restaurant to restaurant, sometimes to half-a-dozen in an evening. The head waiters were his hosts and their cordiality made him happy. They meide a life-line for him up Broadway and from Fifth Avenue. (71) Cavenaugh soon comes to be pursued, however, by an old man of decayed and shaby gentility. This figure seems to have an independent existence, but he is also clearly Cavenaugh's double, an alter-ego or projection of Cavenaugh himself as an old man. He appears only to Cavenaugh, and Cather is careful to leave ambiguous the problem of his corporeality. What [End Page 192] seems especially to disturb the old man is a photograph of Cavenaugh's twin brother Brian, who...",

Some promote reproductive success, like mates and food; others threaten reproductive success, like predators and injury. Beneficial PIEs induce activities that enhance them, and detrimental PIEs induce activities that mitigate or avoid them. Free‐operant avoidance relies on electric shock as a proxy for injury, a PIE. One theory takes avoidance behavior to be reinforced by its reducing shock rate. A more complete explanation is that avoidance both reduces shock rate and is induced by the PIEs it usually prevents. Shocks received act in concert with shock‐rate reduction, in a feedback system. Four parametric data sets were analyzed to show that avoidance is induced by received shock rate according to power functions. Avoidance is not reinforced at all; avoidance is induced by its failures. Induction explains not only avoidance itself, but also phenomena unique to avoidance, like warmup and effects of unavoidable shock. Induction explains behavior more generally than reinforcement, because induction explains not only food‐maintained operant and nonoperant behavior, but also shock‐maintained behavior, including avoidance. Reinforcement fails to explain behavior when reinforcement is defined as strengthening by consequences. Induction erases the distinction between consequences and antecedents.",

Thieves and trespassers are usually metaphoric, fictive creations (outside of course, people who actually do steal your wallet or enter your land without your permission and refuse to leave).They are also examples of moral panics. Moral panics in copyright are the flip side of the initial classification of copyright as property. The appellation thief or trespasser is meaningless without an owner of property from whom one can steal or commit trespass. In Daniel Defoe’s famous novel, did the cannibals care a hoot about Robinson Crusoe’s fenced-in habitation and cave? Hardly; to them, he was food, and if they had eaten him, they would not have taken over his created space; nor would it have prevented Crusoe from becoming an entrée if he had claimed a fee simple absolute over his living quarters and refused entry to the cannibals as trespassers. What good, then, is it to say you own property if there are no thieves or trespassers to do battle with? Copyright owners claiming status as property owners need to create conflict with others to create their status; the classical way in which such conflict is created is through moral panics.",

      "title": "The Problematics of Power",
      "abstract": "Abstract Cross-culturally, religion and religious leadership tend to be associated with or presented as manifestations of power over nature and power over people. Ceremonies that induce the soil to produce more crops or that induce the body to behave ac cording to God’s law rather than according to “natural instinct” are classic religious expressions of power over nature. Rituals of power over people include initiation ceremonies that sacralize the authority elders hold over initiates (cf. Bledsoe 1980), witchcraft accusations against individuals or groups who do not live exactly as religious authorities decree, and wedding ceremonies in which a man or his family’s ownership of a woman’s reproductive resources is legitimated. Religious control over people or nature by God, religion, or law often is made explicit: A prime example is the Buddhist aspiration to escape from the physical and emo tional bonds that tie the soul to this world and its inhabitants (bonds which perhaps not surprisingly-are believed to be stronger for women than for men; cf. Kirsch 1985 on Thailand). Power over people and power over nature tend to coincide in male-dominated religions. Sherry Ortner, in her now-classic 1974 essay “Is Female to Male as Na ture is to Culture?” argued that human culture is constituted through defining it self in opposition to nature-nature is, by cultural definition, what is not culture. According to Ortner, nature and culture not only stand in binary opposition to one another, they also stand in a conceptual relationship of hierarchy: Culture is seen as superior to nature because it is understood to be what conquers nature.ortner further suggested that in many if not all human societies, women—because of childbirth and child rearing—are perceived as more associated with nature and therefore inferior to men and culture. In her recent writings, Ortner has clarified this argument, underscoring the importance of religion in the patriarchal enterprise.",

      "title": "Primate aggression and evolution: an overview of sociobiological and anthropological perspectives.",
      "abstract": "Attempts to explain the nature and causes of human aggression are handicapped primarily because aggression is anything but a unitary concept. Aggression has no single etiology, no matter which mammalian species we consider or what kind of causation (developmental or evolutionary) we stress. Nevertheless, forensic psychiatrists are asked to evaluate instances of human aggression in ways that would send shivers up the spines of researchers who have been wrestling with the issue for over fifty years. This is not to say forensic psychiatry should be abolished nor to suggest behavioral scientists have not made progress in discovering causes of species aggression in genera}l and human violence in particular. But especially when predictive models are considered it does mean we are far from achieving highly reliable results.: Particularly when one person is asked to assess the motivational state of another who has committed a serious aggressive act it becomes more evident just how much more data we need. Strangely, if a forensic psychiatrist were asked to testify in a case in which, let us say, one monkey attacked another, the testimony would be based on more complete information than a case involving a human. This is because a plethora of context-specific data on nonhuman primates are available. These data illuminate a wide range of social, ecological, and endocrinological circumstances under which animals will be expected to act aggressively. Data on humans are much more complex, and sometimes they are absent altogether. For obvious ethical reasons scientists do not purposefully nor directly experiment on humans (biochemically, surgically, or hormonally) to determine how and when aggression can be induced. Moreover, among humans culture and biology are so tightly wedded that the task of identifying and isolating the. most salient aggression-eliciting factors is formidable, if, indeed, there is such a thing. If this is not discouraging enough, consider that the data available on human aggression, especially motivation, often lead in diverse directions without any indications about which direction may be most fruitful to explore.4 Perhaps I have painted an overly pessimistic picture. Just as forensic psychiatrists analyze and present conclusions about the mental states of accused aggressors, so also do researchers make use of a wide range of principles and assumptions in putting forth their hypotheses on primate",

      "abstract": "Quasi-Reasoning (Thomas Aquinas, Gregory of Rimini, John Duns Scotus)Thomas Aquinas addresses the question of whether or not nonhuman animals reason in connection with the famous example of Chrysippus' dog, which was originally formulated by the Stoic logician of the same name.1 Like most other Stoics, Chrysippus was relatively skeptical about, if not even hostile to, the idea of animal rationality.2His actual intention was not to make a case for the rationality of dogs.Rather, he simply aimed to illustrate a certain type of syllogism, namely, the so-called disjunctive syllogism.And so he told the story of a hunting dog that chases an animal but then loses sight of it and comes to a fork with three paths.Since the dog cannot see where the animal went it sniffs around the first and then around the second path, before finally taking the third way without sniffing.The dog in the example thus seems to employ a syllogism of the form 'The animal took either A or B or C, so if it did not take A or B it must have taken C' .As has been stated, Chrysippus simply took this to be a good illustration of a disjunctive syllogism.However -and quite ironically, one could say -his example became one of the most widespread examples of animal reasoning, especially through the Outlines of Pyrrhonism in which Sextus Empiricus turned this example against the Stoics' denial of animal intelligence and made it a proof of their rationality.3Thomas Aquinas, like many other medieval authors, likely knew this example through writings of the Church fathers, such as Basil of Caesarea's and Ambrose of Milan's Hexaemeron.4But what matters here is not so much how this example was handed on from one generation to the next but rather how 1 On the origin, history, and reception of this example, see Floridi (1997).A recent philosophical analysis and discussion provides Rescorla (2009). 2 On the Stoics' position see Dierauer (1977), 205-238; Sorabji (1993b), 20-28; Steiner (2005), 77-92.",

      "abstract": "\"Junk\" and the Other: Burroughs and Levinas on Drugs Jeffrey T. Nealon The metaphysical desire . . . desires beyond everything that can simply complete it. It is like goodness — the Desired does not fulfill it, but deepens it . . . . [Desire] nourishes itself, one might say, with its hunger. —Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity Junk yields a basic formula of “evil” virus: The Algebra of Need. The face of “evil” is always the face of total need. A dope fiend is a man in total need of dope. Beyond a certain frequency need knows absolutely no limit or control. . . . I never had enough junk. No one ever does. —William Burroughs, Naked Lunch “Just say no!” Odd advice indeed. Say no to what or to whom? Say no to a threat, to something that will draw you too far outside yourself. Say no because you want to say yes. Say no because, somewhere outside yourself, you know that this “you” owes a debt to the yes, the openness to alterity that is foreclosed in the proper construction of subjectivity. Of course, “just say no” never says no solely to a person — to a dealer or an addict; rather, you “just say no” to the yes itself — a yes that is not human but is perhaps the ground of human response. The constant reminder to “just say no,” then, is always haunted by a trace of the yes. As William Burroughs asks, “In the words of total need, ‘Wouldn’t you?’ Yes you would.”1 In Crack Wars: Literature, Addiction, Mania, Avital Ronell argues that the logics of drug addiction can hardly be separated from the discourse of alterity. As she writes, in the exterior or alterior space of addiction, “You find yourself incontrovertibly obligated: something occurs prior to owing, and more fundamental still than that of which any trace of empirical guilt can give an account. This relation — to whom? to what? — is no more and no less than your liability — what you owe before you think, understand, or give; that is, what you owe from the very fact that you exist.”2 Ronell is, of course, no simple apologist for a Romantic celebration of intoxication; as she writes, “it is as preposterous to be ‘for’ drugs as it is to take up a position ‘against’ drugs,”3 but it is the case that the logics of intoxication, as well as the kinds of desire that one can read in spaces of addiction, are inexorably tied up with current critical vocabularies of alterity and identity: postmodern thinkers increasingly understand alterity as a debt that can never be repaid, a difference that constitutes sameness, the incontovertiblity of a continuing obligation to someone or something “other.” Of course, the leisurely space of recreational drug use most often can and does serve to produce isolated reveries that cut the subject off from alterity, but the serial iteration of episodes of intoxication — what one might clinically or etymologically call “addiction,” being delivered over to an other — brings on another set of considerations.4 For example, as William Burroughs characterizes the junk equation in our epigraph from Naked Lunch it necessarily begins in an economy of simple need over which the subject exercises a kind of determinative imperialism: junkies want, on the surface, to be inside, to protect and extend the privilege of the same; they want the pure, interior subjectivity of the junk stupor — with “metabolism approaching absolute ZERO” (NL, p. xvii) — to keep at bay the outside, the other. But that economy of finite need and subjective imperialism quickly shows an economy of desire, an infinite economy of “total need” which breaks the interiority of mere need. In Naked Lunch Burroughs writes, in the voice of the smug, bourgeois “Opium ‘Smoker,’” How low the other junkies “whereas We — WE have this tent and this lamp and this tent and this lamp and this tent and nice and warm in here nice and warm nice and IN HERE and nice and OUTSIDE ITS COLD . . . . ITS COLD OUTSIDE where the dross eaters and the needle boys won’t last two years not six months hardly won’t stumble bum around and there is no class in them . . . . But WE SIT...",

      "title": "Language, gesture and meaning",
      "abstract": "We speak; we gesture. A variety of gestures occur naturally when people talk to each other. First, self-adaptors are self-touching movements which can be meaningful in interaction. For instance, a simple touch of the nose could mean that someone was not being truthful. Such movements do not bear a direct semantic relationship with the utterance. Emblematic gestures, on the other hand, are meaningful in their own right. They have socially agreed-upon standards of well-formedness and are produced in much the same way across the users of a particular language, like waving the hand for 'goodbye' or making the okay gesture for 'approval'. The emblematic meaning may or may not be associated with speech (Ekman and Friesen, 1969; Goldin-Meadow, 1999; Kendon, 1984, 1995, 2004; McNeill, 1992, 2005). Beat gestures, however, are bound to utterance. They are typically small up and down or back and forth flicks of one or both hands that occur along with the rhythm of speech (McNeill, 1992; McClave, 1994). Beat gestures have no semantic association with speech, but can be used to emphasize portions of the speech content (Efron, 1941, 1972; Wagner et al., 2014). McNeill (1992: 15) found that in narrative discourse, \"the occurrence of beats is related to discourse structure, when there are shifts among the narrative, metanarrative, and paranarrative levels of discourse\". Next, deictic gestures have to do with pointing to linguistic referents in the immediate speech environment. Spatial gestures are used to allocate gesture spaces symbolically to the linguistic referents. Finally, iconic gestures bear a direct semantic relationship with speech (McNeill, 1992, 2000). The meaning conveyed by iconic gestures mainly rests upon context. Consider Figure 16.1. The speaker on the left, who first had the arms crossed under the chest, moved the hands to the front; then, the hands in lightly formed fists, the left one slightly above the right, moved in a curve from the center to her right periphery. It is difficult to comprehend what such gesture means in the interaction without the presence of speech, despite the fact that the hand movements are conspicuous, noticeable, and produced in the center space (see the Gesture Space in McNeill, 1992).",

Bergson' Rigidity, which is out of harmony with the immanent plasticity of life, provokes laughter', 'the mechanical that goes behind life provokes laughter'. He never speaks of the reason for laughter, but only about its purpose. There are two things to be considered: laughing in itself; laughing at. An individual who does not join in the laughter does not permit the feeling of pleasure to arise and therefore does not need the defence. Laughter is a general physiological defence against discomfort-causing pleasure. A completely bad man prevents the release of pleasure and remains serious. If a consciously moral person releases unconscious pleasure, his ego defends itself by means of laughter against the advancing pleasure.",

      "title": "Buddhism, Intuition, and Virtue",
      "abstract": "Buddhism, Intuition, and Virtue Robert Feleppa 1. Introduction Buddha's Four Noble Truths seem to embody a practical morality that values beneficial consequences and the minimization of suffering. However, there is a tension between the aim of this practical morality and Buddhism's highest good of nirvāna: although the Noble Truths aim at the reduction of suffering, they also seem to identify the pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of suffering as among the roots of delusion and attachment to self. Moreover, this practical morality seems to depend in large part on conceptual understanding of the causes of suffering and delusion, as expressed, for example, in Buddha's articulations of the Noble Truths and the Perfections. Yet conceptual modes of thought are also linked in deep ways to attachment to self. Gowans (2015) summarizes the key points as follows: A person on the path to enlightenment, but far short of enlightenment, may well succumb to something akin to akrasia: recognizing that something is wrong, but still doing it on account of lust, anger or other hindrances. Moreover, on common Buddhist models of the path to enlightenment, there is no suggestion that philosophical understanding of a sound argument for no-self or emptiness, or for universal compassion, would by itself make a person compassionate. The intellectualism sometimes associated with the Socratic claim, that a purely rational understanding of what is good would [End Page 121] be sufficient for actually being good, has no counterpart in these Buddhist perspectives. (186) These troubles about the relationship of reason and attachment obscure Buddhism's philosophical as well as its ethical import. Indeed, one might argue that Buddha's concern is with liberation and not morality at all—an amoralism often attributed to figures in the Chan and Zen Buddhist traditions—and typically seen as reflecting Daoist influences on the development of Chinese Buddhism. Daoism's emphatic assaults on conceptual/symbolic reasoning raise some serious questions about how a practice aimed at liberating us from self and reason can assist in the living of a reasoned moral life. However, I think that we can address these concerns by drawing on recent research on the psychology and neuroscience of the emotions and particularly what this research tells us about the relationships between emotion and reason.1 First I will develop two preliminary points: (1) that initial tensions between Buddhism's apparent consequentialism and its central focus on nirvana can be addressed; and (2) its apparent antipathy to conceptualized principles of morality can be partly addressed by considering its primary concern with the cultivation of virtue and not the articulation of codes of conduct. However, this only sets the stage for inquiry into the deeper connections between ethical transformation and selflessness, especially as articulated in the thoughts of the influential Third Patriarch of Chan Buddhism, Jiangzhi Sengcan (496?–606 CE), and particularly as expressed in certain passages of a work attributed to him, the Xinxinming (The Verses of the Heart-Mind). Although these can be interpreted as defending an amoralistic, possibly iconoclastic reading of Buddhism, I will support a reading with a quite different thrust. I argue that Sengcan offers a subtle understanding of the place of traditional religious practices such as meditation (zazen), sūtra study, and adherence to codes of proper conduct, essential for the cultivation of insight and moral character, while at the same time being mindful of two dangers: (1) that traditional practices alone may well reinforce afflictive tendencies if they serve only as means of escape from uncertainty and suffering—a defining feature of Chan—and (2) a related failure to appreciate the subtler and spiritually powerful attachments to beliefs, manifest in the ways we hold or favor or identify with beliefs. The two tendencies are interrelated: by suppressing thought and feeling, one prevents the inward reflection needed to reveal deeply seated emotional leanings. Jeff Shore (2016) remarks: If zazen is thoroughgoing, one's mind is not caught or hindered by anything. But if zazen is not yet settled, one may enter the concentrated [End Page 122] oneness of Samadhi—then get stuck there and dwell in it, using it as an escape. It becomes itself a hindrance.

First, labor is response about God's calling. Second, labor is God's representation about the world. Human must rule the world according to the God's will as His steward which is delegated the creation world by Himself. Third, there is purpose of labor to the glory of God.

      "title": "[On compulsive hand-washing--psychopathology of \"touching\"].",
      "abstract": "Compulsive hand-washing has been well known to the psychiatrists, since Legrand du Saulle described this disorder by the name of \"délire du toucher\" (1866), which refers to mysophobia or contact-phobia. But its clinical significance seems to have been not fully examined, except from the psychoanalytical point of view, that has observed the repression of sexuality in its pathology. This report presents four cases of compulsive hand-washing, and explores why they exclusively wash their hands. In order to elucidate the reason for their hand-washing and its significance, this report aims to study the relation of following three elements; \"Sexuality\", \"hand\" and \"touching\". As the idioms using \"hand\" often represent the various modes of sexual life in Japanese language as well as in English, so the \"touching by hand\" is reasonably considered to evoke the sexual impulsions, which the hand-washers fear and wish to avoid. On the other hand, \"touching\" is, necessarily in nature, to be touched by the touched object. For example, one who touches the lover's hand is inevitably to be touched by hers. That is; one is forced to be an object of one's object, which becomes to be a subject. In this sense, the act of \"touching\" means to lose one's \"being subject\" and to melt oneself into the situation where the structural distinction of subject and object can disappear. So one's act of \"touching\" or vivid contact with the other can cause anxiety by means of losing one's ego, which may be also a critical point to introduce to create something new. A compulsive hand-washer fears and avoids this critical moment that can make him lose his \"being subject\", so he \"washes his hands of (cuts off relation with)\" the situation that can undermine his ego. This avoidance of having contact can be compared to \"the lose of vivid contact with the reality (la perte du contact avec la réalité (Minkowski)\" observed in schizophrenia. In their ways of life, many hand-washers are not less autistic than the schizophrenics.om",

      "title": "The Robust Demands of the Good",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book argues that we human beings can enjoy a good life only insofar as we act towards one another out of attachments like love and friendship, virtues like honesty and fidelity, and the respect that enables us each to enjoy autonomy in exercising our basic liberties. The goods we put in one another’s hands by acting out of such dispositions make robust demands. I do not enjoy an attachment like your friendship just because you actually give me favour; you must provide that treatment regardless of my charm or your convenience. And as this is true for friendship and favour, so it is true for a virtue like honesty and truth-telling, and for any form of respect and non-interference. In each case my enjoyment of the good requires you to treat me well, not just actually, but robustly: that is, across ways things might be as well as ways things actually are. The book argues that making a place in ethics for the goods of attachment, virtue, and respect has serious implications for how we think people ought to behave. It means that doing good is not just a matter of performing beneficial acts; it requires performing those acts out of beneficent dispositions. And it requires those who seek to do what is right to let themselves be guided under suitable conditions by motives of attachment, virtue, and respect: they must give those dispositions a controlling role in their lives.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to examine practical knowledge for monks (bhikkhu) to abstain from injuring and killing living beings in daily life, with reference to the Vinayapiṭaka of Theravāda and its commentary, the Samantapāsādikā.<BR> Manifestly, we cannot completely avoid causing harm throughout our entire lives, and this is also true of monks, who may harm humans and injure or kill other living beings such as animals and insects in everyday life. However, it is not every kind of killing and injuring that the Vinayapiṭaka requires monks to avoid; some do not constitute an offense.<BR> The Vinayapiṭaka has its own criteria for determining what is an offense. As is well known, the criteria involve a karmic way of thinking. Intentional injuring and killing is an offense because it creates bad karma, while actions that are unintentional are not offenses because they do not create bad karma and thus hinder the spiritual achievement.<BR> Most of us would know that this karmic way of thinking plays an important role in the judgment of criminal deeds, but few of us would precisely know the kind of injuring and killing that constitutes an offense. In actual monastic life, however, this is an important issue. No matter how well monks know the gravity of the karmic way of thinking on a theoretical basis, it does not follow from this that they can successfully discern criminal deeds. In fact, they need practical knowledge in order to avoid intentional injuring and killing.<BR> Thus, I would like to examine monastic rules related to killing and injuring as stipulated in the Vinayapiṭaka with close reference to the Samantapāsādikā and reveal practical knowledge for monks to avoid harming humans and injuring and killing other living beings in their daily lives. Specifically, I will look at Paṭhavīkhaṇanasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 10), Bhūtagāmasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 11), Sappāṇakasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 20), Sañciccasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 61), Sappāṇakasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 62), and Pahārasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 74) to show when and how these rules apply to monks and how monks can avoid breaking these rules.",

      "abstract": "Once while describing an aspect of man’s fundamental nature, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said that the son of Adam becomes old with senility, but yet two things remain with him intact: greed and hope (Sahih al-Bukhari). \r\nThe Prophet (pbuh) also taught that when the latter two become unrestrained, taking over a person’s total being, he with his actions and decision making, in turn, becomes uncontrollable. He stops at nothing in order to try to satisfy his raging impulses. No action, or word, that comes from such a person should be seen as a surprise. \r\nThe Prophet (pbuh) thus said that if the son of Adam possessed two valleys of gold, he would long for a third one; “and nothing would fill (satiate) the stomach – or the mouth -- of the son of Adam but dust (that is, after he dies)” (Sahih Muslim).\r\nMan can easily become a world of paradoxes. Under the pressure of his recurring misjudgments, his inborn disposition and a myriad of external factors and forces, man can easily give in to the advances of his perennial anxieties, unfounded optimism and profligacy, relegating the transcendent power of his reason (intellect or ‘aql), as well as his primordial nature (instinct or fitrah), to the backseat. One moment he can think and act like an angel; the next he can be like a devil. \r\nThe similar thing Satan (Iblis) had in mind when he plotted to deceive Adam and his wife Eve (Hawa) and drive them out from the Garden of Eden. He whispered to them, coaxing them: “Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?” (Ta Ha, 120).",

      "abstract": "When Glaucon and Adeimantus demand that Socrates demonstrate that the just person is happier than the unjust, they are demanding that he show that justice is a good for the soul. Relying on ordinary, common, beliefs, they argue that the consequences of acting unjustly without a reputation for injustice are clearly advantageous. The just person without a just reputation ends up entirely bereft of material possessions, tortured, and finally killed – that is, deprived of absolutely all “external goods.” By contrast, the unjust person who maintains a reputation for justice receives all of the good consequences of that reputation, namely, safety and security for himself and his material possessions, as well as the abundance of material possessions acquired through his unjust behavior, which can then be used to guarantee that one does not suffer any bad consequences in the afterlife by bribing the gods. On “the many's” account justice's and injustice's only value for the soul consists in desire satisfaction or frustration. On this score justice in itself is “painful” (ἐπίπονον) and “harsh” (χαλεπόν), since it thwarts a person's allegedly natural desire for pleonexia. Such a sacrifice of immediate desire may be worth it in circumstances where a person is too weak to ensure that he will not suffer injustice in turn. But since the good consequences of justice can be obtained equally well by successfully seeming to be just, such desire frustration, given propitious circumstances, might not be necessary.",

      "title": "Lameness – Los Contrechos",
      "abstract": "Old Spanish uses an all-encompassing word for the type of disabilities that will be discussed in this chapter – contrecho. Contrecho can denote one who is deformed, crippled, maimed, lame, hunchbacked, paralyzed, or even the modern equivalent of estropeado/a, meaning ruined. Anyone labelled contrecho/a would have some sort of bodily ‘defect’ in that he/she might be missing a limb, have withered or twisted limbs, suffer a deformity from birth, or otherwise experience some sort of mobility issue or disfiguring condition. All these types of impairments are what Irina Metzler labels ‘visible’, that is, ones that are more noticeable than other impairments as, for example, deafness, mental impairment, or even diabetes or asthma. She claims that ‘[g]reater visibility of an impairment would […] bring with it greater cultural or social consequences for the affected individual’. Metzler also points out the variety and inconsistency of terms applied to such physical impairments in the Middle Ages. This irregularity of terminology is true for Spanish texts for although the overriding term contrecho/a is frequently used, there are a host of other words to denote specific physical limitations such as cojo/a (lame), manco/a (missing a limb, especially an arm or hand), paralítico/a (paralytic), giboso/a (hunchbacked), or variations on its modern equivalent, corcovado/a (hunchbacked or humpbacked) as well as other designations and variant spellings of the ones mentioned here. I will include in this chapter an examination of literary texts where individuals are described with vocabulary that infers that they are lame, missing one or more limbs, hunchbacked, partially or completely paralyzed, or otherwise physically deformed. In all cases these impairments are clearly noticeable to others and the individuals usually require some form of mobility assistance. Physical difference that is readily visible to all demands an explanation and the literature in which contrechos appear ‘inaugurates an explanatory opportunity that the unmarked body eludes by virtue of its physical anonymity’. Mitchell and Snyder speak of the visceral nature of response to physical deformity and claim that representations of physical imperfection in literature evoke ‘powerful sentiments within the safe space of textual interactions’.",

Â—John Locke, Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690-1706)' Mr. Locke's Opponents needed but to examine, calmly and impartially, whether the declaring that Matter can think, implies a Contradiction; and whether God is able to communicate Thought to Matter. Â—Voltaire, Letters concerning the English Nation (1733)2 One of Citibank's recent television campaigns peddles the company's fraud-protection services by depicting identity-theft victims speaking in the voices of their impersonators. The advertisements construe the crime as a form of body-snatching, or at least as an uncanny assumption of another's buying power, and thus remind viewers that the virtual marketplace of credit cards and Internet shopping offers consumers opportunities to consume even as it simultaneously renders buyers vulnerable to possession; one's identity, the ads threaten, may circulate as freely as the goods one purchases. The humor of the commercials is conveyed through unlikely juxtapositions of class, age, gender, and ethnicity that tend to minimize the risk that identity theft poses to the victim's core selfhood. No one who knows these people, the ads suggest, could possibly confuse them with the disembodied, usurping voices speaking through them. Yet viewers are left with a disquieting sense that their identities 77 78 / BLACKWELL are somehow vulnerable, prey to \"unbodied spirits\" that lurk online or in unmarked vans parked near ATMs. Identity is but another type of commodity, a thing of which one may be dispossessed. Though identity theft of this sort is a peculiarly modem phenomenon, it nonetheless resonates with the distinctive conceit of numerous canonical eighteenth-century English fictions, including Moll Flanders (1722) and Tom Jones (1749), texts predicated on their title characters' tendency to lose themselves and assume the identities of others. Scholars eager to tell a particular story about attitudes toward human identity in the eighteenth century often invoke John Locke's Essay concerning Human Understanding ( 16901706 ) as one of the forces shaping the novelistic presentation of self in the period. Emst Cassirer long ago touted Locke as the \"guide and master\" of eighteenth-century psychology, and more recent historians and critics have cited the Essay in order to explain the increasing importance of the freestanding individual and the psychological self in Enlightenment writing.3 Thus, Ian Watt conjures Locke's authority in order to provide a philosophical basis for the novel's \"truth to individual experience\" and its \"particularizing approach to character,\" while Hans Aarsleff credits Locke with inspiring the novel's \"new intimacy and even inwardness in the conception and portrayal of character.\"4 Indeed, Locke's influence is especially crucial to the magisterial \"rise-of-the-novel\" thesis sketched by Watt, though the outlines ofthat thesis can perhaps be traced as early as Voltaire's Letters concerning the English Nation (1733). Voltaire distinguishes the romance-writing philosophers of previous generations from Locke, who offers what Watt might describe as \"a full and authentic report of human experience\": \"Such a Multitude of Reasoners having written the Romance of the Soul, a Sage at last arose, who gave... the History of it. Mr. Locke has display'd the human Soul, in the same Manner as an excellent Anatomist explains the Springs of the human Body.... He takes an Infant at the instant of his Birth; he traces, Step by Step, the Progress of his Understanding.\"5 Voltaire constmes the Essay as a sort of bildungsroman of human understanding. However, Watt's compelling, still-influential story of prose fiction's growing emphasis on the \"anatomy\" of the individual character depends on a rather narrow reading of Locke's Essay, especially of its groundbreaking account of personal identity. Voltaire himself alludes to Locke's theory of identity-in-consciousness when he suggests that Locke's attention to the particularity of his own experience renders his \"history\" persuasive: \"Above all...",

The third and fourth theories may be called “indeterministic freedom” and “the agency theory,” named only to be rejected. I reject indeterminism out of agreement with a long tradition which holds that (a) there is no reason to think that human actions are ever undetermined, and (b) an undetermined human action would not be “free” in any sense in which we desire our actions to be free and believe that they are in fact free. To appreciate (b), reflect that agents should control and be accountable for “free” actions. Now, we control an event by assembling or obstructing its sufficient conditions; merefore, an event without sufficient conditions, a random event which just happens, would lie beyond human control and, hence, the sphere of human freedom. Similarly, a man is no more responsible for what happens independently of his choices – and an event without sufficient conditions cannot have a choice as a sufficient condition – than he is responsible for the behavior of a roulette wheel.",

      "abstract": "Hume Studies Volume 30, Number 1, April 2004, pp. 51-85 Scratched Fingers, Ruined Lives, and Acknowledged Lesser Goods CASS WELLER It is not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. It is not contrary to reason for me to choose my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian, or person wholly unknown to me. It is as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledged lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent affection for the former than the latter. (T 2.3.3.6; SBN 416)1 Everyone is familiar with the cases Hume parades in this passage when he dramatically displays just how far one's preferences and other passions can go without being contrary to reason. His general point is tediously clear. Whatever failing there is in one who prefers the destruction of the world to the scratching of his finger or chooses his total ruin to prevent the least uneasiness of a person wholly unknown to him, it is not a failing of reason, unless this preference and choice involve false suppositions of fact, existence, or mathematics. But they do not according to Hume. So they are not contrary to reason. At the same time, anyone who is given to worrying and fretting over the text will be initially somewhat at a loss to explain in any further detail the nature of the phenomena Hume flaunts as not flouting reason and how they relate to one another. For example, is the notion of preference at work that of a settled judgment of value or that of a blind impulse to be understood only in terms of strength of desire? Is the character Hume inhabits in the first person one who simply finds himself with a blind urge to keep his finger scratch-free or one who Cass Weiler is Associate Professor of Philosophy, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. e-mail: cjwr@u.washington.edu 52 Cass Weller has a settled policy of keeping his finger scratch-free viewed as more valuable than anything else. Is preferring my lesser good to my acknowledged greater good the practical counterpart of self-consciously believing that Ï• and not p? Or is it, rather, a common form of weakness? And if so, how is it related to the two previous cases? Although most discussions of Hume's views on practical reason refer to this passage, I know of no extended discussion of the three notorious cases.2 This is no doubt due in part to the fact that the details do not really matter for understanding the main point. A mental state not involving a false belief of experience or a priori reason cannot be contrary to reason.3 Nevertheless, I think it is a good idea to try and figure out just what Hume is saying and that by digging right here we may hope to uncover important aspects of Hume's theory of evaluation, motive, and reason. The task is to get a more detailed view of Hume's own theoretical understanding of the preferences and choices he exhibits as not contrary to reason, in particular whether a preference is an evaluative attitude, and how it may conflict with an acknowledged interest. To this end we will have to go beyond what is adequate for a reader's understanding of the preferences in their narrow rhetorical context. Hume himself invites the reader, inadvertently or not, to look for the wider Humean explanation of preferring one's acknowledged lesser good to the greater by deploying the analogy of a one pound weight's raising a hundred through the advantage of its situation. This idea connects with other passages in the Treatise, as we shall see, in particular with Hume's discussion of the preference for the contiguous over the remote at T 3.2.7 (SBN 534-9). With a clearer view of Hume's understanding of the preferences we will be in a better position to ask about the sort of criticism persons with such preferences are subject to. And, to tip my hand, we will see that Hume...",

      "abstract": "While the stories of the so-called Primeval History (Gen. 1-11) often appear repetitious, in fact they invariably advance the theme(s) significantly. Thus, while the Flood narrative might suggest a reiteration of the theme of human disobedience, it actually offers significant variations. The introductory and concluding episodes (6.1-4 and 9.20-27), which may function like a chiasmus, suggest that illicit relationships lead inevitably to that violence which destroys creation. Specifically, the activities of the 'sons of God' mirror those of Ham with the drunken Noah, or his wife. Even perfect human obedience (Noah), which it was carlier implied might have ensured humanity's tenure in Eden, provides insufficient protection against such disorder. Hence the necessity of first covenant and then Law/Torah as structures to ensure not only the survival of creation, but to channel human violence elsewhere, and to allow humanity full access to God.",

A comment may be produced by the present interlocutor or the third listener by means of body signals. Various facial, gestural, and bodily comments are overviewed in political debates, highlighting their use mainly as a subtle, unwarranted but clear way to discredit people during debates: their senders take advantage of their being framed on the screen, to convey their opinions while somehow violating turn-taking norms.",

A common observation in and about Alltown is that in the past 'cousins married cousins', and that 'original Alltown families' were all related to each other. Similar ideas of interrelatedness are deployed in descriptions of present-day Alltown and are used to portray either its 'parochial' or its 'friendly' nature.

      "title": "Teleological Notions",
      "abstract": "Abstract The key term of Aristotle’s teleology is “the cause for the sake of which”. Aristotle discusses in several key texts (Physics, On the Soul, Metaphysics, Eudemian Ethics) the fact that this has two different senses: aim and beneficiary. The aim of a knife is cutting, but the beneficiary is the person who does, or orders, the cutting. Aristotle uses this distinction to show how natural things have both aims and are beneficiaries of their functions. He also shows how non-natural things, such as god, can operate as causes for the sake of which, but not as beneficiaries. Eternal things (like the unmoved mover, forms of living things, the universe itself, nature, and so forth) cannot be beneficiaries, because they cannot undergo change. Thus, the beneficiaries of Aristotle’s teleology are the elements, plants, and animals that can both undergo change and have functional aims. A survey of other terms of Aristotle’s teleology, such as “nature does nothing in vain”, the terms “complete” or “perfect”, as well as “end” and “entelechy” further show the specific orientation of Aristotle’s teleology, as do his use of axiological terms such as “better” and “fine”.",

Activities that have only this goal – for example, kissing embracing, and caressing under certain conditions – ‘qualify as sexual, even without the presence of genital symptoms of sexual excitement’.

      "title": "Learned helplessness",
      "abstract": "Helplessness is a state in which nothing a person opts to do affects what is happening. It is the quitting or the give up response that follows the conviction that whatever a person does doesn't matter.[1] Learned helplessness (LH) was initially used to label the failure of certain laboratory animals to escape or avoid shock, despite giving an opportunity, subsequent to earlier exposure to unavoidable shock.[23] Now, the term has been applied to the failure of human beings to pursue, utilize, or acquire adaptive instrumental responses. It is observed in a depressed person who seems to have given up hope that effective voluntary control over important environmental events is possible.[4] People suffering from LH accept that bad things will take place and they will have little control over them.[5] Those who are exposed to complex problems for an extended period learn that responses and events are unconnected. Learning attained in this situation weakens imminent learning and leads to inactivity. Consequently, they will be unsuccessful to resolve any concern even if there is a possible solution for the concern.[6] The LH hypothesis has been reformulated as the old hypothesis does not distinguish between the outcomes that are uncontrollable for all the people and those uncontrollable only for some (universal vs. personal helplessness). It does not explain when helplessness is general or specific; chronic or acute. Reformulation states that the helplessness is attributed to a cause by people. The cause can be stable or unstable, global or specific, and internal or external.[7] Helplessness may be considered as a consequence of early socialization experiences. More specifically, the rigidity and negativism emphasized in our family systems are likely to affect the child's development of competence. A number of sociocultural features may also play their part. Hence, it is essential to explore the role of socialization as it relates to the development of child's helplessness.[6] Children who had history of abuse and neglect during their childhood and adolescence can develop a state of LH. Consequences of emotional abuse may be repeated abnormal or disrupted attachment development and the sufferer blames him/herself for the abuse, leading to LH, emotional distress, and excessively inactive behavior. Psychological abuse is often combined with other forms of abuse.[8] Children who have experienced chronic neglect are likely to have attribution models which conceptualize themselves as powerless and of low value. Neglected children are less likely to know that they are being neglected or to know that something can be done about it.[910] The capacity to cope, and thrive, subsequent to an adverse experience is often stated as resilience. A number of protective and supportive factors may contribute to an abused or neglected child's resilience. These include positive attachment, self-esteem, intelligence, emotion regulation, humor, and independence.[11] LH may be observed in the elderly, due to repeated exposure to events perceived beyond their control eventually display cognitive, motivational, and affective deficits of helplessness. The loss of self-esteem may also occur if the individual believes that he/she is personally accountable for the situations.[12] Other effects of elder abuse may include feelings such as separation, guilt, shame, fear, anxiety, and rejection.[13] The LH model gives the impression that instrumental coping behavior is the most adaptive response to threat on every occasion. Nonetheless, adaptive escape/avoidance responses are not always available for some kinds of aversive events. This is of some clinical and behavioral guidance interest to the dentists.[1415] Learned Helplessness and Dental Practice The theory of LH provides an understanding of certain noncompliant behavior observed in some of the dental patients. Patients experience a loss of self-esteem due to the feeling of helplessness and victimization, or suspicion and doubt of what the oral health-care provider says or does that can lead to communication failure.[16] History of childhood and adult trauma related to various types of abuse and neglect appears to be significantly associated with high dental fear although multiple factors play a key role. Various degrees of helplessness, powerlessness, and incidents of lack of control during dental treatments were reported. Fears of being trapped in the dental chair, claustrophobia, being unable to breathe, and feeling of chocking or severe gagging that interferes with dental treatments were reported.[17] The noise created by dental operatory can induce LH, increase arousal, alter the choice of task approach, and decrease the attention of the dental patients.[18] Dental practitioners and their auxiliaries can play distinct role in facilitating to prevent or reverse the effects of helplessness in their patients. The practitioners can enhance the perceived control of their patients, by providing them with choices that are probable and practical, which will enhance their success experience. They also need to promote autonomy and self-sufficiency in their patients, and to discard the penchant to do everything for the patients, those age/skill appropriate tasks that can be individually accomplished. Dental staff members can use these guidelines to improve the quality of their communication with their patients and can be influential in preventing or reducing the behavioral discrepancies associated with LH.[12] We have a crucial role in identifying this state of LH in our dental patients, including children, adolescents, adults, elderly, or those with special health-care needs and guide them consequently in a dental situation. Otherwise, they may continue to suffer the pain and discomfort if any, without complaining, that may lead to long term consequences.",

      "abstract": "We tested pet dogs (Canis familiaris; n=75) for their ability to mentally represent a person who is no longer perceivable. A subject watched and then searched for a person after they hid themselves behind one of two occluders. In the critical test, before being released to search, the subject saw the occluder where the person disappeared move next to an empty occluder. A second experiment then showed the subject the hidden person was no longer behind the original occluder. To successfully find the person, subjects needed to infer that the hidden person had moved behind the second occluder – even though the subject did not directly perceive the switch in locations. Dogs were able to find their owner, when they were the person that was hidden, but only some dogs were able to find an unfamiliar person. Controls ruled out the possibility that dogs simply smelled or heard the hidden person move or that they associated some observable movement with reward. Results support the hypothesis that dogs have secondary representations or “people permanence”, when their owner is invisibly displaced. The performance also suggests the possibility that dogs maintain richer representations of groupmates with whom they are bonded. Future research can test if, after an invisible displacement, dogs primarily represent their owners or if in other contexts they can also represent other social agents and objects.",

The main benefit of the sense connection is still lost if an object of certain nature does not still have a property's association to even a single another object (-s). We propose a new paradigm of a mathematical space that is sense-centered and AI-focused in its nature. One of the main purposes of this space are to create an informational sphere for a a massive number of heterogeneous objects by the existed sense relationship between them. It may be extremely useful if a life event (behavior) in the future of one person, say buying a car could be described by another life event (behavior) in the past of another person, say the baby's a birthday celebration or the properties of physical phenomena in the past will trigger some actions in the future.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of libertarian post revolutionary area, the individual has emerged from the mass, claiming to be the master of his own destiny, especially by getting back the possession of his body. The fact that suicide is no longer punished seems to confirm this new situation. Actually, if this act is not a punishable offence, we should not conclude that it is the recognition of a right but rather the acknowledgement of the inadequacy of a penalty which eventually affected the family of the suicide. Taboo of a taboo (death), suicide, because it asks our conscience questions which are never really answered, can only provoke contradictory and extreme reactions. This intimate pact between a person and death whereby he kills himself at the time he chooses, excludes the whole community. Society, getting its own back, only allows him to pull himself out furtively, because this fragile consensus doesn't tolerate any exception. That is why, as soon as a third person interferes in this process of self-destruction, the law is jack with its old severity; in a case of aiding and abelting suicide the law will try to remedy this questionable impunity by means of legal subterfuge; in a case when the victim asked someone to kill him, the third party, the main actor, will be prosecuted for wilful killing, murder or poisoning. However the third party may also become an ally in the fight against suicide when the law, unable to act directly on or to reason with the suicide himself or to forbid the action itself",

In Bleak House, as elsewhere in Dickens, to be symbolically intimate with or proximate to animals – and especially to \"follow\" or \"go after\" them – is to fall into a state of questionable or precarious humanness or wholeness. These thematics recur throughout Dickens' later work, as he frequently returns to a set of figures, images, and ideas relating to anxieties of dehumanization and fears of animalization. Great Expectations in particular exhibits a fear of being forgotten or misremembered, of \"perishing out of all human knowledge,\" a fate which Dickens specifically links to the state of being an animal, or of being animalized. This chapter suggests that Dickens' very practices of characterization, and his definition of human characters and protagonists, should be understood in relation to his conception of the animal.",

      "title": "Elements of Luo Traditional Sacrifice: An Anthropological Approach",
      "abstract": "Every religion has some form of sacrifice. In fact, sacrifice is the most widespread of all rituals. It derived from two Latin words: “sacer”, which means holy, sacred or set apart and “facere,” which means to do or to make. So, to sacrifice is to make holy or to set something apart for supernatural powers. Most rituals imply an offering and quite often a blood sacrifice. A blood sacrifice is a displacement of mystical forces made possible by God himself, thanks to the intercession of a spirit, divinity or ancestor and the mediation of a priest for the satisfaction of the sacrificing community. The blood of the victim, when poured on the altar, releases the vital force contained in it and feeds the spiritual beings directly alerted by the words of the priest. We have here an offering of food given to the sacred forces, which gives life to the sacrificing community through a common meal. We also have the words of the priest to the divinity or ancestor who intercedes to God. The response of God comes in an inverted way: it goes to the sacrificing community through the ancestor and the priest. Note here that God does not feed on the blood of the victim; God is the very source of the vital force; for him the vital force does not diminish. It is the whole community, which performs what we can call the rite of diverted violence. When the animal is killed, sometimes very cruelly, the violence, which would be directed to people is done on the animal, which is their substitute. It is at the same time an elevated violence since it is transported from the profane to the sacred. It is also a transcended violence since it enables the community to transfer the grudges, rivalries, hatred, tension and the tendencies of aggression within it to an animal victim. This is the way the community “deceives” its own violence by directing it to victims which do not call for vengeance. All in all, sacrifice in whatever form is for respect of life, that is, in sacrifice, life is not lost; it just becomes sublime. Sacrifice occupies a fundamental place in the practice of African traditional religion. It is through sacrifices that the African relates to the spiritual. The religious nature of African ritual, as historians of religions have stressed, is such that: “A ritual is religious, if it carries an ultimate value, meaning, sacrality and significance for someone, that is, if it somehow functions for someone as the foundation of what is considered real and sacred” (Richard 1978: 65).",

      "title": "El desequilibrio emocional y comportamientos depresivos estudiado desde el desequilibrio de los chakras",
      "abstract": "It is logical to think that like trees, human beings need strong and stable roots to avoid falling or collapsing. These roots are what allow us to stand and endure the adversities that come out in life. It is in them, where the human being finds its base and its stability. When people do not find that stability in themselves, they usually look for them in someone or something else. According to the approach that I intend to develop, this is a brief explanation of why there are dependent relationships between human beings. If the person does not find stability in himself, he or she will automatically look for it in another. But what happens if people lose this stability altogether? If the person does not find it in himself, or in any other thing or person that surrounds them?\r\n\r\nFrom this point my research starts. My concern arises from the fact of wanting to know what lies in the lack of stability that often ends in dependence on other people or that may even end in suicide. My research basically focuses on the need to answer a question that came up after my personal experience. What makes a person get to the point of wanting to take his own life?\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, many times, the explanations that are given to this type of behavior, are usually linked to depressive behaviors that are usually explained and treated by processes and psychiatric knowledge. But, what happens when traditional medicine does not always have an explanation for all the behaviors of the human being? The reality is that there are many cases of depressive symptoms that can be treated without any traditional medical process that involves the use of antidepressants or any other medication.\r\n\r\nMy proyect is not directed to demerit traditional medicine, nor much less. What I intend is to try to give many people, who may be going through similar situations, another alternative; An alternate path a little away from what is normally taught and is instilled in people since childhood. But also, a way that manages to give explanations and solutions to many things that sometimes even medicine can not explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, through academic texts, together with my personal experience, I will take the Hindu theory of energy centers (chakras) to explain the lack of emotional stability and the depressive behaviors that invade the lives of human beings. My research focuses on bringing this type of people to an alternative thinking and that, really, becomes aware of the problem you have. This is where one of the most important concepts enters into my research problem: identification. The reality is that the human being in his majority is usually very skeptical and very reserved before remote possibilities of the traditional thing. Identification of a person with a specific topic, can help raise awareness of many things and approach unknown issues breaking the established. That is why, through the construction of a feature film script, I intend to solve my research problem.",

      "abstract": "I have campaigned for many years for the view that most of the traditional arguments for the existence of God can be construed as inductive arguments from phenomena to the hypothesis of theism (that there is a God), which best explains them. Each of these phenomena gives some probability to the hypothesis, and together they make it more probable than not. The phenomena can be arranged in decreasing order of generality. The cosmological argument argues from the existence of the universe; the argument from temporal order argues from its being governed by simple laws of nature; the argument from fine-tuning argues from the initial conditions and form and constants of the laws of nature being such as to lead (somewhere in the universe) to the evolution of animal and human bodies. Then we have arguments from those humans' being conscious, from various particular characteristics of humans and their enivronment (their free will, their capacity for causing limited good and harm to each other and especially for moulding their own characters for good or ill), from various historical events (including violations of natural laws), and finally from the religious experiences of so many millions of humans.",

      "title": "Two Concepts of Responsibility",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores two senses of responsibility: the responsibility we bear for our own actions and decisions or ‘outcome responsibility’, and the responsibility we may have to come to the aid of those who need help or ‘remedial responsibility’. Outcome responsibility provides an important way of identifying remedial responsibility. Outcome responsibility starts with agents and asks how far they can reasonably be credited and debited with the results of their conduct. Remedial responsibility starts with patients — people who are deprived or suffering — and asks who should shoulder the burden of helping them. These two kinds of responsibility reflect contrasting aspects of the human condition: on the one hand, we are vulnerable creatures whose lives may not be worth living unless others are willing to come to our aid and supply us with resources. On the other hand, human beings are choosing agents able to control their actions and to take responsibility for the results. For such agency to exist they must be willing to bear losses and enjoy gains, whether these fall immediately on themselves or on others. The idea of outcome responsibility permits that. It prevents one person, or group of persons, imposing losses on other. At the same time, where losses are self-imposed, it frees other agents from having to make good the deficit.",

Because the subject of the PA's work—the deceased—is no longer present, the office relies on things—objects, homes, money, and documents—as legal markers of identity. The afterlife of a person, therefore, is a distinctly material afterlife. Though death may signify an end, it is in fact the beginning of a different kind of time that is orchestrated in stops and starts by the work of the law, people, and material objects. The ethnographic stories told in this essay demonstrate how two temporal categories—the legal and extralegal—come up against each other in tense and uncanny ways, and how this convergence of legal and extralegal temporalities produces the distinctive material afterlives of the dead.",

      "title": "Leisure Ex Machina: The Leisure Lives of Digital Minds",
      "abstract": "Humans may soon succeed in the creation of sentient artificial intelligence (SAI) that experiences human-like consciousness. Such SAI would have a claim to the same rights and moral considerations afforded to biological humans, including a right to leisure. Particular to this special issue, I explore the implications of such a development from the context of leisure studies; specifically, I apply utilitarian moral theory and the concept of a \"utility monster,\" as an analytical framework to consider the potential for SAI to degrade the wellbeing of humans and non-human animals through their leisure experiences. Throughout this essay, my overarching goal is to provide a thought provoking argument that serves as the context for fruitful reflection and discussion in the field of leisure studies. Due to their potentially superhuman efficiency in deriving benefits (\"utility\") from experiences, SAI may become a \"utility monster,\" or a being with superior moral claim to scarce resources. As SAI will (a) likely be \"human-like,\" and (b) exist independent of the physiological needs/limits inherent to biological humans, it is likely that a large proportion of the experiences chosen by SAI would be categorizable as leisure. Following a utilitarian logic that the only morally acceptable action is the one that raises net utility by the greatest amount, other beings would be morally compelled to transfer all available resources to satisfy the leisure preferences of the SAI utility monster. I examine the implications of this moral quandary for leisure studies and wider society, and discuss three potential paths forward: total transfer of resources to a leisure-focused SAI utility monster; strict limits on the development of SAI; and a middle path where the interests of SAI and humans align. Although the topic of artificial intelligence is increasingly relevant in discussions within our broader society, and specific to the field of leisure studies, to date that conversation has largely focused on how technological advances in artificial intelligence will impact humans, and how that technology can be used in an ethical fashion; this essay refocuses the conversation to the implications for a potential SAI that may look and feel very much like we do.",

We investigated whether enculturated chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) also imitate rationally. Using Gergely and colleagues' (2002) basic procedure, a human demonstrator operated each of six apparatuses using an unusual body part (he pressed it with his forehead or foot, or sat on it). In the Hands Free condition he used this unusual means even though his hands were free, suggesting a free choice. In the Hands Occupied condition he used the unusual means only because his hands were occupied, suggesting a constrained or forced choice. Like human infants, chimpanzees imitated the modeled action more often in the Hands Free than in the Hands Occupied condition. Enculturated chimpanzees thus have some understanding of the rationality of others' intentional actions, and use this understanding when imitating others.",

      "title": "Excitation of visual sensory experiences by electromagnetic fields of lightning",
      "abstract": "Lightning flashes can interact with a human in six different ways [1-3]. These are through direct strikes, side flashes, ground currents, shock waves, connecting leaders, and electromagnetic fields. A direct strike results when the lightning channel terminates on the person's body. In this case, there is a direct current injection from the lightning flash into the body as a result of which the person generally may experience cardiac and/or respiratory arrests; about 20% of the victims die as a result. A side flash happens when the human is located close to an object struck by lightning. The potential gradient created by the current flow along the object may give rise to a discharge between the object and the human. A portion of the lightning current will flow along this discharge path and pass through the body. Depending on the path along which the current travels through the body, the injuries could be similar to that of a direct strike. Someone standing close to the point at which lightning strikes could be injured by ground currents as the current flowing through the ground short-circuits its path by passing into the body from one leg and flowing out from the other. Since the current path is not directly through the brain or the heart, the injuries tend to be less severe than those caused by a direct strike. Injuries can also arise from shock waves created by the lightning channel. During a lightning strike, the channel temperature can rise to about 25,000 K and the channel pressure can increase to several atmospheres. The rapid expansion of heated air creates a shock wave that can injure a person located close to a lightning strike. Someone standing in the vicinity of a lightning strike could also be injured by an aborted connecting leader. Connecting leaders are initiated from grounded objects, including humans, under the influence of the electric field generated by the down-coming stepped leader. The resultant electric field is concentrated on sharp points and on the tips of grounded objects, increasing the electric field at these points to several times the background electric field. In the case of a person standing, the maximum field enhancement would take place on the top of the head. The electric field continues to grow as the stepped leader approaches the ground, and when the electric field at the tip of an object exceeds a critical value, a corona discharge (known in the popular literature as St. Elmo's fire) is initiated from it. This corona discharge continues to grow as the stepped leader approaches the ground and when the charge associated with it reaches a critical level, a thermalized electrical discharge travelling from the tip towards the down-coming stepped leader is formed. Several objects, including humans, in the vicinity of a lightning channel may launch connecting leaders, but only one of them will succeed in joining with the stepped leader. The object that initiated the 'successful' connecting leader will receive a direct strike. As the electric field collapses during the lightning strike, the connecting leaders issued by other objects will be aborted, but the current generated by these aborted leaders could be large enough to cause injury especially if it happened to be created from a person's head. When the person is located at a sufficiently large distance where the electric field is not large enough to launch a connecting leader, a corona discharge may still be issued from the person's head.The electric current passing through the body during a direct strike or during the launch of a connecting leader can be large enough to cause either cardiac arrest or a respiratory arrest, or both. If, however, someone is located at a distance large enough to ensure that they will not be affected by direct strikes, connecting leaders or ground currents, the person can still be affected by the lightning-generated electromagnetic fields and the corona currents generated from the body.In this chapter, we will consider the possible interactions, either direct or indirect, of the lightning-generated electromagnetic fields with the brain or the visual system of humans to induce visual sensations. Some of these visual sensations are known as phosphenes in the medical literature. Since some of these visual sensations could be misinterpreted as ball lightning, this subject is of interest for lightning researchers due to the still unsolved problem of the origin of ball lightning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The humanoids will each have a reputational and prudential motive to treat others well, generating collectively beneficial regularities, and to regulate others as well as themselves for conformity, thereby treating the regularities as social norms. Moreover, they will each manifestly want others to conform to such beneficial norms and so each may aspire without fear of contradiction to speak for all in regulating another, whether in educating them, in enjoining conformity, or in correcting offenders. This will give the demands of their social norms a categorical, if still overrideable status. With those norms manifest—and their acceptance by everyone also manifest—they will each be disposed to commit to conforming and upholding those norms: to bet on themselves to do so, at risk of not being able to excuse a failure by invoking a misleading mind or a changed mind. Indeed, they will be committed to this line just by acquiescing in the expectations of others. Among the attitudes to which they will commit in this active or virtual way is the intention to obey and uphold relevant norms: in effect, to value universal conformity in a decisive way. In that case, they will treat the desiderata that explain the commitment as impartial values. And as they may recognize and commit to such values, so they may do so with more personal or sectional values as well.",

      "title": "What is Property?",
      "abstract": "I have argued that, in order to unearth — or construct — sociological foundations for Marx's economic theories, the two concepts of estrangement and alienation must be kept separate and distinct. In the Introduction, 'alienation' (Entäusserung) was said to refer to the renunciation or relinquishment of possession or of a claim to something — usually, but not necessarily, in favour of another person. Its correlative was said to be 'appropriation' (Aneignung): taking into possession or assuming new powers of disposal over something — often, but by no means always, from another person. Clearly, neither term refers exclusively to relations involving 'things', since it is possible to alienate and appropriate activities or capacities, such as labour and labour-power, or persons (slaves) or abstract social entities (privileges, offices, freedoms, 'goodwill' etc.) However, it is fair to say that their primary reference is to things, and that these other uses, however common, are secondary, and have a figurative content. Or, to put it another way, that these diverse sorts of object are being assimilated to things and treated accordingly when they are said to be alienated or appropriated. So whereas solidarity and estrangement concerned the social bonding and sundering of persons, appropriation and alienation concern the making and breaking of social bonds between persons and things.",

      "abstract": "Whether at a coffee shop, in a waiting room, or riding the bus, people frequently observe the other people around them. Yet they often fail to realize how much other people engage in the same behavior, and that they, therefore, also are being observed. Because it is logically impossible that people, on average, are the subjects of observation more than they are objects of it, the belief that one watches others more than one is watched is an illusion. Several studies show that people incorrectly believe that they observe others more than other people observe them. We call this mistaken belief the \"invisibility cloak illusion.\" People believe that they observe others more than do other people and that they are generally observed less than are others (Studies 1-3, 5, 6). The illusion persists both among strangers in the same vicinity (Study 2) and among friends interacting with one another (Study 3), and it cannot be explained away as yet another general better-than-average bias nor is it the result of believing one has more thoughts, in general, than do other people (Studies 2-3). The illusion is supported by a failure to catch others watching oneself (Studies 1b, 4) and it is manifest in the specific contents of people's thoughts about one another (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, rendering a feature of one's appearance salient to oneself fails to interrupt the illusion despite increasing one's belief that others are paying more attention specifically to that salient feature (Study 6).

This fact can explain why people are so often reluctant to admit wrongdoing, why people place so much importance upon receiving an apology and other behaviors that would be otherwise inexplicable. The unrepentant person uses something akin to a naive economic theory of human behavior. The naive version of homo economicus , or economic man, can never truly be sorry for anything, and as a result, will be almost impossible to live with.

      "title": "To Catch a Predator",
      "abstract": "[D]esire is never renounced, but becomes preserved and reasserted in the very structure of renunciation. --Judith Butler (1) INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, a new term--sexual predator--has arisen to describe criminals who commit sexual offenses against children. We used to refer to such offenders as pedophiles or perhaps molesters. Since this new terminology first emerged in the 1990's, the word has become a term of art in legal regulation, and a mainstay in media reports and in the popular imagination. (2) How did the pedophile become the predator? And what were the effects of this transformation? As the category took shape, a vast new legal apparatus arose to regulate and monitor this emerging species of criminal. (3) New methods developed (4) to detect and scrutinize him. (5) The term implied that the offender was relentless and animal-like; thus, it no longer sufficed merely to send him to jail. After his release, we now had to register him, track him for the rest of his life, (6) or commit him indefinitely to a mental hospital. (7) Some states began to castrate him. (8) Since the term first emerged, its meaning has expanded and mutated to include a broadening array of sex criminals. (9) The category now encompasses a diverse range of offenders, from the most violent child rapists to teens who possess (10) (a term that has an extremely expansive definition in its own right). (11) Indeed, as the category of predator has grown, it has become increasingly unstable. A salient example comes from the recent epidemic of prosecutions, which began in earnest in early 2009. (12) These cases prosecute teens as sex offenders for making child pornography of themselves--taking sexual pictures of themselves with their cell phones and texting them to their friends or sexual partners. Now the teen who creates child pornography of herself is a predator. How did a body of law designed to protect children from predators come to be used against the children it was designed to protect? How did the law come to picture the predator and the victim as one and the same person? I want to suggest that the seeming illogic of the sexting cases--the simultaneous expansion and disintegration of the category that they signal--in fact follows a deeper logic of cultural fantasy and desire. In this paper, I explore that cultural fantasy by turning to a wildly popular television series called To Catch a Predator, which played a dramatic role in shaping the category of in popular imagination, in public policy and in law. My argument is that To Catch a Predator functioned as a realm of regulatory fantasy that served to restrict, produce, and fracture desire. In my view, the show's invocation of the category of predator both constituted and destabilized that category in ways that have shaped the legal discourse on child predation. In this Article, I offer two different but related readings of To Catch a Predator. The first reading pictures the show as producing a kind of disavowed child pornography. The second reading, psychoanalytic in approach, pictures the show as a spectacle of sadomasochism and a scene of oscillating and proliferating desire. Here I focus on the audience's and the predator's shifting pleasure, self-beratement and shame. Ultimately, I suggest that our surprising identification with the predator leads us to disavow that identification through the force of law. Part I describes To Catch a Predator's formula. Part II explores the show's ratings success, its extraordinary influence on public policy, the lawsuits it provoked, and the vociferous criticism it received. In Part III, I offer two different readings of the show as a scene of fantasy. In the first, I argue that the show inadvertently spreads the very spectacle of the sexual child that it seeks to shut down. …",

The conventional view of security is that it subsists in a 'political relation ... between the individual and the political community' to provide minimum conditions of physical safety and the protection of law.1 Such a view belies a very long history of conceptual uncertainty not simply about who is to be secured from whom, or the structure of mechanisms for providing security, but over the moral and even spiritual value of security itself.",

Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior is an important communication tool that has a role in survival, reproduction, and building and maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

This process is universal. It applies equally for those protecting their inclusion privilege, such as belonging to a select group, or trying to acquire membership privilege. Both forces are complementary, under the same fundamental umbrella drive: the need to belong. This need drives relations of self to others from birth, and it is not just motivated by breast or access to food.",

Moreover, He also wants His servants to do so, that is, to love beauty, be beautiful and generate beauty through words, deeds, character, garments, general outward appearance, and the cultural and civilizational creations of theirs. \r\nIn doing so, however, people must subscribe to and apply only the highest heavenly standards of goodness and beauty, without contaminating them with the effects of their intrinsic inadequacies, myopia and whims. It is on account of this that Islam abhors ugliness with all its physical and metaphysical dimensions and features. It does so, for example, as much in evil speech, disposition and conduct, as in ungodly elements of culture, art and architecture.",

      "title": "Innovation needed for means to support the body during prolonged awkward postures",
      "abstract": "In many tasks body parts have to be held against gravity for prolonged periods of time, often in positions other than the usual upright sitting or standing. Because the object that is worked on with hands and or tools cannot be repositioned or reoriented, the worker must adapt, not seldom leading to awkward postures. Lying on the back or lying half flat/half seated looking upwards is seen in machine maintenance. Lying on the chest, face down is seen in agriculture where workers manually plant, weed or harvest. Prolonged forward-bent sitting or standing, is observed in the work of harbour and tower crane operators, and of surgeons. In several areas harnesses or other supportive means are applied. We have indications that users perceive discomfort from the supportive means. They may also feel restrained in the movements they need for correct task execution. The available ergonomic literature reveals little or no scientific evidence about supportive measures and their possible adverse effects. In a poster we will present further examples, indicate problems that might arise with types of body support and discuss relevant aspects that should be put into further research and innovative development. Our aim is to initiate an international project on this matter.",

      "title": "Addiction subordinates the interests of family members and friends",
      "abstract": "Powerlessness, which is so central to the idea of addiction that I am proposing in this book, radiates outwards, impacting those who are most closely connected. In the case of David – one of the three hypothetical cases introduced in Chapter 1 − it is his wife, Marian, who bears the full brunt of this disempowerment at second-hand, along with their three children, parents, brothers and sisters and close family friends. In Amanda's case it is her parents who feel mostly keenly the erosion of control over their lives, as do Amanda's brother and sister and other family members and friends. With Caroline it is her daughter, Karen, and brother, John, who are most affected. Like the other more than 100 million people world-wide who are affected by the addiction problem of someone they live with or are very close to – the number is certainly colossal but only a very rough estimate is possible – they experience a range of uncomfortable feelings as they witness the hold over their relatives exerted by the addictive substance or activity and its power to undermine their own interests. In the course of research by the group that I am part of, in which approaching a thousand affected family members have been interviewed in a number of different socio-cultural groups in four different countries, family members have told us repeatedly how it has made them anxious, depressed and angry. They talk about being worried, preoccupied with thinking about the relative and the problem, feeling nervous and panicky, irritable and quick tempered, low and miserable, annoyed and resentful. They use expressions such as, ‘wrung out’, ‘plays on your mind’, ‘nerves in pieces’, ‘on tenterhooks’, ‘dragged down’, ‘energy level and stamina low’, ‘cheated’, ‘let down’, ‘feelings of love and hate’. It is common for affected family members to feel a failure themselves or devalued. Some say they feel alone in facing the problem. Others feel frightened. It is not at all uncommon to hear thoughts of suicide expressed. It is hard to think of anything much more demoralising than witnessing at close hand a person you love, whose life is closely entwined with your own, and who you know is capable of many good things in his or her life, apparently being taken over by a seemingly senseless attachment to such a harmful form of consumption.",

It is really power in action, “action‐power,” as Popitz says, a way of action, above all of harm, based on the power physically and materially to hurt other creatures or to be harmed. It is determined by the boundless relation of human beings with violence: the motivations for violence are so varied and numerous that they cannot be exhausted by any list. No genetic program limits the violent behavior of humans to certain situations. Anyone can become a perpetrator and no one and almost nothing, neither human nor anything else, whatever category, is safe from victimization. Violence means to kill, to harm, to destroy, to rob, and to expel. These are the five basic forms of violence. All varieties of violence are variants and hybrids of these forms.",

      "title": "On spirit writing: materialities of language and the religious work of transduction",
      "abstract": "This is a speculative essay in comparative possibilities. It looks at some widely separated religious contexts in which a power‐laden relationship across ontological difference – for instance, between living humans and a world of gods or spirits – is mediated by operations on the materiality of the written sign. These operations typically result in either materializing something immaterial or dematerializing something material. But they may also involve other activities that take advantage of specific physical properties of the written word such as being persistent, transportable, perishable, alienable, and so forth. Once divine words are rendered into script, they possess a distinctively material quality and form. They appear on some physical medium, and so are both durable and potentially destructible. Anything that can happen to another artefact can happen to them. The practices I dub ‘spirit writing’ subject the written word to radical transformation, taking advantage of its very materiality in order to dematerialize it, even if only in order to be rematerialized in yet some other form (such as a person's body). Many such practices seek to generate or control religious powers by means of transduction across semiotic modalities, material activities that help render experience‐transcending forces realistic or at least readily imaginable.",

These are traces of blood in various quantities and forms, traces of semen, sweat, hair, feces, urine, vomit, meconium. Because they belong to a human, they are called biological traces of human origin, and since they are most often very small quantities, they are called biological micro traces of human origin. The method of collecting, packaging and processing these traces falls within the scope of the work of the police forensic service, and the found material is processed in forensic and forensic laboratories. The aim of this paper is to examine and explain the importance of biological traces in investigative and criminal proceedings, i.e. their use to determine the identity of the person to whom they belong, the relationship between the victim and the attacker during the commission of the crime, the type of participation in a traffic accident, etc. Thanks to these traces, it is possible to find answers to the questions sought by investigative authorities related to a specific case.",

We can think of politics as those activities and behaviors associated with a group reaching “collective decisions” and with individuals undertaking “collective actions.” The true origin of politics may never be established. Some might believe it comes from our having fallen from grace by eating the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. My perspective leads to more empirical responses. Politics arises because groups of people have to do things together to achieve shared goals such as building a bridge or, under some circumstances, even survival. There are things that we cannot achieve when we remain “unorganized.” This is especially so when groups of individuals share a desire for something costly that they would accomplish as a group. Examples abound but include such things as roads, environmental protection, and law and order. In the social sciences these are known as “public goods.”",

One way of investigating this is to study the context in which the battle axes were manufactured, and by whom. If any object is to serve as a mark of status, it must be possible for someone who wishes to assert his/her superiority over other community members to limit the object’s availability. This limitation may involve a rare raw material, unusual knowledge about its production, time consuming or labour consuming production, etc. My work aims at analysing a number of possible prehistoric status objects, among them the battle axe, in order to ascertain the organisation of the production.

      "abstract": "Human existence begins with weakness and inability which will then move towards strength. Humans can easily take advantage of the grace and gifts bestowed upon them, but humans must fulfill an obligation to their God. Human dignity before God is not measured by how high their rank and position, their lineage, or their wealth. But when Allah is measured, it is his piety. Humans from the Islamic perspective will still be born in a state of fitrah, namely holy, clean, free from all sins, and have a tendency to accept religion, faith and monotheism. Whether humans become good or bad is a result of education and environmental factors, not their original character. According to Abd al-Rahman al-Bani, quoted by an-Nahlawi, the task of Islamic education is to safeguard and maintain the nature of students, then develop and prepare all the potential they have, by directing the existing nature and potential towards goodness and perfection, and realizing a the program in a more gradual manner. (Nahlawi, 1996) Development of human nature can be done through various learning activities. Namely through an institution. The development of human nature can be done through learning activities. Namely through various institutions. What is meant by unfocused learning is through education at school only, but can also be done outside school, either in the family, community or through existing social and religious institutions. From an Islamic point of view, fitrah is a natural innate tendency from birth. The creation of a creature for the first time is in a natural structure, one of which is human, human since the beginning of his birth has had an innate religion or belief that is passed down from his parents. Apart from being a religion of nature, Islam is also in accordance with human religious instincts and even supports the needs and development of nature.",

It is that which is not altered by anything else, any 'other'); the Imaginary (that which exists in the earliest relationship mother/other- but is non verbal and is non symbolised. It exists in another realm, which is kinaesthetic/sensational/emotive); and the Symbolic (which is the realm that the child enters into with the acquisition of language.

      "abstract": "Can one person's mental states, such as intentions or emotions, affect others even in the absence of any action or expression on that person's part? Contrary to a widely shared assumption, I argue for a positive answer. The assumption, I claim, rests on the view that a person's thoughts are by themselves neither knowable by others nor do they have causal efficacy with regard to them. The assumption can be refuted, accordingly, by recognizing other cases in which a person will be said to be affected by an event about which he knows not and in the absence of a causal link. Our willingness to acknowledge that a disaster befell a father whose son was killed in an accident, unbeknownst to him, provides such an example. The account of this case I propose highlights the fact that being a father is a relational property: it is defined in terms of the father's relation to the son, whom I call \"the relational term.\" The accident can be said to have affected the father despite the absence of a causal link because it did causally affect the relational term, i.e., the son. The crucial step in the argument is to recognize that one person's mental state can also be the relational term that defines another's relational property, thus providing a medium for non-causal effects on the latter. The argument has wide normative implications, illustrated by a discussion of the legal treatment of hate speech, and broader philosophical ramifications, concerning \"externalist\" views of the mind and their bearing on the limits of individualism.",

Others are evaluative, like health is better than sickness, happiness better than misery, appreciation better than humiliation, peace better than war, and so on. Such assumptions are about the fundamental conditions of our lives and presupposed by how we respond to the world. Some of them may be mistaken, but if many of them were mistaken, human life would be endangered. We can then test our beliefs, emotions, desires, and evaluations by asking whether they conform to basic assumptions. Part of human wisdom is to know which of the many assumptions we make are basic, which are not, and how to avoid confusing strongly held assumptions, especially evaluative ones, with basic ones.",

Thus the wedding code applied to the incantation turns out to be different from the wedding song itself. The phenomena of anti-speech (insults directed to the bride or to the wedding guests) and of inverse reality of the sacred moment in the incantations become the powerful means against diseases and evil spirits. While modulating the wedding ritual objects (wedding shirt, wreath, veil, flag), or ritual actions (giving gifts, repulsing the wedding guests, taking the bride away from her parents’ house), these objects and acts gain a secondary, magical function that makes diseases and evil spirits drive away. The wedding songs and the incantations share the same model of space in which forest and water introduce themselves as the strong boundaries between two worlds: of the living and of the dead. While in the first case the boundaries are porous, allowing an interpenetration of both the worlds, inthe second one they remain closed off. The above mentioned genres also share some motifs –of a fast growing girl, hospitality (as well as of an uninvited guest) and magical counting. Furthermore, the article proves that various functions determine essentially different meanings of motifs, ritual actions and eventually characters which appear in these folklore genres.",

To be next to something (someone), to be above or below, behind or in front, inside or outside, are existential conditions that give distinct qualities to our actions. T o look out over, to shelter within, to rest against, to stand up to and to face directly are actions we can imagine, actions with generic significance that we all understand. To be able to choose among such conditions is part of being able to be human. We should imbue our buildings and landscapes with occasions for choice. Functionalism and determinism, not modernism, prescribe specific limited actions in a building—for whatever good or evil purposes—and deny, thereby, the expressive potential of relationships between people and things. O f course we do more in a building, in life, than stand about. Architecture, properly done, enables us to reflect upon our position, to imagine our relationship to the building, not just to act it out, and to see the acts of others reflected in a building's form. Architecture has the capacity to nurture our attention, to bring things to mind, to strike associations, and to reward curiosity. Architecture gives us places to inhabit, to make a part of our lives. To take position is a figure of speech used more often w i t h ideas than with things. We take position on the issues of the day, align ourselves for or against the large scale forces and purposes of society. Architects and architecture do that, too. A n d we should do it deliberately. H o w our buildings provide choice for people, what attentions they nurture, w h o m they serve, and to w h o m they can belong, are cultural and political questions of consequence. The positions we take on those questions are embedded in the places we build and give rise to their form. We consider it necessary for architecture to bring attention to people and to place: to make places that are filled w i t h opportunities to choose, that are visibly related to human actions, that sustain detailed attention, that can belong to those w h o use them, and that are related always to the larger place of which they form a part.

These disasters have emerged from human choices and decisions, many of them related to standing by and the complicity that goes with that action. Nothing human, natural, or divine guarantees respect for the ethical values and commitments that are most needed in contemporary human existence, but nothing is more important that our commitment to defend them, for they remain as fundamental as they are fragile, as precious as they are endangered. While existence is shot through with failure, ethics remains and persists. An irreplaceable safeguard, it still possesses the indispensable corrective for its own failures. But ethics meets that test only to the degree that it—and we—confront mass atrocities, inspire protest and resistance against them, support humanitarian responses to the suffering inflicted by those crimes, and strengthen efforts to prevent their recurrence.",

The present paper argues that it is valuable for your conduct in such circumstances to be regulated by a character trait the possession of which constitutes one way of having one’s life be centered upon others as opposed to centered upon oneself. The trait in question, which we shall call “others-centeredness,” is a disposition to promote goods of others rather than one’s own goods when the values of these goods are equal or incommensurable. We argue that possessing this trait makes one more likely to maximize total value, because in addition to promoting the goods of the other, this trait also promotes goods of interpersonal union. We explain why this conclusion is significant, and we defend our argument for it against several objections.",

      "abstract": "Man cannot adapt himself to the complicated environment only with the physical equilibrium created through the physiological or biological processes of growth. However, it is possible for him to adapt himself well to the environment, when the psychological equilibrium be formed on the basis of biological equilibrium. Man acts in various ways in order to maintain such equilibrium. Personality develops itself into a new form through adjustment to the environment, and also through creating a new environment. Human needs should be met adequately to achieve the desirable adaptation to the environment through the continuos processes of control and creation for adjustment. When human needs not be met or met to excess, an emotional instability would result, that is the cause of maladjustment. Psychological mechanism is used to overcome emotional needs and tensions, while anatomical mechanism isused to protect the organization of human body from maladjustment. Especially psychological mechanism appears differently according to the individual; as it were, it appears as the from of mechanisms, of escape, defense, and aggressiveness. Among these there are those accepted socially and those rejected socially. The Mechanisms accepted socially lead to the low level of personality development. Therefore, guidance programs should be made so that pupils may not take the unacceptable mehcanisms.\r\n The following methods are recommended to guide pupils in terms of adjustment mechanism:\r\n 1. To eliminate factors for frustration through controlling conditions of envioronments.\r\n 2. To give the opportunities to evaluate himself, so that he may know whether or not behaviors to meet his needs be acceptable sociallly.\r\n 3. To train perseverance in case the pupil be frustrated psychologically.\r\n 4. To foster ability to determine the adequate standard of psychological needs.",

As anyone familiar with either the Mahabharata or India's second great epic, the Ramayana, knows martial techniques have existed on the South Asian subcontinent since antiquity. Both epics are filled with scenes describing how the princely heroes obtain and use their humanly or divinely acquired skills and powers to defeat their enemies: by training in martial techniques under the tutelage of great gurus like the brahmin master Drona, by practicing austerities and meditation techniques which give the martial master access to subtle powers to be used in combat, and/or by receiving a gift or a boon of divine, magical powers from a god. On the one hand, there is Bhima who depends on his brute strength to crush his foes, while on the other, we find the ‘unsurpassable’ Arjuna making use of his more subtle accomplishments in single point focus or his powers acquired through meditation.",

      "abstract": "Architecture is like a bowl that contains our lives. Therefore, it can be considered the right one only when we can live and do what we like in it without any inconvenience. As more importance has been placed on creating spaces such as roofs or ceiling, and floors, activities and comfort are being more ignored in architecture. Besides, when we assume that convenience and safety are also put into consideration for architecture, it could be only limited to normal and routine circumstances. For those reasons, it is considered that architecture cannot follow the rapid change of its surrounding environment. As our life is uncertain, accidents can occur anytime and anywhere. This is one of the most important factors why architecture should ensure safety at least for such unexpected accidents. Air is a very important element for all living beings to survive, and indoor spaces are the common environment for human beings. An important characteristic of indoor spaces is that they are related directly to the modern life style but it also has a variety of pollutants in it. Indoor air pollution due to various reasons has a negative impact on human health and people are not aware of it. Particularly on children and elder persons who have weaker physical strength and immunity, it has a more serious impact than the one on other people. Nowadays people spend more time indoors than before. Furthermore, the indoor spaces tend to be more enclosed for better privacy, protection and safety. Even when we move from one place to another, we experience being in enclosed spaces such as cars or subway. Especially the efforts of many industries to reduce energy consumption and increase energy efficiency make indoor space more enclosed. In addition, as construction materials composed by chemicals are more used, a variety of issues related to indoor environment air quality arise from materials that before have not been considered problematic. Representative examples are ‘new house syndrome’, ‘indoor air pollution’, and ‘building syndrome’. Indoor air of various spaces such as houses, schools, offices, public buildings, hospitals, underground facilities and transportation is polluted by multiple causes. The truth is that the polluted air has a negative impact on indoor residents in a long term but also it can seriously threaten their life in a short term. It is necessary to look into air quality of buildings which are our shelters and directly connected to our life. Developed countries like the ones in Europe have reinforced the regulations on the use of chemicals and have efficient measures against environmental damages by chemical accidents. Accordingly, Korea should also make efforts to implement preventive, protective and countermeasure systems against chemical mishaps and improve them to protect the national safety and health. Those kind of harmful chemicals keep increasing, and countermeasures should vary for each chemical material. Even the less toxic chemicals could cause a serious damage to environment if there is a high concentration exposure of them in a certain area. For this reason, safety and counteraction manual should be prepared for chemical material and distributed to related organizations so they can take proper actions when accidents take place. Work places that handle chemicals should be properly monitored and the supervisors should receive regular training so they can be aware of the importance of safety. It is not wise to call the doctor after dying. We need the wisdom to be fully prepared for disasters.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety, unlike fear, which is strongly object-related, accompanies man all his life. This anxious condition appears especially then, when danger is imminent, also in the case of being severely ill. Anxiety and hope, even in people severely ill, do not exclude each other. Human life for many and perhaps for all is a race with time. The anxiety not being able to realize enough in a given time often is the reason for a busy and restless activity. Man often suffers from anxiety of other human beings. As ever an individual may live, it always owes something to others. Accordingly, the doctor or other helpers never are able to behave totally in the way as the patient expects and the patient cannot act as the helper truly would like it. Man experiences anxiety, however, also then, when he recognizes to remain in debts towards himself and, in the view of religion, towards a task given by God. Yet, man suffers anxiety not only because of his confrontation with death but also with life and the responsibilities which he has to take over when growing up in society. The struggle for existence described by Darwin, a result of anxiety, seems to be lost for the patient knowing he or she is severely ill, and he/she is therefore upset against a destiny which threatens to exclude him/her from the community of healthy people and perhaps soon from the living persons. Anxiety always turns also around the existence in the group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Normally, a speaker uses a first person singular pronoun (in English, I, me, mine, myself) to refer to himself or herself. To refer to a single addressee, a speaker uses second person pronouns ( you, yours, yourself). But sometimes third person nonpronominal DPs are used to refer to the speaker--for example, this reporter, yours truly--or to the addressee-- my lord, the baroness, Madam ( Is Madam not feeling well?). Chris Collins and Paul Postal refer to these DPs as imposters because their third person exterior hides a first or second person core. In this book they study the interactions of imposters with a range of grammatical phenomena, including pronominal agreement, coordinate structures, Principle C phenomena, epithets, fake indexicals, and a property of pronominal agreement they call homogeneity. Collins and Postal conclude that traditional ideas about pronominal features (person, number, gender), which countenance only agreement with an antecedent or the relation of the pronoun to its referent, are much too simple. They sketch elements of a more sophisticated view and argue for its relevance and explanatory power in several data realms. The fundamental proposal of the book is that a pronoun agrees with what they call a source, where its antecedent constitutes only one type of source. They argue that the study of imposters (and closely related camouflage DPs) has far-reaching consequences that are inconsistent with many current theories of anaphora.",

      "abstract": "The conditional connective -ketun in Korean has some restrictions in both the antecedent clause and the consequent clause. In the antecedent clause the event or state denoted by the predicate must be perceptible. There are some exceptions to this restriction. The exceptional cases are where the event or state denotes a personal feeling on the part of the addressee (or addresser, in some cases). From these observations, it is concluded that the antecedent clause must be an event or state which can be directly experi­ enced by the addressee (or, addresser). In the consequent clause, the mood must be imperative, hortative or promissive. When the mood is declara­ tive or interrogative, the modality must be volitionaL These moods or mo­ dality can be characterized as something that can be satisfied by some ac­ tion on the part of the addresser or addressee. The relation between these two restrictions is that the antecedent clause changes the knowledge state of the addresser or addressee based on direct experience of something, and the addresser or addressee sets a goal and a plan for achieving the goaL And the consequent clause is an action included in the plan.

      "title": "Respect",
      "abstract": "Aretha Franklin asked her man (who she calls her baby) to show her a little bit of R-E-S-P-E-C-T when he came home. In health care, we may have never had more need to consider the implications of maintaining mutual respect between health-care workers, patients and relatives. The word respect has many nuances: it can be used as a noun, to show respect, or as a verb, to respect someone (Fig. 1). We sometimes use the term respect in a loose way, 'Ethics lite',1 either to mean the deference we owe to elders or to denote simple politeness, with the implication that respect must be earned. People cheapen the concept of respect by using the phrase 'with all due respect' when about to say something decidedly disrespectful. But fundamental human respect runs much deeper: it is an obligation on every person to respect the intrinsic dignity of every other person.1 Respect for other humans runs so deep that it continues after death: when Achilles killed Hector, mutilated his body and dragged the corpse behind his chariot, this desecration was outrageously disrespectful. The Ancient Greeks believed a dead body needed to be correctly prepared to find peace in the after-life. The Ethics Centre says: 'Respect for persons may perhaps be the most fundamental principle in all of ethics'.1 The 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant expressed this in terms of never using a person as a means to an end: Kant abhorred slavery. True respect should lead us to oppose discrimination against other persons on any basis: age, gender, sexuality, race or religion. True respect means we should not silence or insult others even when we disagree fundamentally with them. In health care, the need for respect is reflected both in our interactions with families and with colleagues. Families of child patients are often under stress, sometimes the extreme stress of coping with a devastating illness. They may come from a different cultural background from the health care personnel staff caring for their child and may have different expectations. It is beholden on health care staff to ask parents their opinion and to listen to the response. If we disagree, the conversation should always be respectful. The parents' opinion should not be dismissed out of hand, nor should the parents feel belittled. One principle of family-centred care is that the parents should be fully informed and their voice should be heard.2 However, in the event that the parents and doctors fail to reach agreement, there is arguably an obligation on parents to show respect to health-care workers. For 2500 years or more, at least since the time of Hippocrates, doctors have been afforded huge respect by patients and families, but this may be changing. Colleagues working in intensive care in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have remarked on an increase in the number of families challenging medical expertise and talking aggressively to staff. It is extraordinarily confronting for an experienced intensive care nurse to work an entire shift with the parents muttering under their breath: 'You'd think they would give us a nurse who knew what she was doing', as happened at our hospital recently. Some families deliberately praise some doctors or nurses and refuse to let others look after their child, a phenomenon known as 'splitting'.3 Health care workers need to set limits regarding such passive-aggressive behaviour and need to be supported by administrators in doing so. Aggressive parents need to be helped to recognise that treating health-care workers without respect is actually detrimental to the care of their child. With regard to our colleagues, all staff acknowledge the need to treat each other with respect, but we are humans and we transgress.4 An 'operating theatre' sounds like a recipe for drama. Tensions run high during tricky operations. This is no excuse for failing to treat colleagues with respect, both because we owe them respect as fellow humans and because patient care is likely to suffer when surgeons bully nurses and junior doctors. The behaviour of Australian surgeons has been highlighted in the media recently, with allegations of bullying and sexual harassment by individual surgeons and the surgical profession generally.5 A Royal Australasian College of Surgeons working committee found that 49% of surgeons and surgical trainees reported experiencing bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment. The college introduced an operate with respect course, which is mandatory for supervisors.6 While this could make a major difference to behaviour and alter a culture of disrespect for colleagues, it is perhaps significant that a fellow of the college writing an opinion piece praising the college's initiative decided to publish it anonymously.7 Respect is integral to autonomy. It is integral to ending discrimination. It is integral to ending bullying in the workplace. Let us all try to show respect to other people all the time.

      "title": "From Individual Insecurity to Collective Security",
      "abstract": "Individuals are predestined to die, but human groups may persevere for millennia. Because individual humans are inferior to other animals in many physical aspects such as size, strength, speed, and senses, the human ability to coalesce in large and efficient groups has provided humans with an evolutionary advantage. Consequently, humans have been motivated to perpetuate the existence of groups that safeguard their own existence. From this group survival motivation, I draw three hypotheses pertaining to inter- and intra-group relations: First, group survival, not intergroup relations, is the main force driving group behavior. Intergroup conflict resolution interventions that fail to consider implications for group survival may inadvertently compromise group safety by reducing vigilance to collective threats. Second, the memory of collective victimization, often depicted as an obstacle to intergroup conflict resolution, may have group survival advantages in the sense of \"once burned, twice cautious.\" Third, ideological polemics within a group that often seem negative and disruptive may function as a system of checks and balances between different strategies that serve group survival needs. Because the perception of threats and opportunities is contingent on political affiliation, groups that are ideologically diverse may have an advantage in perceiving threats and seizing opportunities. In this chapter, I present research supporting these hypotheses and show how the group survival perspective may help understand burning social issues, from the obstinate nature of intergroup conflict to the strengths and vulnerabilities of liberal democracies.",

      "title": "THE INFALLIBLE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND ITS",
      "abstract": "Fingerprints serve as undeniable physical evidence discovered almost everywhere. These prints are utilized for the purpose of identifying unknown individuals viz. victims, suspects, witnesses, or for verifying records. They also play a crucial role in connecting suspects to crime scenes. These unique, unchanging, universally present, and categorizable pieces of evidence can be found on any object touched with bare hands. When identified and compared, these fingerprints are used as legal evidence in court cases. This practice is founded on the core principle that no two individuals can possess identical fingerprints; in other words, each person's fingerprints are distinctive and serve as a means of personal identification. Over time, numerous innovative techniques have been developed and tested to uncover latent fingerprints. While certain methods are remarkably sensitive and can reveal fingerprints that would have otherwise remained undetected, latent fingerprints are delicate traces that require careful preservation. A crime scene investigator must operate under the assumption that any item taken from the scene may carry fingerprints left by the perpetrator. It is crucial to take appropriate measures to safeguard and uncover such evidence. The quality of latent fingerprints can be influenced by the surrounding environment, often guiding examiners in determining the most suitable detection technique or sequence of techniques for a specific case. Various physical factors, such as heat, diffusion, dust settling, friction, as well as chemical elements like humidity, solvents, and air, can degrade the durability of latent fingerprints. The duration of exposure (or age of the prints) and the presence of bacteria can also contribute to their degradation. Consequently, preserving these prints is of utmost significance for purposes of comparison, classification, and analysis. Despite the existence of various scientific and forensic methodologies, fingerprints still stand out as the most effective means of personal identification within legal investigations. Furthermore, several studies have highlighted gender differences in fingerprints. Thus, utilizing fingerprints to determine gender can aid in streamlining investigations, saving time and resources. Additionally, utilizing the ridge density parameter to analyze sex and population differences can contribute to the field of forensic anthropology, allowing for the study of variability. Moreover, the ridge density parameter can be valuable in determining sex and/or population groups from partial or faint prints recovered from crime scenes, a task that would otherwise be unattainable. Fingerprints also carry huge intriguing connections to various aspects of social sciences, particularly in the fields of criminology, psychology, and anthropology. In criminology, fingerprints play a crucial role, specifically in forensic science and criminal investigations. Each individuals fingerprints are unique, forming distinct patterns that aid in identification. This uniqueness has led to the development of fingerprint databases and automated recognition systems, which assist law enforcement agencies in solving crimes and identifying suspects. The study of fingerprint analysis falls under forensic science and is pivotal in linking individuals to crime scenes. In psychology, fingerprints are linked to studies of identity and individual differences. The concept of fingerprint uniqueness has sparked discussions about how our biological characteristics influence our sense of self and identity. Additionally, fingerprint analysis has been explored in relation to conditions like dermatoglyphics (the study of skin ridge patterns) and potential links to psychological traits such as in the art of palmistry. However, these connections are often considered speculative due to limited empirical evidence. In anthropology, the cultural significance of fingerprints has been examined in various societies. Indigenous cultures and tribes, for instance, have integrated handprints and fingerprints into art, rituals, and symbolism. Anthropologists study how these unique identifiers are woven into cultural practices, offering insights into diverse societies' perceptions of individuality and identity. Overall, fingerprints bridge the gap between individuals' physical uniqueness and broader concepts such as identity, criminal justice, and cultural practices, rendering them a captivating subject of study in the realm of social sciences.",

      "abstract": "In the plays discussed in the previous chapters the forms of deception most favoured by Alarcón are indicative of prudence rather than cunning; they are characterised by concealment rather than ostentation; and they are employed defensively, so as to reveal or confirm the truth about the moral character of others, rather than offensively, with the aim of projecting a flattering but illusory image of the deceiver himself. Moreover, in Alarcón’s plays, prudent deception is invariably concerned with the maintenance of honour-virtue, and the discovery of moral truths, whilst cunning is employed in the pursuit of worldly or sensual goals such as social advancement, riches, and sexual gratification. A circumspect and reasoned approach often proves sufficient to expose the deceptions practised by others, but Alarcón’s protagonists must also learn to overcome the inducement to self-deception presented by the allure of worldly attributes such as beauty, wealth and position, and to regard these as irrelevant or illusory, and this kind of desengaño requires a higher degree of wisdom.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), while offering a powerful foundation for developing natural language agents, raise safety concerns about them and the autonomous agents built upon them. Deception is one potential capability of AI agents of particular concern, which we refer to as an act or statement that misleads, hides the truth, or promotes a belief that is not true in its entirety or in part. We move away from the conventional understanding of deception through straight-out lying, making objective selfish decisions, or giving false information, as seen in previous AI safety research. We target a specific category of deception achieved through obfuscation and equivocation. We broadly explain the two types of deception by analogizing them with the rabbit-out-of-hat magic trick, where (i) the rabbit either comes out of a hidden trap door or (ii) (our focus) the audience is completely distracted to see the magician bring out the rabbit right in front of them using sleight of hand or misdirection. Our novel testbed framework displays intrinsic deception capabilities of LLM agents in a goal-driven environment when directed to be deceptive in their natural language generations in a two-agent adversarial dialogue system built upon the legislative task of \"lobbying\" for a bill. Along the lines of a goal-driven environment, we show developing deceptive capacity through a reinforcement learning setup, building it around the theories of language philosophy and cognitive psychology. We find that the lobbyist agent increases its deceptive capabilities by ~ 40% (relative) through subsequent reinforcement trials of adversarial interactions, and our deception detection mechanism shows a detection capability of up to 92%. Our results highlight potential issues in agent-human interaction, with agents potentially manipulating humans towards its programmed end-goal.",

Looking at human behavior, we can distinguish two basic forms of construction.

When I remember the house in which I spent my childhood or a remote country I sometimes visit, I reproduce traces of the impressions I obtained in early childhood or at a time of a journey. In general, in all these cases this activity of mine is not creating anything new; basically, it is more or less just a return of what was.",

      "abstract": "The formation of Muslim personality as an ummah is a person who is ingrained in the ukhuwah Islamiyah, so that they always do good and prevent evil by adhering to the Qur'an and Sunnah of the Prophet. In the Qur'an there is a change in the form of the word ummah, which shows ummatan wahidah, which shows a unity that is not divided because of differences in ethnicity, race and culture. Ummatan wasathan is a moderate ummah, khoiru ummah is a superior ummah, baldatun thayyibatun is a prosperous country, ummatan muqtashidah which describes an ummah that is not extravagant. The research method is a library research. There are four characteristics of library research, namely: 1) research deals directly with text (manuscripts) or numerical data and not with direct knowledge from the field or eye witnesses in the form of events, people or other objects, 2) library data is ready to use (ready mode), 3) library data are generally secondary sources and 4) library data is not limited by space and time because it is already \"dead\" data stored in written records. So in this study using library research. The personal application of Muslims as an ummah is to shape the personality of Muslim individuals so that they become human beings who are submissive and obedient to Allah, prioritizing His interests over other interests in the sense that they do not wish to become human beings who are negligent in remembering Allah SWT. So when a child lives in a religious family, of course, after joining the community, he is not easily influenced by the western lifestyle, because the values of Islamic teachings are instilled, which are guided by the Al-Qur'an and the Sunnah of Rasulullah SAW. Therefore, the Prophet recommended that in choosing a mate, Islam teaches to be selective because it will give birth to generations who are expected to become caliphs on earth, as servants who are submissive and obedient to the commands of Allah SWT.",

What that caring involves, what it demands of us in regard to non-humans or, for that matter, humans, is, by contrast, not liable to a single, rationally compelling solution. Reasonable, well-intentioned people disagree. Thus, though it may seem and undoubtedly is in many cases a mere bias that humans give priority to their own interests, this need not be the case. For one thing, in giving preference to another human, a person may act against her own interests, as in the case of a pet-lover who saves from a burning house the landlord she despises rather than the cat she adores. For another, such decisions may be rooted in reasons of the sort explored in chapter one.",

Thanks to the wonders of quantum mechanics, the cat is both alive and dead — “mixed or smeared out in equal parts” — until the box is opened, at which point the act of observation causes its state to collapse into either life or death. Far away in the Mojave Desert, the “life” of a six-foot-tall cross is disputed: it is either a religious symbol or it is not. Like the cat, it has spent much of its life (or non-life) in a box that makes direct observation impossible. Is the cross, like the cat, both alive and dead? And does opening the box — either metaphorically or otherwise — cause it to become one or the other? This short Article argues that recent forays into “constitutional physics” may have over-emphasized the role of box-opening judges, and thereby elided the cat’s predicament and the relationship between legal and social reality.",

The fact that words can have such potent, pernicious effects is puzzling, because they are, after all, just words. As the schoolyard chant goes, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.” Words do hurt though—not only one’s feelings, but one’s social status, even one’s basic dignity as a human being. How can sounds and shapes do all that? Many philosophers have thought of language as a kind of game. Both games and language are complex, abstract structures that are deployed strategically to achieve serious goals, as well as for fun. Thinking through these similarities can illuminate how something so intangible can have such powerful effects. And seeing how people wield that power for malicious ends can reveal how to turn the tables and fight back.",

This poem occurs in Kālidāsa’s dramatic work The Recollection of Śakuntalā. Indian poets and critics have cited it for centuries, using it to get to the heart of rasa. In the play, a young warlord on a hunting expedition encounters a girl, Śakuntalā, who has been raised in a cloistered forest ashram by her mendicant father. Prince and girl fall for each other and consummate their love in a wooded glade. By India’s old conventions, this is a “gandharva wedding”—a ceremony sanctified by the gandharvas, celestial musicians who watch over human love. The young couple strolls through the woods after their lovemaking and literally trip across a severe recluse, disrupting his meditation. In a fit of rage, the powerful yogin hurls a curse: when the prince returns home, no matter his vows, all memory of Śakuntalā will be obliterated. In a subsequent scene, the warlord is back in his life of wealth and rank when he hears a strain of music drift through the palace. A former lover of his plays on a musical instrument in her far-off quarters, the song a subtle reproach for his neglect of her. His heart, unexpectedly pierced, becomes paryutsuka, troubled, full of longing, brimming with uncertain desire and regret. The audience knows that a trace of Śakuntalā, some thin strand of passion, runs through his body, too buried by the curse to rise into consciousness. It is at this moment in the play—most likely accompanied by ceremonial dance—he recites, ramyāṇi vīkṣya … For poets, the stanza is the perfect isolation of rasa, bedrock emotional territory that underlies our surface passions. The purpose of poetry is to access that subconscious material, to provide a “taste” of the underlying white-hot encounter with what’s real. To the philosopher this taste is a “foretaste” of spiritual liberation. Most Indian accounts of the origins or the purpose of art have proceeded from the concept of rasa, ever since the Kashmiri poet-philosopher Abhinavagupta set down its metaphysical basis in the tenth- or eleventh-century treatise Abhinavabhāratī. The eight (or at times nine or ten) rasas are the names of emotional states: erotic love, humor, [End Page 43] grief, rage, revulsion, horror, heroism, and wonder. Laid out in a visual psychology, each has a color, a direction, a deity, a time of day or year, and many other associations. Originally meaning juice, sap, semen, rasa came to mean the essence or life-juice of anything, its “taste.” René Daumal translated rasa as saveur. The questions raised by this poem edge into psychoanalysis, evolutionary biology, and ecology. What is the wild unnamed edginess a person approaches in art? Why should things of beauty provoke desire instead of allay it? How far does memory reach, and through it do we actually touch other persons? How is art able to make us feel as though we’ve brushed against former life memories? The poem uses technical terms hard to match closely in English. Ramyāṇi are things that are gorgeous because they provoke bodily desire, from the verbal root ram, to make love. The bhāva-sthirāṇi are deep-seated personal emotions—almost “complexes”—at the core of the individual...",

Two primary forms of activity, maintaining order and putting in order, are analysed. The first is making thin people into order and overweight people into disorder, and thus maintains order in the weight order. The other, putting in order, covers different activities supposed to make sure that people keep their bodies thin or try to become thin. These ordering activities meet resistance when overweight people stop dieting and/or define overweight as a personal choice and themselves as good enough, or even healthy and beautiful. We call these forms of resistance alternative weight-doings.",

      "abstract": "The question raised in The Sunflower, by force of the faiths of the victim and the wrongdoer (Simon and Karl respectively), implicates a need for exploration of the different apprehensions of the concept of forgiveness in Christianity and Judaism, and warrants, at once, its secular interpretation and understanding. I begin with a multidisciplinary discussion of the literature, and then turn my attention to the theology of forgiveness. Theorists, particularly Hannah Arendt (1958, 32) and Bishop Butler (1970, 72)), insist that there are necessary and sufficient conditions for forgiveness, and that these conditions are partly moral, metaphysical, and existential. One obvious condition requires that a culpable wrong be committed for forgiveness to be relevant, and that both victim and offender be moral agents (the concept of forgiveness would be senseless in a world comprised of stones, fish, and vegetables). Thus once a harmful act has been committed, forgiveness acts as a mechanism that interrupts the damages inflicted, and mitigates the stimuli to react or seek revenge. But once a great harm has been done, the mere act of forgiveness may lack the capacity to make whole or redeem the victim from what Arendt described as “the predicament of irreversibility – of being unable to undo what one has done”(Arendt 1958, 40). Arendt acknowledges this limiting power of forgiveness, but insists that forgiveness, in spite of its limitations, remains the solution for the “inevitable damages resulting from action, which, rather than undoing actions, interrupts their consequences;” without forgiveness we would remain the victim of our own behavior “confined to one single deed from which we could never recover.” (Arendt 1958, 241). In this sensibility of forgiveness, it terminates that which could go on pointlessly and endlessly without interference.",

The word culture comes from the Sanskrit word buddhayah”, the plural form of buddhi which means mind or intellect (Koentjaraningrat, 2005). J.J. Honingmann in his book The World of Man (1959) distinguishes the existence of three cultural phenomena, namely ideas, activities, and artifacts. This is then confirmed by the opinion of Koentjaraningrat (2009) which states that there are three forms of culture, namely; (1) the form of culture as a complex of ideas, values, norms, rules and so on.

It is abstract, cannot be touched or photographed, its location is in the head, or in other words, in the minds of the people in the community where the culture resides. The second form of culture is called a social system, regarding the patterned actions of humans themselves. This social system consists of human activities that interact, relate and associate with each other in every second, day and year, accordingly to certain patterns based on customary behavior. The third form of culture is called physical culture, taking the form of all physical products and activities, actions and works of all humans in society. They are most concrete in nature and are in the form of objects or things that can be made, seen, and photographed.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores two ways in which evaluations of an agent's character as virtuous or vicious are properly influenced by what the agent finds salient or attention-grabbing. First, we argue that ignoring salient needs reveals a greater deficit of benevolent motivation in the agent, and hence renders the agent more blameworthy. We use this fact to help explain our ordinary intuition that failing to give to famine relief (for example) is in some sense less bad than failing to help a child who is drowning right before your eyes, in a way that's compatible with the contention that there's no principled reason to see the one life-saving act as any more or less choiceworthy than the other. Second, we argue that alleged 'virtues of ignorance' (modesty, believing better of friends than the evidence supports, etc.) are better understood as 'virtues of salience'. Rather than placing demands on what we believe, these virtues place demands on what we find salient.",

      "abstract": "Humans create social closeness with one another through a variety of shared social activities in which they align their emotions or mental states towards an external stimulus such as dancing to music together, playing board games together or even engaging in minimal shared experiences such as watching a movie together. Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (Study 1) and a conspecific (Study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster or spend more time in their proximity than when they had attended to something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is present in both humans and great apes and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected.",

Any creator (artist or scientist) has recourse above all to the good psychological personality defense mechanisms, such as compensation, regression in the service of the Self or sublimation. Even when one regresses to bad defense mechanisms, like any other human being, the latter fail to prevent the process of creation as such. The sublimation of the premorbid structure of the personality remains for each creator, artist or scientist a question of life and death. Our analysis also demonstrates that the rebus of the relationship between compensation, overcompensation or the highest artistic sublimation remains a fundamental question to address the bottom of the secret of all human creation.",

      "title": "Externalities, Social Networks, and the Emergence of Norms: A Critical Analysis and Extension of James Coleman’s Theory",
      "abstract": "Externalities, Social Networks, and the Emergence of Norms: A Critical Analysis and Extension of James Coleman’s Theory Karl-Dieter Opp (bio) INTRODUCTION Norms are pervasive in everyday life. They specify what is allowed, prescribed, or prohibited. Many norms are stated explicitly, such as laws, which are often well known. This holds for many paragraphs of the penal code. Most norms, however, are not explicitly formulated, and sometimes we are not even aware of them. For example, when people meet and have a conversation, it is the rule to keep a certain physical distance from each other. This rule is automatically followed, and many are not aware of it. When we encounter a friend, we address him or her in a certain way, we talk about specific themes (and not about others), and say goodbye using certain linguistic expressions. In former times, duels took place according to specific rules. The study of social norms—be they formal or informal—is a central theme of all social sciences. In sociology, for example, a classic study is William Graham Sumner’s Folkways (1906), which provides a detailed description of a great number of norms. [End Page 167] One of the goals of social scientists is to find out what the existing norms in a society are, how they differ among groups, and how they change over time. These are descriptive questions. Another goal is explanation. One wants to know the conditions for the emergence of norms. For example, how can we explain the emergence and change of norms or systems of norms (sometimes called “institutions”) such as table manners, norms at the workplace, or norms about the behavior of men toward women? Another question concerns the explanation of the effects of norms. In answering this question it is assumed that norms have come into being, and the effects of their existence are explored. For example, if tax law is changed so that more income tax must be paid, one may ask about the effects this has on tax evasion. Most existing theories of norms deal with their effects. In this essay, we address the origins of norms. One of the most important theories about norm emergence was proposed by James S. Coleman (1990, chaps. 10 and 11). This theory is widely discussed in the literature (Berger 1998; Braun and Voss 2014, 82–89; Cherkaoui 2007; Elster 2003; Ermakoff 2017, 176–78; Frank 1992, 148–52; Horne 2009; Lüdemann 2000; Opp 2001, 2002, 2015b; Voss 1998, 2000, 2001, 2017). There is further a detailed empirical test of a central proposition of the theory (Piskorski and Gorbatâi 2017). James Coleman (1926–1995), an American sociologist, was one of the most eminent sociologists in the history of the discipline. His work focused on social science theory (with his major work, Foundations of Social Theory, published in 1990). His theoretical approach was what is called today structural (or methodological) individualism. The basic assumption is that societal phenomena (such as revolutions) are brought about by individuals and should therefore be explained by going back to individual action. Coleman’s writings are particularly clear. This is probably due to his strong mathematical orientation and his contributions to mathematical sociology (see, e.g., Coleman 1964). But Coleman was not only a theorist. He conducted important empirical studies as well. An example is the Coleman Report from [End Page 168] 1966, “Equality of Educational Opportunity” in the United States. The sample consisted of more than 650,000 students. There are other theories about norm emergence. I selected Coleman’s theory because it focuses on the most important causes for norms, namely externalities and social relationships, as will be shown below, and because it is the only theory that proposes an elaborate causal model. (I will briefly compare Coleman’s theory with some other theories after the exposition and discussion of Coleman’s theory in the final section.) Nonetheless, the theory is not without fault. I focus in particular on two issues: first, the argument that one of the major factors in Coleman’s theory, namely social relationships, contributes to the emergence of norms only under certain conditions; and second, that Coleman addresses only norms that are consciously created...",

In some sense, all people have disabilities: none of us is perfect. There are a range of 'animal powers' that people do not have as keenly as other animals do. This sense of the animal strengths that humans lack combined with a sense of entitlement means that in our perennial disability we are inclined to harvest, or coopt, or borrow, or steal some aspect of those abilities, that able-ness, from other creatures.",

      "abstract": "One of Epicurus' central concerns is to show how human agency exists within a world whose ultimate constituents are simply extended and indivisible bits of matter (atoms) whizzing around in empty space (the void). A common way of putting this concern is to say that Epicurus wishes to defend free will against the threat of determinism. After all, the Epicurean poet Lucretius asserts that libera voluntas - often translated as 'free will' - is incompatible with causal determinism, and Epicurus (famously or infamously) posits an indeterministic atomic motion, the 'swerve', in order to defend our freedom against this threat. However, framing the issue this way risks anachronistically oversimplifying and distorting the Epicurean position. First of all, Epicurus defends at least three different sorts of freedom: \"(a) Effective agency, our ability to act as we wish to in order to get what we desire. / (b) Self-formation of character, our ability to modify our desires, hopefully in a way that allows us to attain happiness. / (c) Moral responsibility, our ability to be justifiably subject to praise and blame for what we do.\"",

Historically, origin of mobbing among humans is attributed to the Darwinian struggle for survival by Konrad Lorenz. He observed similar behaviors among birds and other animals and believed that humans adapted the innate impulse via evolution with an excellent ability of rational control. The ultimate goal of mobbing is often to isolate and force the target to leave the workplace. Hence, the mobbing group may use a variety or combination of methods, which include physical and mental manipulations to disgrace the target via humiliation, intimidation, spreading rumors, discrediting, and innuendo behaviors. The consequences of mobbing techniques and strategies are so severe that mobbing is categorized as a major public health issue since it may result in negative mental and physical health effects.",

No matter where he looked, Paul observed relationships distorted by the on-going and ever-present quest for self-preservation, together with the consequent abuse of power that all too often characterizes that quest. Paul saw this same pattern of distorted relationality repeated in every area of life. This essay teases out the character of the relational distortion that Paul found lying at the heart of the problem that required God's salvific intervention. Profitable advances into understanding Paul's view of \"the problem\" can be achieved if we place our focus on a single motif: power. But that motif includes within itself at least two separate but interrelated phenomena that, for Paul, lie at the heart of all that had gone wrong within God's good creation. Those two phenomena are: (1) the abusive application of power within patterns of dysfunctional relationship, and (2) human inability (or the lack of power) to offset those abusive applications of power.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge is part of human nature.Much of man's search or quest is to know or have knowledge on one thing or the other.Wisdom (knowledge) is the principal thing (Proverbs 4:7).Man is by nature apt to know and to have knowledge of the abstruse things and situations in the universe that he finds himself.But there are some issues, characteristics, instances and situations that militate the free-flow of knowledge acquisition.In effect, when one begins to abhor knowledge and embrace ignorance it is abnormal.When one begins to select what he should know at the expense of other knowledge, then he is losing some sort of knowledge.Knowledge is the pursuit and possession of clarity, certainty and truth for the solution of human problems.Hence, lack of the zeal to know and/or lack of knowledge and knowledge by selection make one less knowledgeable, less informed, less successful and less human -'my people perish for lack of knowledge (wisdom)'.In this paper, attempts are made to outline the factors that hamper and terminate knowledge in human beings as teachers and/or learners.",

      "abstract": "Over much the greater part of its area, the physical city is the result of the co6rdinated action of housing and city planning, each also acting and counteracting upon the other.Each is affected by the operation of forces that do not play upon the other, but each is subject to influences that also control or affect the other.Some approximate definition of these two terms is necessary.Such de- finitions are doubtless given in the papers that precede or succeed this one, but both city planning and housing are in a state of flux, and individuals use the terms with different interpretations.Housing covers places where people live-places that used to be called &dquo;homes&dquo; and that still are called homes in the country and in parts of cities.But a flat does not have that sense of family life separated and shut off from all the world oustide, that sense of peace and happiness and aloofness, and comfortable security, that the word &dquo;home&dquo; brings to one that has known an abiding place other than a flat.But, nevertheless, it is the many-inhabited flat, the tenement, that has caused the rise of the housing inquiry, an inquiry that is gradually creating a knowledge that has something of the character of a science.The forms of living are too various to permit such an investigation to develop a strict science, but certain of the details of housing, such as the amount of cubic space of air that each room should contain per each individual, are rapidly becoming, and in some cases have become, scientifically understood; and that under- standing is being formulated into statutory law.Housing is not generally regarded as applying to buildings intended for business, commerce, manufacturing, transportation or similar business.City planning is concerned primarily with what the public au- thorities do, or with what they can control, such as the street and other transportation systems, the recreation system, the dock sys- tem.It is in certain details that its direct action upon housing is most apparent.",

      "abstract": "Currently available research on dehumanization suggests that the antecedents of dehumanization can be attributed to two intrinsic causes at the cognitive and emotional levels, and three extrinsic causes at the level of power of others, external threats, and social relations. Such behavior of dehumanization and objectification of others, where we spend some attention to discover the common ground, may eventually lead us in one direction: Fear. When a person feels weak and threatened, he/she tends to do things that don’t see others as human beings to vent their aggression. In modern civilization, all human behavior stems from only two different, most fundamental motives, one of which is motivated by love and one by fear. Love is a product of the evolution of the human mind and consciousness, while fear governs the most basic physiological and survival needs of human beings.",

In other words, every object that exerts a force on another object is always acted upon by a reaction force. The extent to which the fundamental natural laws of classical mechanics is applicable to the human condition and social work has been open to questioning since general systems theory married the ecological approach in the 1980s, and even subject to ridicule since the arrival of the newest kid on the block: chaos theory (alias non-equilibrium/self-organisation/complex systems theory) (Hudson, 2000:215,219).

      "title": "The Goodness of Creation, Evil, and Christian Teaching",
      "abstract": "The Thomist 64 (2000): 239-69 THE GOODNESS OF CREATION, EVIL, AND CHRISTIAN TEACHING1 PATRICK LEE Franciscan University Steubenville, Ohio It is at least a very venerable doctrine in Catholic circles that evil as such is a privation. That is, while there are evil things, what makes them evil (evil as such) is a lack of being that is due the thing. The simple example of blindness, a favorite in metaphysics and theology texts, illustrates the doctrine. Blindness is real, but it is not a nature or actuality; it is the lack of sight. Moreover, it is the lack of sight in a thing which is due sight-the lack of sight in a rock or a tree, for example, is not a privation but a mere negation and is not evil. As there are various types of beings, so there are various types of privations. There are privations in the physical domain (sickness, death, etc.), in the intellectual domain (ignorance and error), in the technological domain (inefficiency, malfunctions), and in the moral domain (omissions, commissions, vices, etc.). In this article I first argue that the position that every entity, accidents as well as substances, actions as well as other types of beings, is good to the extent that it is actual, and that therefore evil as such is negative, is immediately entailed by Catholic teaching. That is, although the thesis that evil as such is a privation is not defined,2 it can be inferred by a simple argument from defined teaching. No other position on evil is compatible with what the Church has defined. Second, I present philosophical and 1 I am grateful to John Crosby, Norris Clarke, S.J., Kevin Flannery, S.J., James T. O'Connor, and Germain Grisez, for reading and criticizing earlier drafts of this article. 2 Yet the proposition that evil is not a nature is defined (see below, p. 4). 239 240 PATRICK LEE theological arguments to support and explain the position that evil as such is a privation. Third, I examine objections to this position, and, finally, I indicate in some detail its practical import for theology-for this doctrine has a profound impact on how one views sin, salvation, and God himself. I Few people hold all of the doctrines that the ancient or mediaeval Gnostics or Manichaeans held. Everyone is aware that it is incompatible with Christian doctrine to hold that all matter is evil, or that there is a supreme, independent, evil god, a \"god of darkness.\"3 However, in reply to these heresies the Church not only rejected Manichaeism as a whole system but also made it clear that it is part of revealed doctrine that all being other than God, to the extent that it is actual, is from God, and is therefore good. The Manichaeans held that there was an evil god and a good god, that matter was the creation of the evil god and was evil, and that procreation was evil insofar as it subjected another spirit to matter and the god of evil. Salvation involved liberation from matter. The Church was concerned, almost from the beginning of her existence, to distinguish the Christian doctrine on creation from such views. Scripture seems quite clearly to teach that all of creation is good. Everything other than God is, for as long as it exists, held in being by God: ''Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom all things are and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and through whom we exist\" (1 Cor 8:6). \"For from him and through him and for him are all things\" (Rom 11:36).4 / The ancient professions of faith proclaim belief in God, who is Creator, \"of all things visible and invisible.\" Some of these professions make explicit the teaching that all creatures are good, 3 However, perhaps some people's notions of Satan approach this, inadvertently. See the Sacred Congregation on Divine Worship's decree in 1975, \"Les formes multiples des superstitions,\" translated in Austin Flannery, O.P., Vatican Collection, vol. 2, More Post-Conciliar Documents (Collegeville, Minn.: The Liturgical Press, 1982), 456ff. 4...",

      "abstract": "Academic debates persist about the psychology of suicide terrorists, with one view being that they are psychologically healthy individuals who primarily engage in altruistic self-sacrifice to serve their family, organization, or cause. Some proponents of this view now argue that suicide attackers are actually responding to their evolved sacrificial tendencies. However, the present review questions this hypothesis. For one thing, it appears inconsistent with the evidence on which individuals become suicide bombers and why. More broadly, research from the animal kingdom suggests that there is an important limit to “selfless” or “altruistic” behavior among non-human mammals, which appear to have been naturally selected to save themselves rather than deliberately give up their lives to protect offspring from predation, infanticide, or starvation. Furthermore, kin selection theory suggests that intentional self-sacrifice would be maladaptive for virtually all mammals, including human beings, and that this behavioral tendency would not have been naturally selected after all.",

Some common images of memory include wax writing tablets or books, signet rings, bird cages, storehouses, and so forth.2 To be sure, all these images have different purposes in the ancient discourse on memory: the wax tablet pressed by a signet ring provides an image of the similarity between our memory of a thing and the thing itself; casting about in a cage for one particular bird suggests the process of trying to retrieve one particular memory out of many, perhaps similar ones; the orderly house or city corresponds to a properly trained and organized",

It includes things done without thought or control. If we combine the two we can come to some very healthy conclusions. First, that we tend to use words, and these include creativity and madness, rather loosely, often, in contrast to what they actually mean, and in contrast to what can take us from mediocrity to greatness. Second, that all sensible human beings want happiness and abundance. People are miserable when their thoughts and deeds are poor. Third ,that we have to leave the mentally ill in the care of specialist doctors. It is not a topic we can resolve. Fourth, that every human being is creative. He can achieve great things if he is trained to use his mind wisely. We tend to use madness rather loosely. Most of us clamor to be in madly in love without realizing that mad men cannot sustain love. We are also mad when we indulge in negative emotions. Hysteria is nothing but extreme or uncontrollable excitement. It is a mental disorder. Madness in art and literature is often linked with genius. In reality, it is completely anti-life. Art is selective recreation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgment. Literature re-creates reality by means of language. The most important principal of the esthetics of literature was formulated by Aristotle, who said that fiction is greater that history, because history represents things as they are, while fiction represents them as they might be and ought to be.

The cases, that is, suggest that one cannot be morally blameworthy for performing an action unless one is autonomous with respect to that action, or one is autonomous with respect to the motivational underpinnings (the desires perhaps) that figure in the etiology of the action. Here is a typical, fanciful example. Unbeknownst to Bond, a minute electronic device has been implanted in his brain. Maxine can use the device to induce desires or intentions in Bond without her electronic manipulations being ‘felt’ or detected by Bond. Suppose Maxine implants in Bond a powerful desire to kill Oskar, a distant associate of Bond, together with the belief that the desire is irresistible. Though the electronically induced desire is not in fact irresistible, Bond could resist it only with a great deal of difficulty and only at the expense of suffering considerable psychological damage; Bond, to his astonishment, acts on this desire and does away with Oskar. This case (call it ‘Secret Agent’) is one in which Bond, it appears, is not morally blameworthy for killing Oskar. According to one strand of thought, the judgment that Bond is not blameworthy rests squarely on the view that Bond acts on a desire that is not truly his own;1 Bond is not his own master with respect to the implanted desire that causes him to kill Oskar.",

      "abstract": "Might we become God? Some methodological remarks on theosisCzy mo¿emy staae siê Bogiem?Kilka uwag metodologicznych na temat theosisYearning for God has been an inherent part of the human heart since the beginning of its existence, both on an individual and communitarian level of the whole mankind.The man wants God, His gifts, necessary to live, and God Himself to build strong bonds.Only God seems to provide the permanence of such bonds where there is no place for disappointment or exploitation.To yearn for God is to yearn for the good and happiness in the face of the evil and misery that are revealed despite tireless efforts and actions taken to avoid them; this is yearning for something which is stable despite changeability and the bulk of events taking place every day.Yearning for God provides the feeling of safety, peace, stability and sense in senseless actions or against all set conventions and expectations.This yearning is not influenced by finding God.It anticipates this finding very strongly.At first the man wants God, he craves for knowing God and living with God, and later on he finds God.The more he finds, the more he satisfies this incredible desire.God is not the objective of the human actions: it is not the man who seeks God, it is God who allows the man to perceive.God gives Himself to the man as far as possible.Hence, searching for God requires time and it emerges in the human life as a ceaseless process in which God speaks to the man in a way to be understood so that he accepts divine revelation.The priority of God should be emphasized out of necessity: this is God who goes to the man and attracts him.Being with God means not only natural fulfillment but supernatural as well.Eternal communion with God is the gift of grace where nothing that the man achieves results from what he/she is entitled to on account of his/her being.God gives Himself as the first one, gradually.This way He might want the man to get used to Him.If the sin described in Genesis means breaking off relations with the good and separation from the good, the return requires time not to kill the man with this lost and regained goodness.",

      "title": "FALSE RECOGNITION OF UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE: \"SEEING FILM STARS EVERYWHERE\"",
      "abstract": "Abstract A patient (MR) is reported who is able to correctly recognise famous people as being familiar but has a strong tendency to falsely recognise unfamiliar people as being familiar. False recognition does not depend on the type of person involved (contemporary, historical, fictional) or the modality in which it is presented (face, spoken/written name). False recognition does not extend to vocabulary knowledge, to other proper name categories (e.g. places) or to news events. Several hypotheses are considered but discounted. False recognition does not reflect reliance on familiarity associated with parts of the stimuli as opposed to the whole. False recognition, instead, depends critically on the nature of the referent (i.e. whether it refers to a person or not) and not on the nature of the stimulus material. Thus, MR will not produce false recognition when asked to search for names that refer to song or book titles even when, in all other respects, the stimuli resemble the names of people (e.g. Eleanor Rigby, David Copperfield). It is suggested that this disorder stems from a top-down failure to regulate the person recognition system, such that inappropriate information is retrieved. The category specificity may reflect inappropriate use of meta-memory knowledge concerning the rate of potential new exemplars from the category of \"people\" relative to other categories.",

It occur because of congenital or by accident. Quadriplegic by accident has experienced a tragic incident, create a normal individual to become an individual as a disabled person, resulting in many obstacles who experience barriers in achieving goals or goals in his life. In Cimahi rehablitation hall most of the behavior of the quadriplegic indicates they have goals to be achieved in despite of having shortcomings in the body. The Center is an implementation unit to optimize the physical, mental, and social function of persons with disabilities in order to perform their functions properly. According to Victor Frankl’s the meaningfull of life is the appreciation of the individual towards his existence, contains things that are considered important, felt valuable, and can give special meaning that became the purpose of life, so as to make the individual become meaningful and valuable. This study uses descriptive study method with the subject amounted to 20 persons with quadriplegic. The measuring tool used is a derivative questionnaire from the aspects of meaningful life Viktor Frankl with a reliability level of 0.948 means reliability is very high. The results showed from 20 subjects as many as 18 subjects have a meaningful life and 2 other subjects have not found meaning in his life.

      "abstract": "What do we see when we see something beautiful? Why do we feel like for certain objects, situations, people or environments and repulsion for others? Why do we want what we want? Is desire free? These questions and others arise from the urgent current need to think about a different and supportive world, different from the one we currently have which is in crisis, due to a pandemic that is nothing more than the reflection of a lifestyle that, not only was putting in check to nature - innumerable animal and plant species extinct by human footprint - but also to human life. If we reflect on what brought us to this situation, we will realize that the foundation of this crisis is found in an exacerbated hedonism, in the insatiable search for enjoyment and in the bottomless well of desires.\nBut obviously the problem is not enjoying or wishing, the problem is not knowing what, how and why we want, especially if we consider that this enjoyment often leads to the suffering of others. Obesity in some —which is already an approach to death— implies hunger in others —the systematic presence of painful death—, just to give one example. If this is so, then It is evident that our aesthetic direction is not only unclear, but it goes against our own life; But this was not a simple choice in a decisive historical moment in the life of each person, in any case It comes from a great colonial tradition, which is subverted into a neocoloniality, which, in the same tradition, but with increasingly refined resources It has created the sensitivity of Its time, has manipulated and directed It at will, so that the dominant system survives time. A colonial aesthetic distances people from their sensitivity, and those who are far from their sensitivity are far from knowing the world and inhabiting It, they settle for superficialities and move away from the enjoyment that life itself allows.",

      "abstract": "Despite the way we think of saints as belonging to a certain historical period and confronting specific historical obstacles, we tend to see their acts as being universally meaningful, and therefore, that these acts are practices which should be imitated in some manner. However this understanding carries with it a significant difficulty: namely, there is a risk of interpreting the lives and actions of saints as providing rules of conduct to be followed, as if their enactment was an end in-itself. In other words, a simplistic notion of imitation can lead to the problem of voluntarism, where the intention to imitate an action is viewed to be sufficient or equal to actualizing goodness or piety. But there is a further, perhaps more significant problem with this understanding, and this involves how we tend to conflate the performance (or doing) of actions with their meaning. Does an action, especially that of a saint, have a meaning that is identical to its effect? Or, does the action itself produce a sense of meaning that outruns its effect? If the answer to this last question is affirmative, then the actions of a saint can be said to predicate an emergent meaning, that is, a meaning that has not yet been articulated, let alone realized. A saint would therefore be less a figure of convention and more a figure of innovation.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, I employ Paul Ricoeur’s theory of symbol to show how, beyond the historical specificity of the lives of saints, their actions can be understood to offer new ways of understanding the possibility for being, which I will unapologetically link to the Christian notion of “the New Being.” My discussion will first include a summary of Ricoeur’s theory of symbol, turning next to an application of this theory to saints and the contrasting context of the Prophet in the Hebrew Bible. The chapter will conclude with an elaboration of a symbolic understanding of action in relation to the New Being.",

      "abstract": "This book rehumanizes perpetrators of mass atrocities. At present a victim/perpetrator dichotomy appears to be the dominant paradigm: perpetrators have either been 'mechanistically dehumanized', that is, perceived as unemotional, hard-hearted and conforming and thereby lacking the core features of human nature or alternatively, they have been 'animalistically dehumanized'. In other words they are seen as immoral, unintelligent, lacking self-control and likened to animals. Within sociology and criminology the dominant view is that genocide and other mass atrocities are committed by technologically-lobotomized perpetrators. Somehow the process of rationalization is believed to have transformed these people from emotionally healthy people into hollow soulless shells of human beings or zombies, devoid of a full range of normal emotions. These people are considered bereft of any ability to reason, think or feel, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli. However it is difficult to imagine crime (especially those involving a group of people working together for the duration of a particular criminal activity) without emotions. For instance, there is ample evidence suggesting that both crimes of passion and pre-meditated crimes involve emotional arousal. Furthermore, research in fields such as evolutionary biology, psychology and sociology of work and organizations suggest that emotions are essential for human progress and survival. In addition, emotions help us make the right call in risky and uncertain situations, in other words, the majority of real life situations. There is, therefore, a need to revisit existing assumptions around the role of emotions in mass atrocities.",

Accordingly, it may seem a curious imper tinence to make this 'default' an explicit theme in an essay on religious tradition and education. It is important therefore, at the outset, to secure the theme as far as possible against misunderstanding. Default here signifies 'to be wanting', or 'to be in want of, or 'to be deprived of. Hence, what is described as 'the default of God' is a human, historical event and, as such, it means, in Heidegger's words: 'that no god any longer gathers men and things unto himself, visibly and unequivocably, and by such gather ing disposes the world's history and man's sojourn in it.' Of course a relationship with God continues to live on in our own historical epoch, in individuals, in churches, in some homes and indeed within some schools.",

We show that this pattern holds (Experiment 1), but only when creativity is socially valued (Experiment 2). Finally, especially individualistic people are more creative under MS when they can leave a legacy than when they cannot, and high originality predicts subsequent accessibility of death thoughts (Experiment 3).

With regard to people who did not (and perhaps cannot) do anything to put us in their debt, reciprocity does not tell us what to do. It does not tell us why. More generally, it says little about when or how or why to make the first move, because reciprocity primarily is about how to respond when someone else has made the first move.",

      "title": "Synchrony and sympathy: Social entrainment with music compared to a metronome.",
      "abstract": "We synchronize movements with other individuals in our everyday life (e.g., when shaking hands), in sports (e.g., rowing), or on dancefloors. Especially this last kind of social entrainment can lead to states of pleasure and ecstasy. In some situations, we even unintentionally mirror another person's gestures or movements, for example, when we are walking with another person and the phase of our steps becomes aligned with the other person's steps. Depending on the relationship we have with this person, such a situation can be awkward or pleasant. All of these examples show that movement synchronization and social bonding are tightly linked. In the current study, we examined affiliation and pro-social behavior following a synchronous or asynchronous interpersonal tapping task with music or a metronome.Interpersonal Coordination and MusicInterpersonal coordination-be it behavior matching, such as mimicry, or interactional synchrony, such as simultaneous rhythmic movements (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991)-is a fundamental way to form socioemotional connections. Behavioral mimicry describes the mirroring of another person's gestures, postures, or other movements (e.g., speech gestures, foot shaking; for a review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Factors that increase the tendency to mimic the behavior of another person include pro-social attitudes (Leighton, Bird, Orsini, & Heyes, 2010), being in a good mood (Likowski et al., 2011), and the likability (Stel et al., 2010) or the goal to get along with this person (Lakin & Chartrand, 2003). In turn, being mimicked can positively affect feelings of liking toward the mimicker (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), feelings of interpersonal closeness (Ashton-James, van Baaren, Chartrand, Decety, & Karremans, 2007), and pro-social behavior in adults (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, & van Knippenberg, 2004) and infants (Carpenter, Uebel, & Tomasello, 2013).In contrast to behavioral mimicry that usually includes a time lag of a few seconds, interactional synchrony describes movements that are temporally matched. The social entrainment model of McGrath and Kelly (1986, as cited in Clayton, Sager, & Will, 2004, p. 10) makes the assumption that many human behaviors are oscillatory or rhythmical. The model proposes that the oscillations or rhythms are created endogenously, that the endogenous oscillations or rhythms can become aligned in phase and frequency within an individual and between individuals, and that the temporal patterns of an individual or a group of individuals can become entrained to an external timekeeper. A variety of research suggests that the interpersonal synchronization of movements, such as walking, pendulum-swinging, chair-rocking, body-swaying, or finger-tapping, promotes affiliation and pro-social orientation (Demos, Chaffin, Begosh, Daniels, & Marsh, 2012; Hove & Risen, 2009; Marsh, Richardson, & Schmidt, 2009; Reddish, Fischer, & Bulbulia, 2013; Valdesolo & Desteno, 2011; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009). By using a moving visual timekeeper, Hove and Risen (2009) showed that the degree of synchrony between the participants' and the experimenters' finger-taps was positively related to how much participants liked the experimenter. Such effects may even be stronger when moving together while listening to music: When rocking in a chair with a partner, the degree of synchronization with music is positively correlated with the feeling of interpersonal connectedness (Demos et al., 2012).Listening to music has a strong emotional component and, similarly to social bonding, engages the endogenous opioid system (Tarr, Launay, & Dunbar, 2014). Related to this, Tarr, Launay, and Dunbar (2016) showed that pain thresholds increased after synchronously dancing (i.e., identical movements while listening to the same music) in groups of four. The authors link this effect to the release of endorphins. In contrast, partial synchrony (i. …",

One type of account was not found, namely an accident. In the finding, the researcher finds that every excuse contains justification but every justification does not contain an excuse. Moreover, the justification aspect is more dominantly used because the character always justifies the bad behavior of others or themselves. In excuses, the defeasibility aspect is used because many murders are committed based on victims who deserve to be killed. The scapegoating aspect is used by the character to accuse others of the mistakes he made so as not to become a suspect of his actions and the biological is the last factor that causes Account’s behavior in this movie script.",

If a live model presents an opportunity to study human anatomy or embodied gestures without the interruption of clothing, participants would likely focus upon parts which normally remain private. Instead, it is not rare to see sketches and work which could have been produced while permitting the model to wear swimwear or even substantial clothing.Nudity's status within the artist-live model relationship will be one topic of this essay. Three additional questions will be (1) the model's motivation; (2) the degree of agency attributed to the model: for some, a mere prop; for others, a full-fledged performer; (3) the role of 'art' in the live model session given how much of it remains incomplete and not displayed.",

Animal play and human ritual are areas that are not commonly considered to involve altruism but closer inspection may be warranted.

      "title": "The Union and Interaction of Mind and Body (Part 2)",
      "abstract": "Abstract The Aristotelian model of causation with which Descartes was familiar is far different from our post-Humean model of causation. APer Hume, the paradigm example of causation is one billiard ball striking another and the second billiard ball rolling away. In such a case there are two events, where the prior event is the cause of the subsequent event. For the Aristotelians, a paradigm example of causation would be a person liPIing a vase. The effect is the vase’s being liPIed, and the cause could be viewed either as the person doing the liPing or the person’s act of liPing. In such a case, it would be wrong to say that the effect is an event or process subsequent to the cause. The vase’s being liPed is not temporally subsequent to the person’s act of liPing (nor would we say it is subsequent to the person). Indeed, the stronger claim can be made that in such a case, there is really only one event or process. The person’s liPing of the vase is not a different event or process from the vase’s being liPed. This Aristotelian model of causation is characterized by the doctrine of the identity of action and passion: the agent’s action is one and the same change as the passion undergone by the patient.",

      "abstract": "When people experience the death of loved ones, some of them report after-death communications (ADCs) in which they have the impression of again encountering those loved ones by means of different types of visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and/or sentient phenomena. There is one particular type of ADC that can be referred to as a bereavement detachment experience (BDE) because the experient has the impression of being out of and/or away from their physical body during that encounter. Despite the general absence of an imminent threat or a near-death condition associated with a BDE, there are a number of similar features that are also found in reports of the NDE, such as encountering and communicating with deceased loved ones, venturing through a dark place or a tunnel, seeing or entering into a bright light, entering into transcendental otherworldly environments, and feelings of love or peace. This is an exploratory study of the BDE in which seven case examples are examined for a possible thematic pattern and then analyzed for their similarities and differences with the NDE. The aftereffects of the BDE are also explored as a beneficial psychological outcome for the experient. The findings of this study have therapeutic implications with important insights for those providing care to the bereaved.",

      "abstract": "Moonstone: The Boy Who Never Was (Mánasteinn: Drengurinn sem aldrei var til, 2013) by Sjón tells of three eventful months in the life of Máni Steinn in the fall of 1918. In this short period the volcano Katla erupts, the Spanish flu rages and Iceland regains its sovereignty from Denmark. Building on Judith Butler’s, Mary Douglas’s and Michel Foucault’s theories regarding the body as a cultural construct, this article focuses on body discourse as presented in Moonstone. According to Douglas there is a direct link between boundaries of the body and boundaries of society. Everything that endangers the stability of society’s boundaries is considered social pollution. Foucault’s theory on panopticism likewise identifies surveillance and discipline of citizens’ bodies as means of maintaining society’s social structure. Because Máni Steinn is queer, his body is considered abnormal according to the period’s definitions on what constitutes a healthy and stable body. Aberrations from the „healthy“, heterosexual body creates divergence within society's fabric. To regain the appearance of a „pure“ society Máni needs to be hidden or banished from it. Yet the arrival of the Spanish flu to Reykjavík deconstructs conventional definition of the body and unravels the social hierarchy. The distinction between the healthy and the infected is obliterated, as the body becomes a site where irreconcilable opposites merge. During the turmoil of the Spanish flu boundaries of the body become as unstable as society's boundaries become fluent.",

      "abstract": "It is quite often, wittingly or unwittingly, that people assume society, even the state, as person. They talk about society in a way as if it shares same attributes with human being: can be sick (as if it has body), can think (as if it has mind), can speak (as if it has mouth), for example. It is quite obvious that this gesture implies a view of society as an agglomeration of individuals. The problem arises around the legitimacy of this gesture: namely, to analogize the society as individuals always implies a logical leap. Things even get murkier when this gesture is applied even more to the way in which people recognize the state: as collectivities, as a &ldquo;big-person.&rdquo; This gesture, which has methodological impact, is what the author call &lsquo;anthropomorphism analogy&rsquo;. By doing what the author call psychogenealogy&mdash;a mixture of Lacanian psychoanalysis and Foucauldian genealogy, that is a way at seeing history as constituted by various contestation of materialization of desire&mdash;to the history of the modern state, namely, modern sovereign state, the author seeks to remedy this analogy with an objective account.

Unless one is a member of the upper class or the power echelons of the society, social acceptance is not possible in the absence of unspoiled honour.2 Closely connected with honour is the concept of shame: an individual usually feels ashamed when he is dishonoured in the eyes of his friends and the community at large. The Greek concept ofphildtimo clarifies the connection between honour and shame and determines whether or not any action will be taken in order to restore the damaged honour. Etymologically phildtimo means 'love of honour' and is used to identify the character of a Greek who is concerned with his honour and his good name above all and who is willing to safeguard it at any price. Phildtimo acts as the sensitizing catalyst which makes the individual feel shame when one of his own or of his",

Human trafficking is seen as a modern manifestation of slavery, the exploitation of other people’s labor and the treatment of people as property over which one has fully unlimited power and the ability to decide its fate. In human trafficking, manifested is what is the worst in man, but also what is the weakest. On the one hand, we are dealing with a man who, in his humanity, treats another human being as an object, as a thing that can be bought, sold or borrowed. On the other hand, we are dealing with a man who, in his extreme weakness, whether social – caused by external circumstances or psychological – resulting from, for example, fear, is reduced to the role of an object and as such is completely enslaved, deprived of initiative and stripped of dignity. It can be said that in this situation we are dealing with the quintessence of evil in interpersonal relationships. The article presents problems related to the issue of trafficking in human beings, in particular the recognition of potential victims of this practice. Looking on the victims of trafficking in human beings trough the criminological prism gives a wide field for the analysis of the presented problem.",

      "abstract": "The number of notions of health is not infinite. In the history of medicine we can only find a number of different conceptions or paradigmatic ideas of health, in a variety of references and combinations. Health was seen as: 1. harmonious balance between principles or entities, 2. result of a struggle against opposing forces, 3. continuous dialectical process, 4. hierarchy of components or functions, 5. potential to perform and to develop, 6. transcendence towards higher levels of being, 7. result of conscious autonomous action, 8. optimal causal functioning, or 9. public task and responsibility. Hahnemann’s view of health, as reflected in his writings, utilized virtually all of these elements. They reappear for instance as: 1. harmonious tuning of the life force, 2. defeat of pathogenetic influences, 3. admittance of aggravations, 4. autocracy of the spirit-like life principle, 5. reference to a higher goal of human existence, 6. perfecting character of medical service, 7. concern about dietetics and life style, 8. utilization of causality and natural science, and 9. appealing to governmental provisions and medical police. These paradigms have been repeatedly recombined and applied. The theory of medicine is the attempt to analyze, adjust, and develop concepts that meet the demand of contemporary medical practice. Medical theory lies between the fields of observable facts and metaphysical convictions. Distinguishing the levels of practice, theory, and metaphysics could allow the open discussion of theoretical issues, such as the concept of health or disease, without raising purely theoretical objections to well-established practice.",

Three forms of treatment particularly facilitated this threat. The first was treating detainees as something other than human, for example as an object or number. The second was isolating detainees from other humans, whether physically or through the creation of what I refer to as 'social islands.' Social islands seem to have emerged when detainees were kept apart from others who understand their culture and / or spoke their language, a practice that seems to have been as difficult for many men to endure as physical isolation. The third mechanism was sensory deprivation. The identity endangerment that resulted from these practices frequently contributed to an experience of social death. It was this experience of social death, both in Guantanamo and especially post-release, that many labeled the worst aspect of their imprisonment.",

What is the relationship between such actions and our capacities for rational agency? I take this to be a question about responsibility in a particular use of that term, which I shall call ‘responsibility 2 ’. We are not responsible 2 for all our intentional actions (actions under hypnosis, for example), but we can nevertheless be responsible 2 for actions we do not adequately control, for negligent actions, and for non‐intentional omissions. Appreciating this helps show that familiar principles of responsibility are false: those which delimit responsibility to intentional actions or to actions and outcomes under our control. In the attempt to fashion an alternative principle, cases of negligence prove pivotal. We hold ourselves and others responsible 2 for conduct within our respective ‘domains of secure competence’, (i.e. that within which we are confident of doing what we set ourselves to do, barring events which defeat our competence), even when actions within that domain fail. The significance of this practice of holding ourselves and others responsible 2 lies in the way it maintains our sense of who we are and of how we are related to the world in which we act. 1",

      "abstract": "Are we morally justified in killing fish and if so, for what purposes? We will not focus on the suffering that is done during the killing, but on the question whether death itself is harmful for fish. We need to distinguish two questions: (1) can death be considered a harm for fish; and (2) if so, how much of a harm is it? We will explore three lines of reasoning: (1) fish desire to stay alive; (2) death deprives fish of future happiness or goods; (3) something valuable is lost when fish are killed. Some argue that a being can form a desire to stay alive only when it has the capacity to be aware of itself as a distinct entity existing over time. We will cast doubt on this view: Do we value continued life because it is desirable or do we desire continued life because it is valuable? It seems more plausible that it is not the desire to live that matters, but being able to enjoy goods, and death thwarts future opportunities for enjoyment. This would entail that a being can have an interest in continued life, without actively being interested in it. Next, we will discuss the question how harmful death is for fish. A widely shared intuition is that it is worse to kill a human being or mammal than a fish, because human or mammal life is more valuable. But can we really account for this intuition?",

      "title": "Seven Modalities of Silence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Silence is analysed in seven concealed modalities: the unthinkable, the unspeakable/unsayable, the ineffable, the inarticulable, the unnoticeable, the unknowable, and the unconceptualizable. The unthinkable mainly refers to unacceptable or highly unlikely occurences. The unspeakable is considered too repulsive or outrageous to voice. It both overlaps with and differs from the unsayable inasmuch as the latter can signify something that cannot be said because there is no possibility of either saying or naming it. The ineffable often relates to sacred or divine qualities, or approached through Derrida’s notion of différance. The inarticulable can follow from a deficiency of linguistic expression or be identified in psychoanalysis as repression, blockage, or trauma. The first four modalities concern the ways in which silence intervenes in and manages human expressiveness. The sixth and seventh relate to silences at the very limits of epistemological or ontological reach. The unknowable pertains to a fundamental lack of information, while the unconceptualizable refers to the unavailability of an intellectual and cultural apparatus through which certain kinds of knowledge can be processed. The fifth—the unnoticeable—is an outlier both to the first four and to the last two. It shares with the former the presence of epistemological constraints on conveying knowledge. It shares with the latter the presence of circumstances that sever the accessibility of human agency to evidence or knowledge. They are reflected in Bourdieu’s phrase ‘it goes without saying because it comes without saying’.",

      "abstract": "A new perspective is now duly required, in attempting to understand the history of the Goryeo people in the 13th and 14th centuries. The time should be reviewed from an entirely new angle. Such perspective should be able to evaluate the lives of the Goryeo people, based upon not only the results of their actions, but also the ideas and intentions that were behind their acts. And at the same time such perspective should also be able to interpret the nature of existence and pattern of thinking that belonged to all those people, based upon the Goryeo people's own mentality and not ours. With such new perspective, we shall be able to examine the lives of the Goryeo people just exactly as they actually were, instead of concocting a derivative image from nowhere regarding their existence. They were just living, breathing people who adjusted to the situations as they saw fit, and we should not judge them for what they did not do or plan. Previous misunderstandings, like believing that the people would have exclusively maintained either a 'pro-Yuan' attitude or 'anti-Yuan' stance all the time, or they would have exclusively pursued either 'restoration of the past' or 'embracing foreign institutions' for the duration of their coexistence with the Mongols, should not be repeated in future studies. The people had both attitudes inside them, and the governments pursued both agendas at the same time.",

      "abstract": "After the death of a closely related person or of a friend, after the death of a beloved animal, but also after the loss of an important personal object, mourning is a normal and an important process. The mourner and the deceased person become a single social unit where specific burial rites are practiced. so that the dead, with the help of the living, can enter the land of the ancestors. Sometimes, however, the person in mourning develops psychiatric symptoms and needs help for this process. The process has become an adjustment disorder or even has caused the outbreak of another psychiatric disorder. Specific prolonged mourning can also take place when the deceased embodies a homeland or specific aspects of the self that has been lost to the mourner either through war or other traumatic identity displacements. Likewise, when a person's body is missing, but presumed dead, he/she cannot be buried and commemorated in a way that allows the mourner to find comfort and hope that the important traits and identity of the deceased will live on as an ancestor to give continuity, strength and advice to the living. This chapter focuses on how to handle a psychopathological mourning process and how this handling depends on psychiatric diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "The making of, any mark upon any surface by direct human agency, as a means of communicating information to a fellow-man, is (in a broad sense) handwriting; this may include engrossing and drawing, and even painting. Nevertheless, in its popular acceptation, the term is limited to that form of freely written characters usually adopted by one person in sending messages to another person. In its restricted sense, therefore, handwriting may be considered as the written speech of the individual; like his oral efforts-and, indeed, like his every act-it soon becomes impressed with characteristics peculiar to himself, and tending to differentiate him from all other individuals. This establishes for him a customary and distinctive style, in writing, which may be more or less varied, from time to time, by accidental causes, such as haste, carelessness, position in writing, excitement, weakness, or disease. A writer's style gradually becomes so much a part of his nature that the physical act of writing is then scarcely a conscious effort on his part, but is rather an automatic production, resulting from his mere mental determination to write. This almost unconscious production includes (inter alia) two distinct parts, viz.: the physical method of performing the act, and the pictorial forms resulting from such performance; of these two divisions, ordinarily but few of the details of the first are (or can be) known to the person using them, and many of the details of the second are also unknown to him.",

Environmental violence can occur through a variety of legal or illegal means and it can involve violent acts against humans and nonhumans, such as poisoning, battery, suffocation, burning alive, starvation, and false imprisonment. Although the leniency around proving guilt for prohibita cases may appear desirable, given that is easier to obtain a guilty verdict from the court, we do not believe this should be the case for environmental violence. The level of violence against nonhuman animals through environmental degradation is immense and can best be illustrated through the concept of the Anthropocene. Politics, unsurprisingly, cannot be left out of the mix of environmental violence and violence against all beings in that environment.",

      "abstract": "Human involuntarily experience certain physical items, products of human actions, and human actions themselves, as having meaning-properties: for example, as possessing meaning, as referring, or as having truth values. For example, a sign on a door \"Drinks Inside,\" involuntarily strikes native speakers of English as referring to liquids in the room behind the door. The sign has a truth value—if no drinks are found in the room, the sign is misleading. Someone's pointing in a direction has the same effect: we experience her gesture as significant. The suggestion isn't that, during conversations, we don't recognize the expectations or intentions of speakers (or those of our own). We recognize that the person pointing in a certain direction intends us to understand her gesture's significance. Nevertheless, we experience that gesture as having significance independently of her intentions. The gesture is meaningful all on its own. So too with language, written sentences: We experience the meaning-properties—the meanings—of language artifacts as independent of the intentions of their makers in exactly the same way that we experience the shape of an object as a property of it that's independent of the color it has. There is a distinctive phenomenology to the experience of understanding language (a distinctive character to the experience we have when in the presence of language). This book explores this experience of language in great depth, and shows how the resulting phenomenology can be brought to bear as evidence for and against competing theories of language—for example, the very popular Gricean approaches to language.",

      "title": "Sticks and Stones Can Break Your Bones But Names Can Really Hurt You: Justifying the Use of Force as a Defense Against 'Mere Words'",
      "abstract": "Words hurt! Beginning in the 1950's, courts have recognized that words, by their very utterance, can inflict injury and harm. The law redresses those who suffer injury from harmful speech through a series of seemingly innocuous remedies including financial remuneration or retribution through minimal criminal penalties. The law stops, however, at granting individuals the right to use any type of force to prevent against the use of harmful words. In other words, legislatures and courts have been unwilling to elevate an actor's use of harmful words, or a victim's defense against them, to the same jurisprudential echelon as they do the use of physical force. But new scientific studies confirm that a word or some types of emotional harm can inflict as much pain as a punch. Biological and neurochemical studies are rapidly advancing our understanding of human behavior. New knowledge supports the conclusion that one can experience physical pain in response to a tone or particular words. The law's failure to excuse those defending against harmful words is unjustified in light of these recent neuroscience findings. This paper will propose that the criminal law should extend the self-defense doctrine to permit one to protect him or her self from an imminent threat of bodily harm even if that bodily harm is inflicted through verbal or psychic abuse.",

AMG publisher, 1994: 2-3G.). Then in the process of creating humans for maintain the universe, but man falls into sin so that his mind or intellect is dominated by sin. What is produced by the mind ruled by sin? The Scriptures state the following: first, the human character is in vain (Romans 1:21). Second, it is not fair for anyone to be wise (Romans 3.11). Third, the human mind becomes evil (Ephesians 5: 4, the human mind is hostile to God and results in evil deeds 1.21) In further development, the universe is not getting better, it's actually getting more and more damaged. Natural disasters occur everywhere, economic conditions are chaotic, laws are violated by the leaders themselves, society is socially hostile to each other, crime is everywhere. With the chaotic event, humans crave a real change and share of activities carried out to realize these desires, among others, with the current plasticity, the transformation movement. The author conducted this research and the results are expected to provide information and additional insight for parties related to the problem of understanding the doctrine of existence and the meaning of sin, thus understanding the meaning of transformation based on the Bible to be changed to not sin anymore. The expected benefit is to provide correct knowledge to the congregation and God's servants regarding the effects of sin in their lives. Especially in service, how they anticipate sin and experience transformation changes in their lives. Thus it can remind every believer to remain faithful and abstain from every action that brings sin",

      "title": "Personal Reactive Attitudes and Partial Responses to Others",
      "abstract": "This paper argues for a new understanding of Strawson’s distinction between personal, impersonal, and self-reactive attitudes. Many Strawsonians take these basic reactive attitude types to be distinguished by two factors. Is it the self or another who is treated with good- or ill-will? And is it the self or another who displays good- or ill-will? On this picture, when someone else wrongs me, my reactive attitude is personal; when someone else wrongs someone else, my reactive attitude is impersonal; and when I wrong someone else, my attitude is self-reactive. Against this account, I argue that the basic reactive attitude types are better distinguished according to whether they express partial or impartial concern. This fits Strawson’s discussion in “Freedom and Resentment”, and it allows us to see an important point that the alternative approach obscures. Namely, while attitudes like resentment, gratitude, shame, and pride can arise as responses to our own treatment and behavior, they can also arise as third-party responses to the treatment and behavior of our family members, romantic partners, and close friends. Similarly, attitudes like moral indignation and disapprobation also have a wider scope than is often acknowledged; they can arise as responses to others’ treatment, but they can also arise as responses to our own treatment when we react impartially to circumstances involving ourselves.",

      "abstract": "A sieidi is an offering site of the Sámi that usually consisted of a wooden object or a stone unmodified by human hand. Because of their natural form they are hard to recognize in the landscape. Usually just one indicator might not be enough to distinguish a sieidi from just another stone. Written sources and oral tradition have preserved memories of the use of sieidi, but not all sieidi sites are still remembered. Sometimes just a place-name has survived. Bones or meat were a common form of offering at a sieidi, and there were rules re- stricting the handling of the bones. Some sources mention that offered bones were not to be broken. Nevertheless, there have been differences in these prac- tices. Also, other finds, including coins, metal objects, and glass, can be recov- ered at various sites. Phosphate analysis is one way to recognize a sieidi when no visual signs of the offerings are left. One or more indicators may survive, telling us about the use of a sieidi.",

In all parts of Busoga worship of the dead forms a most important part of the religion of the people, and the belief in ghosts and the propitiation of them are the chief features of their most constant and regular acts of worship. The gods, with fetishes and amulets, are able to do great things for the living; but, after all, it is the ghost that is most feared and obtains the most marked attention In childbirth, in sickness, in prosperity, and in death, ghosts materially help or hinder matters; hence it behoves the living to keep on good terms with them. It is because of this belief that people frequently make sacrifices of fowls and other animals to the dead and constantly seek their help. First and foremost, it is because of the firm conviction of the presence of ghosts that the elaborate funeral ceremonies are performed which have been noted above. In the beliefs of these primitive people we must relegate gods to a secondary place after the worship of the dead. It will be noticed that no god is believed to influence the future life of man nor do they think of ghosts as dwelling with the gods.",

This separates the inner functioning of entities like banks, aircraft, or people from their external behavior in interacting with other entities. The separation is realized by partitioning the state of a system of entities into chunks associated with objects so that each chunk is responsible for its own protection against access by unauthorized operations.

      "title": "Moral Traces and Relational Autonomy",
      "abstract": "One feature of James Childress's approach to ethics is the experience of \"moral traces\" that agents ought to feel in situations of conflict after they have overridden one strong value for the sake of another.1 This experience grasps at something intuitive about the moral life, that in situations of intense moral conflict when we are faced with a choice to act in a way that goes against a deeply held value, it is morally important that we feel and respond a certain way. At the most immediate level, this might entail privately mourning or grieving that we had to violate the value. Doing so would affirm that we care about the overridden value, and by acknowledging such a care we would feel that our moral integrity has been protected. But shouldn't the concept of moral traces entail more than a private process of grief? Shouldn't it have an effect on our relations with others? Moral traces ought to obligate us to act toward others in certain ways, and in that sense it is a concept quite distinct from the pangs of conscience we feel when we have behaved badly. At the very least, these traces ought to press us to offer an explanation or justification to others for why we acted against an important moral value, especially if those others were affected negatively by our action. In more extreme cases, we might even be compelled to make amends or offer reparations to the one or ones who were harmed by our action.2In this article I am interested in sorting through the ways that moral traces function in the moral life, especially in terms of the work they do in maintaining and building social and institutional relationships. I want to suggest that moral traces are more than an internal attitude that pertains to individual flourishing; they are also integral to communal well-being. By pointing to a contrast between moral traces as important for individual flourishing and moral traces as conducive to increased communal well-being, I also hope to expand our thinking about the liberal principle of autonomy that is central to Childress's approach. I am motivated in this article by a worry that some might use the appeal to moral traces to reinforce an individualistic, psychological notion of the self. This is clearly something that Childress does not do, as can be seen in his 1970 Soundings article, \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?\" There he tethers the equitable distribution of scarce medical resources firmly to the maintenance of relationships of trust. In later writings, he explicitly outlines the obligations to others that emerge in situations when an important value has been overridden. Relationships of trust and the obligations to others incurred by moral traces both point to a conception of agency that is relational.In what follows, I hope to suggest the broad contours of an account of moral traces that highlights its relational features. Looking at moral traces through a relational lens accentuates, and perhaps even intensifies, the obligations that they incur. Put differently, relational conceptions of autonomy require a more careful account of moral traces—one that focuses on what we owe one another. By a relational conception of autonomy, I mean a view of agency that sees the choices we make as shaped by our relations with and commitment to others. Highlighting moral traces as central to the moral life is a way to recognize the importance of human accountability, which ensures that we are always fully aware of how our actions affect others. Ultimately, the significance of the effect of moral traces does not lie simply in protecting an agent's integrity or sense of herself as morally whole but rather in how it promotes the building and maintaining of relations.Annette Baier makes this point eloquently in her critique of Michael Stocker's account of moral guilt—a concept that, while not exactly synonymous with moral traces, does share a family resemblance. She notes that although Stocker is concerned about the effects of moral dilemmas, his \"attention is given to the emotions of choosers, not to the feelings of the victims or beneficiaries of their choices\" (1992, 363). At another point, Baier refers to the \"dirty hands\" metaphor as pushing us \"into a Lady Macbeth frame of mind, obsessed with our own stained character rather than what we have done to others and how that felt for them\" (363).3 It is precisely this sense of how those harmed by our actions might feel that makes moral traces such a central component of a relational account of morality. Baier writes, \"Without a moral psychology that puts informed empathy and willingness to listen to others' point of view squarely in the center of our moral-psychological capacities, without a social interactive account both of rationality and of morality, the constraints that moral psychology can put on what counts as 'a more acceptable version of ethics' will be merely formal and very limited\" (365).While Childress does not use the term moral traces in his early Soundings article, he does offer some brief thoughts that hint at its further development in later writings. His short mention of moral guilt in this article serves as an impetus for my reflections about how moral traces can serve a relationship-building or maintaining purpose. I begin by assessing what he says in the Soundings article, especially as it relates to the view of the theologian Helmut Thielicke, whom Childress discusses in this article. I then look to Childress's discussion of moral traces in later writings on war, bioethics, and public health. Finally, as a way to further examine the relational implications of the concept, I turn to two fairly recent concepts in the bioethics literature: moral distress in nursing ethics and \"the patient as victim and vector model\" in public health ethics. While certainly not identical to Childress's conception of moral traces, these concepts reinforce a similar sentiment about relationality and our obligations to others in difficult moral cases. They also help us see that moral traces are not only located in the individual conscience or in the moral universe more generally; their effects are also embodied in institutional procedures.4 This echoes Childress's sentiment in the 1970 Soundings article that one of the tasks of social ethics is \"to propose relatively just institutional arrangements within which self-interested and biased men can live\" (Childress 1970, 342).In the 1970 article \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?,\" James Childress makes a passing reference to a concept that forms a connective tissue through the corpus of his work in areas as diverse as conscience, war, and bioethics. He suggests that the allocation of scarce lifesaving medical resources (SLMR) presents us with \"'borderline situations' which inevitably involve guilt\" (1970, 175). He borrows the phrase \"borderline situations\" from the German theologian Helmut Thielicke, who had only recently addressed the issue of allocation of scarce lifesaving resources at a symposium held in Texas. It is not fully clear in his brief discussion of Thielicke whether or not Childress believes that decisions about allocating scarce medical resources must involve guilt.5 He writes, \"Even if all actions in SLMR should involve guilt, some may preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others\" (347). What is clear, however, is that he distances himself from Thielicke's view that the best humans can do in the face of these borderline situations is \"to understand and endure—not 'solve'\" them. By contrast, Childress believes that one can make discriminating judgments using the tools of ethics so that even our choices about \"who shall live when not all can live\" are informed by the notion that some decisions may \"preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others.\" For him the preservation of human dignity is achieved through a careful evaluation of the factors and norms in a given situation. Thus, whereas for Thielicke, any ethical judgment in such situations is flawed, Childress holds more optimistically that reasoned ethical judgments are possible. For both of them, however, the agent's realization that she is affected in some way by such difficult moral choices is important to her human flourishing. What is unclear in this brief reference is the nature and extent of this effect on the moral agent. Does it morally obligate her to make some sort of amends, or does it simply do its work on a psychological level in terms of ensuring that the overridden principle does not lose its potency?Thielicke's ideas about moral guilt are both deeply existential and deeply theological. For Thielicke, the guilt that results from moral dilemmas is debilitating to the point that it leaves the Christian moral agent with very few viable options. Indeed, he does not see the task of evangelical theological ethics as providing easy answers or solutions to ethical problems.6 Roman Catholic casuistry and its legalistic and naturalistic theology falls prey to this temptation. He uses the term \"borderline situations\" (Grenzsituation) to depict what he calls \"abnormal cases,\" ones that involve \"transitions or complications\" (Thielicke 1966, 578).7 The prime example of such a situation for Christians, according to Thielicke, is when they must use the methods of their evil opponent, as in the case of the duty to fight oppressive tyrannical dictatorships. Thus the individual Christian, especially if he holds political responsibility, is \"ineluctably forced into a situation in which he must act within a framework of injustice\" (585). What such situations teach Christians is that the world is fallen: \"man has perverted his world, and no man is exempt from sharing responsibility for this human character of his world, this demonic humanizing of the world. No man is merely the object of a conflict situation. We are all part of the human subject that helped to bring it about\" (597). Thus what is communal about this guilt for Thielicke is that the difficult moral conflict serves to remind Christians of their ongoing guilt as children of Adam. The borderline situation has its \"origin in a communal guilt which already stands behind our situation and which we for our part ever increase and intensify…. We are both channels and perpetrators of cosmic guilt\" (602).Borderline questions, according to Thielicke, \"preclude the possibility of any final answers.\" He writes, \"The questions must remain open\" (1970, 147). The impossibility of any final answers to difficult moral dilemmas is firmly grounded in certain theological presuppositions, such as human sinfulness. Thielicke understands the human condition of sin as a usurpation of man's limits—a going beyond the limits to which humans are destined. Put differently, it is that man \"has placed himself in sinful contradiction to the destiny for which he was created\" (154). In essence, human creativity—the ability to transform nature into culture—is always tainted by humanity's inability to accept its destiny as God's creatures. Humans are always pressing the boundaries of their creatureliness. He contrasts the Christian view that identifies suffering with human guilt and responsibility to secular ideas that attribute life's tragedy to the structures of the world. He writes, \"In myth … this world which is no longer whole tends to be regarded as something given, an intact structure in which guilt and fate are inseparably interwoven. The Bible, on the contrary, looks instead at man. It sees not the structure, but this personal representative of our disjointed world\" (156).Human sinfulness is not manifested in particular actions. Rather it is the very structure of human existence that is the root of human guilt. In essence, for Thielicke, there is no possible choice that a human can make in the face of any moral decision that would relieve her of this existential guilt: \"It is a matter of being, not action\" (164). Yet there are certain types of situations in which human decisions and human actions can bring about greater guilt. Indeed it is the experience of guilt that is a measure of the person's moral health and well-being. Like a wound that cannot be allowed to heal, the guilt one feels when making difficult moral decisions such as allocating scarce medical resources is difficult. In contrast to the utilitarian who is able to make a decision with clear-cut objective criteria, the moral person must suffer the anguish of the \"impossibility of the task.\" Her suffering is felt in \"pangs of conscience\" that are \"a kind of gauze placed in the wound to prevent its healing in the wrong way.\" Continuing with the metaphor, he insists that while the wound must not be closed, it must not be allowed to infect the moral actor: \"The pus of the insoluble dilemma must have some way of escaping. Otherwise, the very humanity of the physician himself becomes infected; he succumbs to the illusion of the easy solution\" (173). Only by keeping the wound open does Thielicke believe that humans can arrive at an awareness of the very essence of what it is to be human.The most obvious contrast between Thielicke and Childress in the Soundings article is that Childress's view of human guilt is not explicitly connected to theological and existential ideas about the ongoing guilt of humans before God. Thielicke's view of cosmic guilt undermines his confidence that any method of deciding how to allocate scarce lifesaving devices can ever really be justifiable. He invokes casting lots, but unlike Childress, his endorsement of it is lukewarm at best. He sees it as an unsatisfactory option but perhaps the best one humans have available to them in such a situation.There are two points from the Soundings article that are relevant to my attempt to rethink the concept of moral traces. First, while Childress's view about guilt in \"borderline situations\" is not explicitly developed in the article, his engagement with Thielicke is illuminating because I believe it foreshadows his later emphasis on moral traces. Thielicke's insistence that the \"wound\" should not infect the actor supports my contention that moral traces ought to do more than simply affect the individual; they must incur some sense of obligation to others. Second, Childress bases his strong support of random selection on the belief that it is the best option for maintaining human dignity, equality, and trust. All three of these values are, in his view, important for building and maintaining relationships. Childress is explicit about this in several places in the article. Quoting Paul Ramsey, he describes equality of opportunity \"as the ethical substance of the relations of those individuals to one another\"(Childress 1970, 348). In another passage, he describes trust as \"an attitude of expectation about another,\" namely, the expectation that one will be treated with respect (349).When we turn to Childress's 1978 article on just war in Theological Studies, we begin to see the full development of the concept of moral traces. In this more extended discussion, he situates them within \"the logic of prima-facie duties.\" Relying on the moral philosopher W. D. Ross, he argues that prima facie obligations are more binding than relative principles that function like rules of thumb, and less binding than absolute principles that can never be overridden. Thus, a prima facie obligation is \"intrinsically binding, but it does not necessarily determine one's actual obligation\" (1978, 430). A central component of the logic of these conflicting obligations is that \"an overridden or outweighed prima-facie obligation continues to function in the situation and the course of action one adopts\" (431; emphasis mine). Childress explicitly uses the phrases \"moral traces\" and \"residual effects\" in this article to describe how the outweighed obligation \"continues to function.\"He also turns to A. C. Ewing, who specifies more clearly how the overridden obligation continues to have a hold on the moral agent. For Ewing this hold results in a \"mental attitude\" that evokes regret, but even more important, that ought to affect the agent's future actions. Ewing writes, \"My omission to fulfill my prima facie duty to him in this case will increase the force of any prima facie obligations I may have to him as regards future actions. And even if it did not affect overt action, the existence of a prima facie obligation not to do it should always affect our mental attitude towards an action.\" Ewing describes the mental attitude as \"a positive thing even if not translated into action\" and writes further that \"a good man will at least regret the violation of prima facie duties\" (1959, 110). In a footnote, Childress comments that for W. D. Ross, the appropriate response to an overridden obligation is not shame or repentance but rather compunction.Childress's views about the intensity of this mental attitude after a moral conflict are not fully developed in this discussion. Yet he manages to introduce a broad array of terms to describe it: residual effects, regret, shame, repentance, compunction. He seems to favor the terms—traces and residue—that suggest a less intense effect on the moral agent. Elsewhere in the article, he claims more directly that guilt is not the appropriate emotional attitude in such cases. He supports, without fully developing, a notion of \"creative regret\" that he borrows from Albert R. Di Ianni (Childress 1978, 433). However, in discussing the jus ad bellum criterion of \"right intention\" as the maintenance of proper motives, he states \"an attitude of regret, if not remorse, is appropriate when a prima-facie obligation is overridden\" (438). Such a clear statement equating moral traces with regret is not typical of his discussions in later work, such as Principles of Bioethics (PBE).Nevertheless, in his view, overriding a principle does lead to specific obligations. These are most explicit in his discussion of the jus in bello criteria—the criteria that govern how to conduct war. His primary point is that even though a just war requires one to overrule the prima facie obligation not to injure or kill another, the hold that the obligation has on the moral agent is not \"overruled.\" In other words, the agent still must discharge some obligations to the other—and these obligations require that (1) the immediate object of war is not to kill or even injure, (2) one ought not directly target noncombatants, (3) one cannot impose \"unnecessary suffering,\" and (4) any effect (even if only indirect) of war on civilians \"must be justified by the principle of proportion\" (441). By connecting moral traces to the jus in bello criteria, Childress reinforces a notion that these traces are more than just an internal wound or disposition, and instead constitute an attitude that necessarily entails an obligation to minimize the harms caused by overriding a prima facie duty.When we turn our attention to Childress's later work, especially in PBE, we see that moral traces play a significant role in two ways: to remind the agent that prima facie duties are not neutral values and to highlight the centrality of conscience and integrity as virtues in the practice of medicine. The account of the logic of prima facie duties in PBE follows quite closely the account presented in the earlier just-war article. For example, Childress and his coauthor, Tom Beauchamp, argue that when overriding a prima facie obligation, there will always be traces of \"regret and a sense of moral residue.\" They write, \"Moral residue results because an overridden prima facie obligation does not simply go away when overridden\" (Beauchamp and Childress 2009, 19). While overlapping in some ways with their discussion of conscience, the two concepts remain distinct. Childress describes conscience as \"an internal sanction that comes into play through critical reflection.\" While this sanction may have different forms, he notes that it \"often appears as a bad conscience—in the form of feelings of remorse, guilt, shame, disunity, or disharmony—as the individual recognizes his or her acts as wrong\" (44). The sanction of a bad conscience is different from the feeling of moral traces, because with the former, the agent feels that the act she performed is wrong. Moral traces, by contrast, imply that one has \"residual obligations\" or that one needs to at least acknowledge internally that an important obligation or value has been sacrificed, but not that the act itself is wrong. Nevertheless, moral traces share with the conscience the ability to help repair any disunity or disharmony that the agent may have experienced in the context of the difficult dilemma.One final example of the role of moral traces in Childress's work comes from his writings on the moral foundations of public health. Along with several colleagues, he has suggested that public health officials must satisfy five justificatory conditions when choosing to override individual liberty or justice. These are effectiveness, proportionality, necessity, least infringement, and public justification. It is the last of these that I think illustrates most clearly the connection between moral traces and obligations. In particular, the public health setting provides an example of institutional obligations that result from acknowledging that an important value has been overridden. The responsibility that public officials have in this regard is \"to explain and justify that infringement, whenever possible, to the relevant parties, including those affected by the infringement.\" They must offer moral reasons because they are required to \"treat citizens as equals\" (Childress et al. 2002, 173). This activity of accountability to the public is, in Childress's words, \"indispensable for engendering and sustaining public trust, as well as for expressing justice.\" It involves actively seeking ways to engage the public with the decisions being made on its behalf. This engagement involves seeking out the public's input, maintaining transparency about the process, and providing relevant information to the public. Although Childress and his coauthors do not use the language of moral traces in this discussion of public justification, their appeal to the obligations that public authorities have when they have infringed upon or overridden important moral values is a by-product of the traces. Childress's emphasis on ongoing obligations illustrates his belief that difficult moral decisions do not come to an abrupt end; they do not disappear. Rather, responsible moral agents ought to continue to act and feel in ways that acknowledge the ongoing implications of these decisions.What can we conclude about Childress's view of moral traces from this quick summary of his work? First, it seems clear that he does not see moral traces as identical to moral regret. Individuals can experience moral traces while being sure that they made the right decision in difficult moral situation. In other words, they are not wishing that they had done something else.8 Rather, they are taking the implications of what they did seriously. Second, his view of moral traces as incurring ongoing obligations supports an account of agency that is relational. This conclusion runs counter to prevailing critiques of Childress's \"principlism\" that depict it as grounded in a conception of the agent as an isolated, atomistic individual.Accounts of personhood as relational have become fairly commonplace in normative ethical discussions, especially ones that are informed by feminist, virtue, narrative, or communitarian visions. The \"relational self\" is usually posited over against the individualistic moral agent believed to be prevalent in certain liberal philosophical approaches. This individualistic vision of autonomy is also commonly associated with bioethics discourse, especially with Childress's approach.9 Critics of autonomy worry about the tendency to see the self as independent and separate from the discursive contexts that shape our commitments and values. They think a more accurate description of moral agency is one of responsiveness to the particularities of situations and to the network of dependencies that enable individuals to flourish. While the emphasis on particularity and dependency has been appealing to many feminist theorists, some have rejected a wholesale abandonment of autonomy as potentially antithetical to feminist political goals. They are skeptical of views that mistakenly stereotype individual autonomy as fundamentally individualistic and rationalistic. Thus they want to salvage autonomy because of the central role they believe it plays in feminist analyses of oppression, subjection, and agency. The model of relational autonomy has emerged as a useful hybrid that takes the concerns raised by critics of autonomy seriously without abandoning the important function of respect for the dignity of the individual.10The principle of autonomy is clearly central to Childress's ethics. Even in the Soundings article, we can see that he supports random selection for the allocation of scarce medical resources because it preserves respect for dignity and autonomy. Yet it is important to note that for Childress this respect for autonomy does not preclude attention to relationships. Indeed, it is intimately tied to the attitudes of trust necessary for society to function. Trust provides us with one example of a deeply relational concept that is intimately tied to respect for autonomy, insofar as it reflects our ultimate respect for the other's dignity and humanity. Childress's emphasis on moral traces and the obligations they produce also supports a concept of autonomy that is attentive to human relationships. While Childress avoids pressing moral traces and regret into the stronger realms of remorse or guilt, his emphasis on residual obligations in the contexts of war, bioethics, and public health suggests that the effects of moral traces extend beyond individual conscience. They require the moral agent to attend to the impact of her act on human relationships, both private and public. This suggests that for Childress, no moral decision exists in an isolated vacuum. We cannot thus speak of individual autonomy apart from the broader social contexts that all humans inhabit. As Courtney Campbell reminds us, certain elements of Childress's theology—namely, his claims about humans created in God's image—provide the basis for a view of autonomy that goes against certain secular notions of autonomy that privilege individualism and self-determination. Childress's theologically informed view of autonomy, according to Campbell, \"must be qualified by considerations of dependence, sociality, and finitude\" (Campbell 1989).Moral traces result when one voluntarily makes a choice to act in a certain way, but recognizes that in one's doing so, an important moral principle or value is threatened or even sacrificed. But what about cases in which the choice to act is not completely voluntary, when the agent is constrained by institutional pressures? These cases are captured by the terms moral distress and moral residue—terms that have come to be associated primarily with nursing ethics. The discussion of these terms is not always very precise in the literature, where we often see the terms conflated. It is useful, however, to get a sense of how these concepts work and to ask whether they offer any useful insights for thinking about the relational component of moral traces.The appeal to the language of moral distress and moral residue in nursing ethics refers to a much more intense sentiment than Childress's appeal to moral traces. Indeed, at times it sounds like a radically different phenomenon—something that results from forced violations of moral values, rather than from genuinely dilemmatic situations. In that sense, it is more like situations that involve violations of conscience and integrity. Recall that in PBE, Beauchamp and Childress distinguish moral traces from conscience. Nevertheless, discussions of moral distress can show us how internal reflections about our moral choices can and should have an effect on our obligations to others. More particularly, they draw attention to the implications of moral traces on institutional structures and procedures.Jameton's pioneering article on the issue of moral distress in nursing makes an important distinction between moral dilemmas (which Childress believes gives rise to moral traces) and moral distress. Moral dilemmas occur when \"it is clear to the nurse that different and important values conflict, but no choice presents itself that preserves both\" (Jameton 1993, 542). In contrast, distress is what occurs when a moral agent is unable to act on a judgment as a result of institutional or professional constraints. For Jameton, moral dilemmas present interesting material for students of philosophy to ponder, but in reality, they are rare and, in his words, \"are bad news and to be avoided\" (543). By dismissing moral dilemmas as rare occurrences, Jameton pays little attention to the experiences of moral regret or guilt. He worries, however, that nurses often conflate or confuse dilemmas (in the philosophical sense) with the experience of moral distress. In other words, when asked to describe their experiences, nurses often characterize the distress they feel at not being able to act on their judgments as dilemmatic. Although he acknowledges that distress can and often does give rise to \"second-order\" moral dilemmas, it is a mistake to view situations when one's choices are constrained institutionally as dilemmatic. To do so leads nurses to unnecessarily blame themselves for situations over which they have little control. I think Jameton's point is pertinent because I take him to be saying that when nurses view their actions as resulting from genuine dilemmas instead of from unjust institutional structures, they will experience the wrong kind of guilt. What really matters for nurses is that institutions treat them justly by allowing them opportunities to participate fully in the decision-making process. Jameton is worried about the conflation of dilemmatic situations and situations of moral distress because of its implications for moral responsibility. The importance of the category of \"moral distress\" is that it draws attention to how nurses are often forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held beliefs and commitments. This violation leads to a significant moral crisis that can potentially paralyze the agent. In other words, unlike moral traces, moral distress does little for relationship and community building. Indeed, it leads to disintegration. The \"distressed\" nurse is isolated and finds herself alienated from her institutional and professional role. In the end, while the literature on moral distress often seems to be referring to something different from moral traces in the sense that Childress uses the term, it can offer us some useful insight about relationship/community building in the aftermath of difficult moral problems. In particular, it helps us to think about how moral traces in Childress's sense ought to lead to just social and institutional arrangements.Margaret Battin's recent contribution to public health ethics offers us more resources for thinking about moral traces and their relational features. She intends her work as an intervention in bioethics and public health ethics—one that attempts to undermine the notion of the self that underlies these approaches. Her approach is animated by several concerns. One has to do with a failure of bioethics to account for infectious disease as a defining feature of human experience. For Battin, this seemingly minor oversight overlooks something very important about our nature as human animals. She writes, \"Infectiousness is an especially direct reminder of how misleading the paradigms of individualism can be\" (Battin et al. 2009, 78). Battin's overarching goal, however, is to develop a more sensitive account of public health ethics. While she does not explicitly address the ideas of regret, remorse, or conscience, I believe her reminder about our biological reality as deeply interconnected creatures serves as a useful impetus for thinking about the implications of relational autonomy.Battin describes the self as a \"way-station,\" and \"embedded\" self, a vision of subjectivity that resonates with many feminist critiques of autonomy.11 Battin's important insight is that to speak of persons as shaped and constituted by and through their webs of relations is to speak about something physical and biological. She visualizes, rather than a romantic vision of relationality as constituted merely by friendship and familial relations, the individual as a \"launching pad and breeding ground for trillions of organisms that move from one human being to another, either directly or by way of intermediate vectors\" (462). This biological view expands the feminist account of relational autonomy. She writes, \"Attention to social locatedness is not enough. Physical locatedness … is critical as well\" (78).While clinical medicine has tended to see the patient primarily as a victim, public health has seen the patient primarily as a vector. Battin urges public health and bioethics to view patients as both simultaneously, \"an account in which the patient can be seen as both victim and vector at the same time, a person simultaneously occupying both morally relevant roles\" (87). Another way to put this is that we need to think of ourselves not only in terms of the threats to us but also in terms of the threats we potentially pose to others. This, according to Battin, draws a more nuanced and complex picture of moral agency. In particular it complicates notions of responsibility and blame that posit that we can always know who is to blame and for what. The biological view of ourselves as victims and vectors of infectious disease acknowledges that we cannot always know with certainty who is to blame (who harms and who is harmed).This view of the self provides an interesting grounding to the notion of moral traces as a relational concept. Agents in a dilemmatic situation are never fully relieved of the traces of guilt or sorrow for what they have done, and that is a good thing. It serves as a reminder of our shared vulnerability and woundedness as human subjects. In other words, our actions have effects and the virtuous agent is sensitive to these effects. In the image of Battin's way-station self we see how we are all biologically connected in pathways of disease. In a similar way moral traces remind us of our roles as both subjects and objects.We can see the implications of Battin's metaphysical view in her treatment of the ethics of distribution of scarce medical resources in cases of pandemic emergencies. She concurs with the pandemic triage plans put forth by Canada, Tennessee, and Utah that all base their allocation decisions on \"medical criteria of survivability and need\" (397). However, she notes that the patient as victim and vector (PVV) perspective draws our attention to two additional points. First, these plans fail to give an adequate account of what kind of care those who are \"deprioritized\" receive, and second, existing injustices in health care are exacerbated by these allocation criteria. Consequently, Battin argues that the plans must be clear about the obligation they have to care for those who will not be first in the queue to receive care in such an emergency. The issue of injustice only makes clear that we have an obligation to attend to health care inequities before such emergency situations strike. These conclusions illustrate the importance of the residual obligations incurred in situations of moral conflict. Like Childress's views about the necessity of the jus in bello criteria, and about the importance of public justifications in public health, Battin affirms that overriding a principle leaves traces that are not only wounding to the moral agent but also damaging to the relationships of trust that enable communities to exist and flourish.Without a strong sense of moral traces or even moral regret, we are left with a view of an agent who is not fully accountable to others—who can override important moral norms without having to incur any costs. Moral traces acknowledge the vulnerability and limits of our humanity. Yet it would be a mistake to stop there by allowing such an acknowledgment to turn us inward by focusing exclusively on whether our integrity has been damaged. Moral traces ought to do more than just make us feel bad. They are the impetus for broadcasting our accountability to others by offering reasons for our actions. In the case of the allocation of scarce medical resources, that accountability is necessary for extending and maintaining trust between health care providers and patients. Childress argues that randomness and chance are \"most in accord with this relationship of trust\" (1970, 349). Decisions about who should receive lifesaving treatments based on social worth are not attentive to the long-term effects of our actions on the fundamental relationships that form the basis of our society.",

Therefore, as a human being, you must be careful not to harm yourself or others. Even though The tongue physically feels soft because it has no bones, but if the tongue's ability to speak is not used wisely, the tongue becomes sharper than a sword. The tongue is able to cut and tear hearts without harming anyone's body. The tongue is sharper than a sword, which means we have to be careful in every word we say so as not to harm ourselves. The sin of the tongue is a sin that comes out of the mouth and is expressed in words that offend other people's feelings. Language is only a small part, but language can also detect a person's physical condition through speech like the one above. This means that someone can find out whether another person is an adult or not, all of this can be known through their words. With his tongue, man praises God's name, but with the same tongue, he curses creatures created in the image and likeness of God. It is in the same language that blessings and curses come (James 3: 1-12), where James emphasizes: \"My brothers, this must not happen to you\" (James 3: 1-12). James reminds Christians who are teachers to be careful in their words, because being a teacher is very difficult (James 3:-1). Christians must control their pronunciation, because they cannot avoid making mistakes in the words that come out of their mouths, because this can have positive and negative impacts.

      "abstract": "Manual laterality (handedness) in humans has some significance for forensic practice where it is primarily employed in the form of handedness preference, based on a simplified three-stage classification (right-handed, left-handed and ambidextrous). In cases of homicide or suicide, the pattern of injuries, particularly cutting or stab injuries and gunshot wounds, may provide clues as to the perpetrator's handedness. In injuries inflicted by another person, the pattern of findings can in isolated cases allow to draw conclusions as to the handedness of the perpetrator. In self-inflicted injuries and suicide, the dominant hand is usually used either alone or as the lead hand. If it is found that fatal injuries were inflicted by the non-dominant hand, this gives rise to doubt that the manner of death is suicide. Evidence of handedness is of little value in distinguishing between suicide and homicide. Due to new developments in dentistry, imaging procedures and especially genetics, the utility of handedness in the identification of unknown persons or cadavers has significantly diminished. In living subjects, useful evidence of handedness can be obtained by observing the performance of specific gestures or activities. The subject should be asked to perform tasks involving one and two hands in a specific sequence. Standardised measurements of the morphology of the shoulders and upper extremities are able to make a statistical distinction between right and left. Since the accuracy of this process is, however, only,around 75 %, morphological determination of handedness should not be used in living subjects, but should be restricted to the identification of unknown cadavers or other post-mortem examinations.",

      "title": "Compulsive Bodies, Creative Bodies: Beckett's<i>Quad</i>and Agency in the 21<sup>st</sup>Century",
      "abstract": "Lying in ditches, tromping through mud, wedged in urns, trash bins, buried in earth, bodies in Beckett appear anything but capable of acting meaningfully on their environments. Bodies in Beckett seem, rather, synonymous with abjection, brokenness, and passivity—as if the human were overcome by its materiality: odours, pain, foot sores, decreased mobility. To the extent that Beckett's personae act, they act vaguely (wandering) or engage in quasi-obsessive, repetitive tasks: maniacal rocking, rotating sucking stones and biscuits, uttering words evacuated of sense, ceaseless pacing. Perhaps the most vivid dramatization of bodies compelled to meaningless, repetitive movement is Quad (1981), Beckett's ‘ballet’ for television, in which four bodies in hooded robes repeat their series ad infinitum. By 1981, has all possibility for intentional action in Beckett been foreclosed? Are we doomed, as Hamm puts it, to an eternal repetition of the same? (‘Moments for nothing, now as always, time was never and time is over, reckoning closed and story ended.’) This article proposes an alternative reading of bodily abjection, passivity and compulsivity in Beckett, a reading that implies a version of agency more capacious than voluntarism. Focusing on Quad as an illustrative case, I show how, if we shift our focus from the body's diminished possibilities for movement to the imbrication of Beckett's personae in environments (a mound of earth), things, and objects, a different story emerges: rather than dramatizing the impossibility of action, Beckett's work may sketch plans for a more ecological, post-human version of agency, a more collaborative mode of ‘acting’ that eases the divide between the human, the world of inanimate objects, and the earth. Movements such as new materialism and object-oriented ontology challenge hierarchies among subjects, objects and environments, questioning the rigid distinction between animate and inanimate, and the notion of the Anthropocene emphasizes the influence of human activity on social and geological space. A major theoretical challenge that arises from such discourses (including 20th-century challenges to the idea of an autonomous, willing, subject) is to arrive at an account of agency robust enough to survive if not the ‘death of the subject’ then its imbrication in the material and social environment it acts upon. Beckett's treatment of the human body suggests a version of agency that draws strength from a body's interaction with its environment, such that meaning is formed in the nexus between body and world. Using the example of Quad, I show how representations of the body in Beckett disturb the opposition between compulsivity (when a body is driven to move or speak in the absence of intention) and creative invention. In Quad, serial repetition works to create an interface between body and world that is receptive to meanings outside the control of a human will. Paradoxically, compulsive repetition in Beckett, despite its uncomfortable closeness to addiction, harnesses a loss of individual control that proposes a more versatile and ecologically mindful understanding of human action.",

      "abstract": "Unlike most Western aesthetics, which recognize (aesthetic) pleasure, independent of other values (truth and falsity, good and evil), as the primary value of aesthetic experience, the various Japanese aesthetics recognize a range of objectives and effects that is more complex. First, there is a wider range of types of aesthetic pleasure. Those best known and most influential in the West include aware/mononoaware (an awareness of the poignance of things, connected to a Buddhist sense of transience and to passing beauty); yūgen (deep or mysterious and powerful beauty, especially in Noh theater); wabi (powerlessness, loneliness, shabbiness, wretchedness); sabi (the beauty accompanying loneliness, solitude, quiet); and shibui (an ascetic quality or astringency, literally the sensation afforded by a pomegranate, which also imparts a rich but sober color to wood stains, etc.). Second, Japanese aesthetic experiences and activities are employed in the service of a wider range of objectives. These include (aesthetic) pleasure and the revelation of truth; self-cultivation that is not only artistic but also physical, social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual; the construction of personal, group, and national identity; and the formulation of relationships. This article begins with an overview of the uniqueness of Japanese aesthetics. It then examines several of the unique objectives of Japanese aesthetics in further detail.",

(Other terms are encountered for the same concepts.) The distinction hinges on whether the action or event is conceived of as requiring an elapse of time; the membership of a verb in one category or the other is therefore a matter of the meaning of the verb itself: ‘look for’ or ‘travel’ or ‘carve’ are inherently durative; ‘find’ or ‘arrive’ or ‘stab’ are inherently punctual. However, durative events can be conceived of as POINTS in future or past time (Alice traveled in Europe last year, punctual in contradistinction to the durative Alice was traveling in Europe when she met her husband), and punctual notions readily can be used in transferred (figurative) senses which are durative: I’m finding that Howard is possessive is an ordinary kind of sentence, whereas I’m finding a cat under the bed is so odd as to be unprocessable.1",

One might argue that judgments as such are not experienced at all, but this is a quibble. We experience the world via our judgments, which is why it is said that our emotions are shaped or structured by judgments. Thus, an essential part of the experience of anger is the experience of being wronged or of having one's intentions frustrated. An essential part of the experience of love is the experience of finding another person attractive and desirable, being drawn to her or him, and later finding this person to be more or less indispensable to one's life. An essential part of the experience of grief is having suffered a terrible loss because one was (and is) bound to another person who is now lost. Again, each of these descriptions is not just a description of “items in our public world;” although, to be sure, it refers to those too. But the person who angers us, the person whom we love or for whom we grieve is not just a person in the world but the person as experienced from the peculiar perspective of the emotion and the person who has the emotion.",

These\r\nmaladjustment's pose as catalysts to anxieties and stubborn thresholds to an individual’s and group’s normal functioning. In Islamic thinking and belief, Muslims admit that the human is made up of two different creations, the spirit and the body. Al Ghazali, one of the great and famous Muslim scholars asserts and misery are caused by the conditions of the soul. The soul is a substance by itself (al Ghazali) but the body of a\r\nhuman being relies on the soul to achieve its optimum functioning. The human soul is not perfect in nature and when it joins the human body, it is subject to some influences of human desires that pollute its status and fall sick with some mischievous diseases. Among the diseases of the soul that have direct implications to hunan functioning are sorrow, excessive anger, unrealistic fear, selfishness, destructive envy, dissatisfaction, rancor, and failure to stick to Allah’s guidance. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to provide some useful interventions that could be used to properly deal with these human\r\npredicaments in the Muslim communities in order to achieve the real happiness in our lives in this world and that of hereafter. Some essential counseling interventions in the\r\nMuslim communities include strengthening their souls, strengthen their Iman, awareness of whom they are (self-awareness), the purpose of their creation, analyzing things and occasions rationally, eradication of negative thinking and self defeating thoughts, patience and prayers, understanding that life calamities are part of our lives as tests, fighting the narcissistic self talk, etc.",

      "title": "Why Patients Mutilate Themselves",
      "abstract": "Self-mutilation, the deliberate destruction or alteration of body tissue without conscious suicidal intent, occurs in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Major self-mutilation includes eye enucleation and amputation of limbs or genitals. Minor self-mutilation includes self-cutting and self-bitting. The author examines patients' explanations for self-mutilation, which frequently focus on religious or sexual themes, and discusses scientific explanations that draw on biological, psychological, social, and cultural theories. Although no one approach adequately solves the riddle of such behaviors, habitual self-mutilation may best be thought of as a purposeful, if morbid, act of self-help.",
