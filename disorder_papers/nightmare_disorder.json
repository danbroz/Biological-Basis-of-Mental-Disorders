      "abstract": "Nightmares are typically extended, elaborate dream narratives, and usually occur during rapid eye movement period of sleep.Nightmare experience is accompanied by the disturbed affect culminating in arousal, which usually involves an individual's efforts to avoid threats to survival, security, or physical integrity, but often results in awakening with rapid orientation and alertness [1].Nightmare experience might also leave the individual negative emotions and cause obvious distress, emotional deregulation, or impairment in social, occupational, or other functions [2].",

      "abstract": "Nightmares are scary or disturbing dreams which are associated with negative feelings, such as fear, terror or disgust. These feelings oftentimes awake the dreamer, who can easily recollect the content of the nightmare. Nightmares are not necessarily a symptom of a disease. Moreover, nightmares with little emotional response are experienced by almost all people once in a while without any risk for their health. However, nightmares that occur frequently and disturb the sleep might lead to clinically significant impairments in social, professional and other areas of life. They are considered a sleep disorder (parasomnia) and require a proper treatment. This review discusses the theoretical models of nightmares, their causes, diagnostics and treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in REM Sleep Parasomnia",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behavioral or physiological events that intrude into the sleep process disrupting its continuity. Parasomnia associated to REM sleep include REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorders, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (SP), and sleep-related painful erections. The quality of life of patients suffering from parasomnias may vary according to the disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder patients experience recurrent vivid and violent dreams and frequent sleep-related injuries for themselves or bed partners, with possible impacts on personal, couple, and social life. Despite the possible awakening from REM sleep, sleep architecture is usually preserved in RBD. Idiopathic RBD may often precede a neurodegenerative disease, and its diagnosis might imply a psychological burden for patients and their family. The increased risk for neurodegenerative illnesses poses the ethical dilemma whether the patient should or should not be told about, especially in view of the current lack of effective neuroprotective strategies and the lack of knowledge about the precise extent of this risk. Nightmares are intensely disturbing dreams involving a variety of dysphoric emotions, most often fear and anxiety. Nightmares have been correlated to various measures of psychopathology, namely neuroticism, anxiety, depression, but not all studies support this relationship. Personality factors, such as nightmare frequency, nightmare distress (ND), and coping style, appear to be important in modulating the clinical severity of nightmare disorder. Parasomnias, especially nightmare and SP, can lead to postawakening anxiety with difficulty returning to sleep, sleep avoidance, and sleep deprivation, with subsequent insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and intensification of the parasomnia REM-rebound related.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the most significant of human behaviors, occupying roughly one-third of human life. Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

Sleepwalking represents the milder form of arousal, while night terrors are distinguished by the intense physiological experiences associated with alarm: screaming, pounding heart, rapid breathing, sweating, extreme terror or panic, and possibly frenzied motor activity. Both sleepwalking and night terrors usually occur during the first 3 hours after falling asleep but may occur at any time of night. They arise from non-REM sleep, generally sleep stages 3 or 4. There may be physical signs of traumatic injuries sustained during episodes of sleepwalking or night terrors. Most patients with sleepwalking/night terrors have a childhood history and/or a family history of these behaviors. There may also be a history of bedwetting.",

      "title": "S27-04 - Sleep Disorders, Mental Health and Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients. In my presentation I will cover the most important aspects of the complex relationship between sleep disorders, mental and physical health and quality of life.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

Factors connected with the increased prevalence of sleep disturbance are female gender, presence of mental or somatic diseases and advanced age. Sleep disturbances are classified in four basic groups: insufficient quantity or unrestorative sleep (insomnia); prolonged sleep (excessive daily somnolence or hypersomnia); problems with timing of sleep and problems close to or within the sleep process (parasomnias).",

These diagnostic uncertainties are often the result of insufficiently detailed descriptions and a general lack of awareness of the many different types of nocturnal disturbance.

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

An intimate link between pain, mood, and sleep is apparent. Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions.

The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

Jet lag and shift work that temporarily disrupt the normal sleep cycle also are considered to be extrinsic sleep disorders. Daytime sleepiness is a very common presenting symptom. It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur. Symptoms that seem bizarre and occur in association with nocturnal sleep or daytime napping should be considered as possible expressions of sleep pathology rather than psychopathology.",

The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

Poor sleep quality is seen in adults with anxiety disorders such as specific phobia, social phobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Objective data obtained from polysomnograms support this claim in many instances. Nocturnal panic occurs frequently in patients with sleep apnea and may predispose to the development of panic disorder. Insomnia is a trait marker for depression, and may also be one for anxiety disorders.

Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder may kick and flail, scream, fall out of bed, or engage in complex behavior that emerges from the content of their vivid, fearful dreams. Patients usually seek help only after they have injured themselves or their bed partners during sleep. Serious physical injury is possible. Often REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the use of psychotropic medication or with a definable underlying neurological disorder. In an acute form of REM sleep behavior disorder, there is a more sudden onset of symptoms as a consequence of a toxic or abnormal metabolic state, including alcohol withdrawal, or in association with the use or discontinuation of psychotropic medications.",

Complaints about sleep pattern changes may occur during any phase of the disease. These include frequent night-time awakenings, poor sleep quality, reduction of the total sleeping time (TST) and decreased latency and increased density of REM sleep. In the depressive phase, patients also reveal insomnia/hypersomnia, difficulty waking up and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep pattern fluctuations are frequent in bipolar disorders and have a great clinic implication as a symptom. The corrections of sleep disturbances observed in bipolar disorder should be considered a therapeutic priority, since they prevent symptoms recurrence and smooth the socio-professional integration, thus providing greater success in patient's rehabilitation and quality of life.",

Each year in the United States greater than 50,000motor vehicle accidents are attributed to driving while drowsy (4). Sleepiness has many causes including insufficient sleep, sleep disorders, medical and neurological illness, and medication side effects. This chapter focuses on sleep disorders where excessive sleepiness is the primary symptom; this includes narcolepsy (sporadic and secondary), idiopathic hypersomnia, hypersomnia due to medical conditions (posttraumatic hypersomnia), recurrent hypersomnia, and behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome.",

These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3.

Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

The inability to focus or maintain concentration is the most disabling aspect of conditions causing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), described as 'brain fog' or even masquerading as dementia. The commonest causes of mild and severe EDS are probably insufficient sleep and poor quality overnight sleep, respectively. Sleep onset or sleep maintainance insomnia can reflect an idiopathic or primary phenomenon but is more often secondary to a variety of disorders, including other primary sleep disorders. In patients with underlying neuropathies, radiculopathies or demyelinating disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be secondary to the primary diagnosis and should not be overlooked.

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is a chronic mental disorder characterised by high recurrence. There are numerous manic or hypomanic episodes in the course of the disease. Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it. The case report presented herein shows the difficulties in diagnosing severe cognitive disorders during a depressive episode in the course of BPAD and the difficulties in differentiating between them and dementia, as well as presents the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

This rapid eye movement (REM)-intrusion phenomenon occurs when the muscle atonia from REM sleep pervades into wakefulness. Patients often experience a conscious awareness of their surroundings, coupled with a sense of suffocation and significant clinical distress, usually lasting for seconds up to several minutes. Though it is often associated with narcolepsy, sleep paralysis can be seen in any condition where there is sleep disruption and is most commonly seen in younger patients who have significant sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep. It is also associated with other common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, and can be part of the differential diagnosis for numerous other related conditions such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and nocturnal panic attacks. Obtaining a comprehensive sleep history is essential in accurately characterizing episodes, and for determining the underlying etiology. Treatment of sleep paralysis is largely focused on preventing sleep disruption, and with reassurance and education. Pharmacologic therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be considered in severe and refractory cases.",

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase.

Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders can be broadly classified into: (a) insomnia, (b) parasomnia, (c) sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurologic and other medical disorders, and (d) proposed sleep disorders (e.g. pregnancy and menstrual related sleep disorders).1 Insomnia is a common encounter in primary care consultations2 and constitutes the commonest sleep problem3,4 that presents to the general practitioner. Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

That is, the hypnagogic state could be a kind of reluctance to sleep because sleeping means to meet the failing protective object. Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

The major sleep disorders discussed in this chapter are insomnia (characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality), hypersomnia or hypersomnolence (characterized by excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy (caused by loss of orexin neurones in the central nervous system (CNS), mutations in orexin receptors or deficits in the synthesis of orexin and characterized by an urge to sleep) and cataplexy (typified by bilateral weakness of the skeletal muscles). Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Noise‐induced hearing loss due to intense and long‐term noise exposure is no longer disputed since the etiology is well defined. However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

More common in children than adults, sleepwalking is usually outgrown by the teen years. Isolated incidents of sleepwalking often don't signal any serious problems or require treatment. However, recurrent sleepwalking may suggest an underlying sleep disorder. Sleepwalking in adults features a higher probability of being incoherent with or coexistent with different sleep disorders similarly as medical conditions. If anyone in your social unit sleepwalks, it is vital to shield him or her from potential injuries associated with sleeping.",

Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is the most frequent respiratory sleep disorder. It involves repeated episodes of total (apnoea) or partial (hypopnea) obstruction at night. RLS or Willis-Ekbom disease is a relatively common pathology, with a prevalence of around 2.7%. It is underdiagnosed, which has a negative impact on both the quality of sleep and the patient's life. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization of the sleep/wake rhythm with the light/darkness cycle, generating an unbalanced sleep cycle. REM sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by abnormal repetitive behaviours, such as sleep-related vocalization and complex motor behaviours (intense and violent) during REM sleep, which can cause injuries or sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

In the present day and age sleep disorders irrespective of the reason the growth in the sleep disorders is alarming. Although many people tend to experience sleep disturbances on an occasional basis owing to stressful life situations, alterations in job schedules, traveling, and many other external influences, but when these issues occur regularly and become an impedance in the day-to-day activities, it may be suggestive of a sleeping disorder. A deficiency of a good quality sleep can have overall undesirable consequences on the vitality, temperament, attentiveness, and well-being of an individual. Sleep difficulties are linked to both physical and emotional problems. Sleep problems can both contribute to and exacerbate existing mental problems as well as serve as an important indicator of other mental health conditions. While the various sleep problems may resolve on its own or eventually conclude after a successful course of therapy, in a few resistant cases the treatment normally involves a combination of medical treatments and lifestyle changes.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks.

It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

Sleepiness is an inevitable result of sleep deprivation, and when the magnitude of sleepiness is high, the risk of inattention, poor performance, negative mood, and accidents is great. Jet lag was discussed under transient insomnia as sleep disruptive. However, it is the circadian-mediated sleepiness during desired or required waking hours that is often the most problematic component of the jet lag syndrome. Evidence that treatment of transient insomnia reduces or eliminates the sequelae of acute sleep deprivation outside of a laboratory environment is lacking.

Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive.

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy.

Sleep deficiency can lead to physical and mental health problems, injuries, loss of productivity, and even a greater risk of death. Sleep deprivation is seen in several psychiatric disorders, and there may be a cause or effect relationship. Sleep-deprived individuals may have trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling their emotions and behavior, and coping with stress or change. We report a case who started having sleep deprivation over 15 days following a stressor, which resulted in an acute psychosis-like condition with associated disorientation and perplexity. However, the patient responded to benzodiazepine medication given for the restoration of her sleep cycle and did not require any antipsychotics. There was also complete amelioration of her behavioral and thought disturbances.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

The most important forms of anxiety disorders in psychosomatic primary care are panic disorder, agoraphobia and generalised anxiety disorder. Very often anxiety symptoms are hidden by physical symptoms. Basic psychosocial interventions include strengthening autonomy, explaining the vicious circle of fear and also relaxation techniques (breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation). The core features of obsessive compulsive disorder are obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (performance of highly ritualized behaviours intended to neutralise the negative thoughts and emotions resulting from the obsessions).",

      "abstract": "In the vast majority of patients with parasomnias, the evaluation can be accomplished in the office setting, based on information from the patients themselves and family members or other observers of the nocturnal events. Parasomnias are episodic sleep disorders that include sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares. All three conditions are more prevalent in childhood, when developmental factors appear to be responsible for their occurrence; in the much less frequent cases of a delayed onset or persistence in adulthood, psychopathologic states are often primary in their cause. Based on a number of clinical, physiologic, and etiopathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and night terrors, these two conditions appear to fall along the same pathophysiologic and therefore nosologic continuum. They are both disorders of impaired arousal, characterized by various degrees of confusion, and they occur early in the night when slow-wave sleep predominates, whereas nightmares may occur at any time of the night, because they are closely associated with REM sleep. Another important issue relating to the assessment of parasomnias is to differentiate between nightmares and night terrors: in addition to the different time of night for their occurrence, nightmares are accompanied by much less anxiety, vocalization, motility, and autonomic discharge. Also, nightmare patients usually have vivid and elaborate recall for the event, whereas patients with night terrors are typically amnesic for their episodes, as are patients who sleepwalk. A mainstay in the management of sleepwalking and night terrors is instructing the patients and their family members to provide for adequate safety measures to prevent accidents that may occur during these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society.

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Pain is well known to be a common dominant symptom in people with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Perhaps less well acknowledged by healthcare professionals are fatigue and sleep disturbances in these patients. Individually these symptoms are problematic but when combined their effect and impact on patients' lives is greatly amplified; often leaving people in a vicious cycle whereby being in pain results in poor sleep leading to fatigue the next day, which lowers patients' pain tolerance resulting in a poorer night\"s sleep, more fatigue and increased pain. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance greatly reduce quality of life for people with RMDs. Patients have to adapt their daily and leisure activities, or give them up altogether with negative psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression. Patients can end up feeling helpless and sometimes suicidal. Relationships with partners and friends are often altered affecting their sexual and social lives. Major life decisions, such as having a baby, can be put on hold or shelved. People with RMDs may also have to reduce their working hours or stop working, which has financial repercussions for them and their families. This can exacerbate stress, anxiety and depression leading to poorer health outcomes. It is therefore of great importance that healthcare professionals understand the extent to which pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties impact on patients' lives so that priority can be given to addressing these distressing symptoms as part of any management strategy. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

The main mental symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia are a consequence of the daytime sleepiness or difficulty awakening. “Sleep drunkenness” upon awakening, including symptoms of confusion, disorientation, and poor motor coordination that may last for minutes to more than an hour. Many individuals with idiopathic hypersomnia have difficulty getting to their morning commitments on time. In addition, their daytime somnolence may interfere significantly with cognitive, social, and occupational functioning. Idiopathic hypersomnia usually begins in late adolescence or childhood, but it is often not diagnosed. Patients generally present with complaints of daytime sleepiness. Patients generally are first affected during late adolescence and early adulthood, with a smaller number reporting onset during childhood or middle age.",

      "title": "Anxiety disorders in the structure of stress-related disorders in forced immigrants",
      "abstract": "In the modern world, anxiety is an important part of life. Physiological anxiety is a normal emotional response to stress, a biological response to a threat. Anxiety allows you to protect yourself and your loved ones from harm and prepare for significant events, and also serves as an important signal to take strong action in a stressful situation. The study and understanding of the specifics of the clinical structure, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders in persons who have suffered as a result of hostilities is indeed the main concern for social and medical issues of our society. As the results of the study showed, patients most often complain of the following symptoms: the affect of longing (boredom, despondency, sadness, sorrow), depressed mood, a feeling of tension, danger and tightness, difficulties in adapting to new surroundings, anxiety over small things, irritability and impatience, lack of hope and prospects, internal tension with the inability to relax, a sense of loss of control over one's life, obsessive fears, sleep disorders, psycho-traumatic memories, fears and fixation on subjectively significant negative information about events in the occupied territories. In the clinical structure of post-traumatic stress disorders in the examined patients, it was found: post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1), adjustment disorders (prolonged anxiety-depressive reaction) (F43.21), anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and panic disorder (F41.0). The data obtained became the basis for the development of a comprehensive personalized program for the correction of anxiety disorders and rehabilitation of persons with forced displacement. The personalized program was with differentiated use of methods of psychopharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Keywords: biosugestive therapy, anxiety, depression, correction programs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nightmares are defined as disturbing dreams associated with anxiety or fear that result in an awakening from sleep. The subject usually is readily aroused to full alertness and is able to recall much of the content of the dream. This distinguishes nightmares from night terrors, which are associated with a prolonged transition to wakefulness and scant recall of dream narrative. Although nightmares are featured prominently in literature and descriptive psychoanalytic writings, there is limited empirical research on this phenomenon. This fact is driven in part by pragmatic scientific limitations that make it difficult to observe neurocognitive events during the actual dream. Dreams can only be recalled following an awakening, and the fidelity of recall is not known. For example, it is possible that dream recall is limited to dream events occurring in the immediate period just prior to arousal. Further, dream recall is subject to retrieval biases in which the subject imposes order on what has been a chaotic mental experience.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS. With any form of sleep-related dissociative disorder, onset can be gradual and sporadic in nature. Females are reported to be affected predominantly, and onset can range from childhood to midlife. Sexualized and frankly sexual behaviors can emerge with sleep-related dissociative disorders.

Sleepwalking and sleep terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. Genetic, developmental, and psychological factors have been identified as causes of both sleepwalking and sleep terrors. Sleepwalking and sleep terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually outgrown by the end of adolescence.? When sleepwalking or sleep terrors have a post-pubertal onset or continue to adulthood, psychopathology is a more significant causative factors. The behavior that occur from deep slow-wave sleep can be painful or dangerous to the individual and/or disturbing to those close to that individual. The assessment of patients suspected of having these conditions requires a thorough medical and sleep history. The most important consideration in managing patients with sleepwalking or sleep terrors episodes is protection from injury. Language: ko",

      "title": "Health Effects of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "title": "A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NIGHTMARES AND NIGHT TERRORS",
      "abstract": "Anxious arousals originate from all sleep stages and can be classified as: a) stage 4 night terrors; b) rapid eye movement (REM) nightmares; c) stage 2 awakenings; and d) hypnagogic nightmares. We have confirmed Broughton's finding that the night terror, the most severe type of episode, does not occur in sleep but as part of the \"arousal response,\" a complex of autonomic discharge and behavioral symptoms. The full blown night terror is a fight-flight episode combining sleep utterances, sleep walking and hallucinated or delusional mental content associated with terror. There is a significant positive correlation between intensity of night terror and the amount of delta sleep preceding arousal, e.g., stage 4 arousals designated as night terrors are preceded by longer periods of stage 4 than arousals of lesser intensity (p <.05). About two-thirds of both stage 4 and night terrors occurs in the first non-REM (NREM) period. The night terror arises out of physiologically quiescent sleep as indicated by the normal or slightly less them normal cardiorespiratory rates during the first NREM period and absence of skin resistance changes prior to the attack. The night terror is ushered in by sudden loud piercing screams, the subject passing into an aroused state characterized by alpha rhythm, motility, often somnambulism, intense autonomic discharge (precipitous doubling or even tripling of heart rate, great increase in respiratory amplitude, marked decrease in skin resistance), brief duration (1 to 3 minutes), varying degrees of amnesia for the episode, and rapid return to sleep. The night terror is a much more severe phenomenon than the REM nightmare although the latter is far more frequent. The nightmare occurs in REM sleep, is characterized by slight autonomic fluctuations, compared to the night terror, and, in half of instances, a \"desomatization\" of the anxiety response, that is, absence of its physiological concomitants. The REM state is physiologically activated to begin with, constituting a preparation for fright, possibly a buffer against the extreme terror of the stage 4 variety. The important problem of the triggering mechanisms of the night terror remains unsolved: whether the attack is precipitated by ongoing mental content during delta sleep, or represents a psychosomatic \"arousal response\" (Broughton). The fact that it can be induced artificially by sounding a buzzer speaks in favor of the latter, the finding of significant mental content in favor of the former. The night terror is not a dream but a symptom emerging from stage 3-4 sleep, associated with a rift in the ego's capacity to control anxiety.",

      "abstract": "NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) SLEEPNon-REM sleep parasomnias are very common in childhood and are usually benign, rarely coming to medical attention.They typically arise from the first period of deepest non-REM (slow wave) sleep, around an hour after sleep onset.Over time, a spectrum of behaviours may be seen, even in the same subject, varying from brief confused arousals to frank sleepwalking.Agitated events may be seen, especially in younger age groups, leading to disturbing 'night terrors'.Despite apparent severe distress and intense autonomic activation, the child rarely recalls the nocturnal events.Because they are thought to reflect an incomplete transition from deep sleep to wakefulness, non-REM parasomnias are often termed 'arousal disorders'.Most non-REM sleep parasomnias improve through adolescence but may persist on a regular basis in at least 1% of adults.An enormous range of behaviours may be reported, some of which are complex and potentially hazardous.In adulthood, subjects appear to be more prone to exhibiting activities which may be considered 'goal-seeking' in nature, including eating or cooking.Males, in particular, while in a state of parasomnia, may engage in intimate relations with bed partners or display violence.Subsequent recall is invariably absent or severely diminished although some report dream-like or hallucinatory images, particularly if the parasomnia is associated with significant agitation.Common themes include spiders or other unpleasant visual imagery.Often, there is simply a sense of 'impending doom' causing the subject to rush from the bedroom, often vocalising and disturbing partners.It is usually possible to communicate at a limited level with subjects in this state although they typically display a degree of confusion and appear only partially awake.Typically, an adult with a significant non-REM sleep parasomnia will have events from deep slow wave sleep within an hour or two of sleep onset.Events rarely occur more than once a night but may cluster with several symptomatic nights in a week.Often, there are more prolonged spells free of disturbances.The behaviours across nights might be similar but are not precisely stereotyped.Triggers or precipitants are often identified and include internal factors that tend to deepen non-REM sleep (such as sleep deprivation) or external factors (such as an uncomfortable or noisy environment) which may partially arouse the deeply sleeping subject.Although controlled evidence is limited, short-acting hypnotics such as zolpidem may induce sleepwalking or similar behaviours in predisposed individuals.Similarly, alcohol in some may appear to trigger parasomnias, potentially through secondary factors such as sleep deprivation, increased snoring or a full bladder.By contrast, in clinical ABSTRACT It is common for general physicians to experience diagnostic doubt and trepidation whenever faced with patients who exhibit abnormal nocturnal behaviours or excessive movements at night.There is also a perception that expensive and often poorly available overnight tests are usually required for diagnostic precision.In fact, the majority of conditions, whether they be parasomnias or, more rarely, nocturnal seizures, can be reliably diagnosed from a directed history, if available.Although the evidence base for treating parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders remains minimal, accurate recognition is important for a variety of reasons.This review covers the diagnostic features of the full range of parasomnias and movement disorders that might present to a multidisciplinary adult sleep clinic.Throughout, it will be argued that the recognition of key or salient features obtained from a good history is the most important diagnostic tool.Indeed, when diagnostic doubt remains after a thorough sleep history, it is relatively rare for detailed tests to add much in the way of useful information.",

Narcoleptic patients experience excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Narcolepsy is about as prevalent as multiple sclerosis, and can be as disabling in its consequences, yet it is underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Because (narcoleptic) undesired sleep episodes can occur at any time, they have severe detrimental effects on daily functions, safety, and work. Patients may fall asleep involuntarily while at work or school, during social activities, or while driving or operating hazardous machinery. Suffering many psychosocial and work-related problems, narcoleptic patients face a lifetime of poorer health and quality of life than people without narcolepsy (Figure 1). Whereas no cure is available for narcolepsy, treatment of its symptoms can help minimize its harmful effects.

This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

Sleep disorders affect all aspects of health, showing a bi-directionality with health conditions and comorbidity with several diseases. Consequently, sleep disorders may have severe negative consequences both for the individual and the enterprise, as well as for society on the whole, in terms of health, productivity and social costs. When considering the disturbances of the sleep/wake cycle, it is important to distinguish between those connected with endogenous biological factors from those related to socio-environmental conditions, including work, and those associated with mental and physical diseases, that are often associated and interact with each other. Many sleep disorders are still underestimated and under-valued in clinical practice and, to a much greater extent, in workers' health surveillance. The present paper is aimed at drawing the attention of the occupational health physician to some key issues, particularly regarding excessive daytime sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and shift and night work, as well as their implications in terms of health and occupational consequences.

Sleepwalking and related disorders typically follow sudden, partial awakenings from deep sleep.

Sleepwalking and related disorders are noted to occur during deep sleep and often require a genetic predisposition or priming factors.

      "abstract": "Insomnia symptoms are the most common medical complaints, affecting up to a third of the general population. Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia, <scp>REM</scp> sleep instability and emotional dysregulation: A pathway to anxiety and depression?",
      "abstract": "Summary The world‐wide prevalence of insomnia disorder reaches up to 10% of the adult population. Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (“rapid eye movement sleep instability”), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious‐like wake experience, reflecting pre‐sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "It is rarely possible to ascribe to bed rest alone the disorders which become manifest in patients confined to bed during the treatment of disease or injury. Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

Patients with EDS have often been misdiagnosed with depression due to their complaints of lack of energy and poor concentration. Also, they have even been diagnosed erroneously with a psychotic disorder in case of coexistence with hypnagogic hallucination. EDS can seriously affect the person's quality of life by causing decreased academic achievement or work performance, low self esteem, and social withdrawal. EDS is also frequently associated with various medical and psychiatric conditions, and often fatal traffic or on-the-job accidents. The causes of EDS range from insufficient sleep to central nervous system-originated hypersomnia. The conditions that can lead to EDS include circadian rhythm disorders, primary disorders of alertness such as narcolepsy, sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, sleep-related movement disorders such as periodic limb movement disorder and restless legs syndrome, chronic medical conditions such as cancer, and medications causing sleepiness. Treatment options should be tailored according to the underlying condition and include sufficient sleep time, light therapy, sleep scheduling, wakefulness-promoting medications, or mechanical airway managements such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).",

The most common sleep disorders in schizophrenia are insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders. The relevance of insomnia should be emphasized, as it can be a prodromal signof schizophrenia, as well as an alarm sign of an incipient psychotic decompensation. Additionally, the clinical recovery of a psychotic process is usually correlated with sleep normalization. Multiple polysomnographic disturbances on sleep architecture have been found in patients with schizophrenia, including increased sleep latency, awakenings during sleep, sleep-wake cycle inversion, as well as poor sleep efficiency. These objective disturbances have been correlated to subjective poor sleep quality and other main clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) may occur normally, but is considered indicative of disease when it occurs at a level of activity that is usually well tolerated. Dyspnea should be differentiated from tachypnea, hyperventilation, and hyperpnea, which refer to respiratory variations regardless of the patients subjective sensations. Tachypnea is an increase in the respiratory rate above normal; hyperventilation is increased minute ventilation relative to metabolic need, and hyperpnea is a disproportionate rise in minute ventilation relative to an increase in metabolic level. These conditions may not always be associated with dyspnea.Orthopnea is the sensation of breathlessness in the recumbent position, relieved by sitting or standing. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a sensation of shortness of breath that awakens the patient, often after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, and is usually relieved in the upright position.Two uncommon types of breathlessness are trepopnea and platypnea. Trepopnea is dyspnea that occurs in one lateral decubitus position as opposed to the other. Platypnea refers to breathlessness that occurs in the upright position and is relieved with recumbency.",

Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "abstract": "Even in non-sleep-deprived persons, sleepiness occurs at two particular periods of the day, i.e., during the night at the time of normal sleep and in the early afternoon, at the time of the siesta in certain cultures. This can be shown by measuring the physiological tendency to sleep as the latency to sleep in brief naps (Richardson, et al, 1982). Increases in sleepiness can result from sleep deprivation (inadequate sleep) or from sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. Subjects who are excessively sleepy, from whatever cause, have performance lapses and slowed reaction times and an accelerated loss of attentional vigilance (Dinges, 1992). They, moreover will exhibit the phenomenon of microsleeps, i.e., sleepy subjects may fall asleep in an unpredictable fashion and be temporarily unaware of their surroundings. These behavioral changes that occur in sleepy individuals can have important consequences. The consequences will depend on the environment that the subject is in. Perhaps the most dangerous situation is while driving. Crashes occur in individuals who fall asleep at the wheel. Such crashes can be serious with resulting fatalities (Parsons, 1986). That this occurs has been known for some time (for review of earlier work in this area, see Shinar, 1978). The goal of the study described in this report was to investigate, in detail, the characteristics of accidents attributed on the police report to the driver having fallen asleep. The study was a retrospective analysis of data from the state of North Carolina. We analyzed data for the years 1990 to 1992, inclusive.

The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance.

Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias occur from deep NREM sleep and often involve complex behaviours that may appear purposeful but are not conscious or under deliberate control. There are a number of different types/presentations of NREM parasomnias. These may range from common manifestations such as sleeptalking, sleepwalking or night terrors, to the rarer sleep-related eating disorder or sexsomnia. Clinical features can facilitate the differential diagnosis, but polysomnography may be needed, particularly to assess potential concomitant sleep disorders that might represent precipitating factors. Medical treatment is often not indicated, but clonazepam or antidepressants may be used in more severe cases. Safety aspects, treating concomitant sleep disorders and avoiding trigger factors are key aspects of management.",

      "title": "Sleepwalking and night terrors related to febrile illness",
      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

It is a normal state and a spur to action, but readily exceeds normal limits in intensity, duration and appropriateness to the stimulus or situation. Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of parasomnias occurring in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Disorders of arousal are characterized by dissociated sleep, with wake and sleep phenomena intermingling, and local sleep, in which different areas of the brain exist simultaneously in different states of wakefulness or sleep. The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders: Disorders of Arousal?",
      "abstract": "In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems. Or, the schedule may be irregular, sleep/wake rhythms may not adjust, and any of a variety of apparent sleep disorders may appear.",

The presence of recurrent periods of irresistible sleep in the same day was found in 13.2%, recurrent naps in the same day in 1.9%, non-restorative sleep despite a nighttime sleep of more than 9 hours (0.7%), as well as a sleep drunkenness (4.4%). Adding criteria for duration and frequency (minimum of 3 times per week and duration of at least 3 months), having social or professional impairment and psychological distress, and after excluding significant associated comorbidities, the prevalence fall to 1.5%. These very important prevalence hypersomnolence figures constitute an excellent argument to educate doctors and health authorities on the need to identify and support the excessive sleepiness disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Furthermore, longitudinal studies indicate that complaints of disturbed sleep (in the absence of depression) at baseline are associated with an increased risk of depression at follow-up. Insomnia is often considered one of the most distressing symptoms by people experiencing depression, and is known to be associated with reduced quality of life, and increased risk of recurrence and suicide.

      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "abstract": "The authors review the literature on the epidemiology, the clinical and electrophysiological symptoms of somnambulism. The disorder specified as \"nREM parasomnia with awakening disorder\" belongs to the nREM sleep (awakening) parasomnias. In most of the cases its occurence is familial with the highest prevalence at age 12 year. Above age 12 year most cases recover whereas 6% of prevalence is reported in adults. It is probable that most patients seek medical help only in severe cases associated with injuries, accidents or violence. Its etiology is unknown; in essence it is a sleep regulation disorder characterised by a dissociated state of partial awakening from nREM sleep: the motor system becomes awake while consciousness remains clouded. There are several medicines inducing somnambulism in patients otherwise free from this disorder. In somnambule patients the most important provoking factors are sleep deprivation as well as pathological states and circumstances evoking sleep loss. Somnambulism should be differentiated from complex partial epileptic seizures and REM behaviour disorder. As there is no specific treatment at the moment it is important to assure safe sleeping circumstances - ground flour, closed windows, and no fragile furniture. Clonazepam and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prove sometimes effective, but the most effective methods in decreasing the frequency of somnambule episodes are the regular sleep-wakefulness schedule and the avoidance of sleep deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Respiratory dysfunction in sleep is common in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring at a significantly higher rate than in the general population. Regulation of sleep is mediated by opposing actions of the anterior and posterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus. Insomnia is characterized as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, awakening in morning, or non-restorative sleep. The negative effects of shift work include sleepiness and insomnia, reduced alertness, and greater risk of re-injury, overall poor health, low work productivity, and poor quality of life. The sleep diary has been used in the TBI population for assessing sleep quality and quantity, and for identifying factors that may affect sleep and wakefulness.

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be \"things that go bump in the night\", or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

      "abstract": "Even though most cancer patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for any specific mental disorder [1], many experience symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbances that may interfere with their overall adjustment to their disease. Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease. This paper will focus on anxiety and sleep disorders in the oncology setting and will describe their clinical presentation, assessment, aetiology and treatment.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

It refers to the consequence of the failure of an organism human or animal to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats, whether actual or imagined.Signs of stress may be cognitive, emotional, physical or behavioral. Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work. According to the current World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, occupational or work-related stress is the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope.Job satisfactionThe job satisfaction the end feeling of a person after performing a task. To the extent that a person's job fulfill his expectations and values, the job will be satisfying. The feeling will be positive or negative depending upon whether need satisfied or not.The job satisfaction of professional women as important as the organizational climate of any organization. Organization climate a leading indicator of organizational performance. Organizational climate may be thought of as the summary perception, which people have about an organization. It a global expression of what an organization is. Organization climate manifestation of attitudes of organizational members towards the organizational itself. Motivation and behaviour of organizational members are significantly influenced by organizational climate. Research on organization climate and its determinants important for enhancing organizational effectiveness, thus making them more relevant for society in general. Good citizenship behaviour in and organization beyond the call of duty rather scarce, but highly sought after by organizations today.The focal importance of a professional women not new to organization thinking.

In humans, it the general condition of a person in mind, body and spirit, usually meaning to being free from illness, injury or pain (as in good or healthy)the World Health Organization (who) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as having a lack of operational value and the problem created by use of the word complete, it remains the most enduring. Classification systems such as the who family of international classifications, which composed of the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) and the international classification of diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.General health, organizational stress and job satisfactionA study was conducted on general health, stress associated to the work and job satisfaction of Hormozgan cement factory employees in Iran by Tabatabaei , Hosseinianb, and Gharanjiki (2011), The aim of the paper was to study the general health, stress associated to the work and job satisfaction of the Hormozgan cement factory employees. …",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep paralysis is one of the many conditions of which visual hallucinations can be a part but has received relatively little attention. It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia, a more or less chronic sleep disturbance, is a very common symptom in psychiatric patients but also relatively freguent in the general population to a lesser degree. Two broad types of insomnia may often be distinguished: (1) difficulty falling asleep and frequent wakening, characteristic of anxiety states or obsessive worrying; and (2) early morning wakening, sometimes in a panic, suggestive of endogenous depression. The first group of patients respond well to minor tranquilizers and psychotherapy, whereas the second do well with tricyclic anti-depressants. Many studies in sleep laboratories have declineated the stages and cycles of sleep physiology and pathology, especially the importance of REM or dreaming sleep. The clinician should be cautious in the use of hypnotics like barbiturates which suppress REM sleep and produce a rebound increase on withdrawal, as well as problems of dependence of habituation. Flurazepam and chloral hydrate are considerably safer in this respect. Understanding sleep neurophysiology and biochemistry permits appropriate individual clinical management for both psychiatric patients and medical patients with conditions like peptic ulcer and nocturnal angina pectoris.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "Editorial: Psychological sleep studies: new insights to support and integrate clinical practice within the healthcare system, volume II",
      "abstract": "Sleep health is essential for overall physical and mental well-being. Insufficient sleep, whether in terms of quantity or quality, significantly impacts an individual's quality of life and day-to-day functioning [1]. Consequences of sleep disorders like insomnia include impaired daytime cognition, reduced work productivity, an increased risk of accidents and injuries, and have been linked to psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic health conditions. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].Sleep problems may compromise with the treatments that are currently being administered for a wide range of illnesses. When these disorders are addressed, they have the potential to enhance the patient's quality of life and adherence to therapy, as well as the intensity of the psychological symptoms that they are experiencing. It has been shown that there is a complicated association between sleep and mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress disorders. This interaction is considered to be bidirectional [2], [16], [17]. There is a growing demand in the clinical setting for psychologists who are skilled in evidence-based psychotherapy to become members of multidisciplinary health teams. These psychologists would be tasked with providing cognitive-behavioral intervention and support for patients suffering from insomnia [18], narcolepsy [19], [20], and adherence to treatment for obstructive sleep apnea [21].This volume brings together a collection of research that delves into different aspects of sleep health and its relationship with psychological well-being, offering new approaches to addressing these challenges in various populations. The findings provide critical implications for clinical practice, aiming to improve sleep health management across diverse healthcare settings.Luo et al. [22] investigate the mental health challenges, particularly anxiety and poor sleep, experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their study shows that Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) significantly alleviates anxiety and improves sleep quality among practitioners in high-stress environments like mobile cabin hospitals. The intervention demonstrated a reduction in both anxiety and poor sleep indices, offering an accessible and effective solution to mitigate mental health strains during pandemicrelated crises.This study highlights the potential of PMR as a non-invasive, cost-effective intervention that could be readily implemented in healthcare systems to support the mental health of frontline workers. Given the global scale of the healthcare crisis, integrating such tools into standard healthcare practice could enhance workforce wellbeing and performance.In their study, O'Regan et al. [23] explore the patient journey in managing insomnia across Europe and Canada. By mapping the phases of insomnia management, from self-initiated behavioral changes to long-term reliance on prescription medications, the authors reveal a considerable gap in the alignment of healthcare provider strategies and patient needs. Their research uncovers key points where interventions can be improved, particularly in addressing patient expectations and enhancing education around sleep hygiene and nonpharmacological treatments.Overall, the findings show that patient education is crucial to remove the stigma surrounding insomnia, helping patients recognize that chronic insomnia is a primary disorder that requires appropriate medical management, and encouraging them to seek help earlier. Additionally, healthcare provider education and training on sleep disorders are essential to increase the perception of chronic insomnia as a serious primary medical condition and to fully understand its significant impact on patients' daily lives. Furthermore, the current situation, in which many patients must settle for \"manageable\" insomnia, highlights a serious unmet need regarding the management and treatment of this condition. More comprehensive approaches are needed to ensure that patients receive effective care that goes beyond symptom management, addressing the root causes of their insomnia and improving their long-term health outcomes.Wale et al. [24] shed light on the high prevalence of insomnia among university students in Ethiopia. Their study identifies key predictors, including gender, age, mild anxiety symptoms, and excessive use of mobile devices before bedtime, which significantly contribute to poor sleep quality among students. The findings underscore the impact of lifestyle factors and mental health challenges on sleep patterns in young adults, a group particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances due to academic stress and lifestyle transitions.The study calls for targeted interventions focusing on mental health support and promoting better sleep hygiene among university students. Educational institutions should integrate sleep health education into their wellness programs, emphasizing the importance of mental health and limiting late-night screen exposure.Zambelli et al. evaluate the feasibility of delivering CBT-I through telehealth to chronic pain patients suffering from insomnia [25]. The study shows that adapted CBT-I delivered via telehealth not only improved sleep quality but also alleviated symptoms of anxiety, and depression. The research highlights the growing role of telehealth in making effective sleep interventions more accessible, particularly for populations with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.Telehealth-based interventions offer a scalable and practical solution to reach populations with limited access to in-person therapy. As healthcare systems continue to embrace digital health solutions, telehealth-based CBT-I can play a pivotal role in addressing sleep disorders, particularly in the post-pandemic era where telehealth has become more prominent.While the studies presented in this volume offer important insights, several areas remain unexplored, signaling opportunities for future research. First, the long-term effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions like PMR and CBT-I across diverse populations, including adolescents and the elderly, needs further investigation. Additionally, the impact of behavioral and lifestyle factors, such as mobile device use before bedtime, which has been shown to significantly influence sleep quality, particularly among younger populations, requires deeper examination.As telehealth becomes an increasingly central component of healthcare delivery, there is also a need to assess its broader efficacy across varying cultural contexts, socioeconomic groups, and medical conditions.Understanding how digital interventions like telehealth-delivered CBT-I can be optimized to meet the needs of different populations will be crucial for the equitable expansion of these services.The collection of research in this volume underscores the profound interconnectedness of sleep health and psychological well-being. From frontline healthcare workers grappling with anxiety during pandemics to chronic pain patients benefiting from telehealth-delivered CBT-I, these studies highlight the necessity of integrating sleep health into broader mental healthcare strategies. Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, despite their substantial repercussions on both individual and societal health.Psychologists play a crucial role in addressing sleep-related disorders, not only through therapeutic interventions such as CBT-I but also by promoting sleep hygiene and mental wellness as foundational elements of health. Academic training programs in psychology should emphasize the importance of sleep as a pillar of mental well-being, equipping future practitioners with the skills to recognize, address, and treat sleep disturbances as part of a comprehensive mental health approach.To advance a holistic approach, healthcare systems must prioritize early detection and treatment of sleep disorders, leveraging cross-disciplinary methods that integrate mental health, technology, and lifestyle interventions. This volume provides a robust foundation for understanding the significance of sleep in clinical practice, yet ongoing research and innovation will be essential to refine and expand these approaches, fostering a truly integrative model of mental healthcare that includes sleep as a central component.",

The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, polysomnography, and split-night studies: consensus statement of the Connecticut Thoracic Society and the Connecticut Neurological Society.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in childhood: a review.",
      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

      "title": "Stay awake! Understanding, diagnosing, and successfully managing narcolepsy.",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders can be intrinsic, as are insomnia or narcolepsy, or can be accounted for by external factors, such as noise, altitude, drug or alcohol abuse, or shift work. The arousal disorders, common in children, are usually benign and disappear by puberty. Sleep-wake transition disorders such as sleep starts are benign as well, and may occur at any age. The parasomnias comprise different entities such as nightmares, REM-sleep behavior disorder, sleep enuresis, and bruxism. Diagnosis and treatment often require a multidisciplinary approach. Virtually every psychiatric, neurologic, or medical disease, when of sufficient severity, leaves its specific fingerprint on sleep; some disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or epilepsy, tend to be exacerbated during sleep. Fortunately, most sleep disorders are amenable to therapy, which can include counseling, sleep hygiene, withholding of an offending agent, behavioral therapy, light therapy, or cautious drug therapy.",

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "title": "Rehabilitation or Recovery Sleep: A Future Potential Therapeutic Target for Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a period of relaxation and repair. During sleep, waste products of brain metabolism are removed. It plays central role in maintenance of physiological homeostasis and psychological balance. Sufficient sleep helps us think more clearly, complete complex tasks better and more consistently. One of the important function of sleep is to promote synaptic plasticity and neuronal recovery for proper brain functioning. Memory consolidation, brain growth and repair are other functions proposed for sleep. Problems related to sleep deprivation are being increased in today's modern society. Every day there seems to be twice as much work and half as much time to complete it, this results in a decrease in sleep or extended periods of wakefulness. Sleep deprived individuals may not have difficulty of verbal disturbances but research studies have shown that individuals have more difficulty in reacting well, to taking biological discussion and implementing the task with efficiency of action. Although day time performance due to sleep loss is experienced universally but in professionals such as paramilitary forces, army personals, who work under stressful conditions are more vulnerable to the sleep deprivation. These conditions become more stressful during emergencies and war because, after periods of extended wakefulness neurons may begin to malfunction, visibly affecting person's behavior. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays a role in learning due to an activation of the hippocampus involved in encoding new memories. Many experiments have shown that the day after a good night's sleep, one may retain newly acquired knowledge or a newly learned skill more effectively. An enriched environment (EE) which is a complex combination of social, cognitive, and physical stimulation, improves learning and memory. Many changes such as increased brain weight, synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, growth of dendritic spine as well as change in neurotransmitter content, up regulation of neuronal signaling molecules, neurotrophin levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been reported.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep physiology begins with development of the sleep/wake cycle, and the origins of active versus quiet sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle becomes established at 3-6 months. Sleep disorders during infancy commonly include mild, usually self-limited conditions such as sleep-onset association disorder, excessive nighttime feedings, and poor limit-setting. These require behavioral management to avoid long-term deleterious sleep habits. In contrast, other sleep disorders are more ominous, including SIDS, central congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and sleep apnea. Childhood is generally considered the golden age of sleep, with brief latency to sleep onset, high efficiency, and easy awakening. Yet parasomnias, psychological factors, and sleep disturbances associated with common disorders such as ADHD disrupt the idealistic notion of childhood being a period of unfettered sleep. Adolescents have sleep requirements similar to adults, posing a challenge for them to adapt to school schedules and increasingly demanding lifestyles. Narcolepsy, usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, is a lifelong sleep disorder and has led to the identification of the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmitter system. Research advances in the complex interrelationships between developmental neurobiology, sleep disorders and behavior will lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep problems and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for sleep disturbances in children.",

      "abstract": "Snoring usually is trivial and unimportant, but it can turn into a social or medical problem. Obesity, hypertension and heart disease are more frequent among snorers than among nonsnorers, and especially snorers with hypersomnia during the day are at risk. Hypersomnia in association with snoring usually signifies obstructive sleep apnea. Increased resistance in the upper airways, together with negative inspiratory pharyngeal pressure and muscular hypotonia during deep non-REM and REM sleep, lead to collapse of the pharynx, hypoxia and hypercapnia. Only after arousal from sleep does muscle tone return, pharyngeal obstruction reopen and airflow resume. Since this process can occur 300 or 400 times a night, repetitive alveolar hypoventilation leads to pulmonary-arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale, and the repetitive sympathetic activations can cause systemic hypertension or serious cardiac arrhythmias. The countless arousals deprive the sufferer of deep non-REM and REM sleep and their consequence is sleep fragmentation. The symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and personality and behavioral changes. Oronasomaxillofacial, endocrine and neuromuscular anomalies and diseases predispose to sleep apnea, and alcohol or CNS-depressant drugs can favour its occurrence. Diagnosis is made by nighttime oxymetry, and if this is abnormal, by polysomnography. After polysomnography it is possible to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive sleep apnea, and the decisions for an adequate treatment can be made.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "title": "Consequences of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Proneness to interpersonal conflict or depression",
      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) are reported to be among the most prevalent and unfavourable mental disorders in the individuals who have gone through life-threatening situations. For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

      "title": "Sleeping through the Ages: An Examination of Sleep in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "It is widely recognized that sleep disorders (SD) are highly prevalent, despite being under diagnosed and under treated in practice. SDs occurs at all ages, although presentation and subsequent consequences for an individual's health varies throughout the lifespan. Currently, evaluation of SDs are inadequate across all age ranges, and for both sexes, as they are compromised by under reporting and relying on self-report, rather than professional sleep studies (i.e., nocturnal polysomnography (NPS) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT)). Moreover, there is a paucity of data specific to the elderly; many older individuals report dissatisfaction with quality of sleep. Indeed, literature has shown that geriatric populations spend less time in slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and have more difficulties maintaining sleep. Their dissatisfaction may occur from changes in sleep architecture associated with the aging process; however, it has been suggested that it largely stems from comorbid illness, social problems, hormonal effects, altered circadian rhythms, or side effects of medications that are common in the elderly. Further, geriatric sleep is related to depression, impaired health and functioning, and weaker/ less synchronized circadian rhythms. In response, we utilized a 111-item questionnaire in conjunction with NPS, MSLT, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and medical chart reviews of individuals referred for SD evaluation to compare sleep in geriatrics with adults. Analysis revealed numerous differences between adult and geriatric groups, with the elderly experiencing more SDs, longer sleep latencies, and fewer sleep complaints. Based on the outcomes of this investigation, we posit further consideration to SDs across the age groups to achieve the best health care and quality of life for all.",

The depressed patient was found to dream as frequently as the nondepressed, but the dreams were shorter and had a paucity of traumatic or depressive content, even after the depression had lifted. A dream that awakens the dreamer in a terrified state generally with accompanying frightening dream content—a nightmare—would be a psychopathologic dream. The amount of information available from 20 publications would be woefully inadequate for characterizing the dreams of psychopathologic groups.",

Though metabolism slows during sleep, major organs and other regulatory functions continue. Sleep inertia can be thought of as that period of grogginess that is often experienced upon awakening. It is a transitional state between sleep and wake and is associated with lower arousal and performance levels. Sleep drive is a homeostatic process that is responsive to wake duration. The biological pressure for sleep builds over the wake period. Sleep loss can be categorized into three different types, depending on the length of the sleep loss and the magnitude of its effects: acute, cumulative and chronic. Fatigue and sleepiness can be used to describe a similar physiological state, although the use of fatigue is more prevalent in operational environments and sleepiness is more commonly used by sleep specialists. Maintaining optimal alertness and neurobehavioral functioning in operational environments is critical to maintaining safety, efficiency and success.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated.

      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

Changes at puberty halt the previous steady reduction of sleep during childhood. Adolescence may bring particular sleep problems such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), which is common in teenagers. Late-night social or other activities make it physiologically impossible to get to sleep, leading to insufficient sleep and sleep debt which, if unrecognised or incorrectly diagnosed and left untreated, may cause daytime sleepiness and underfunctioning.

      "abstract": "【With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.】",

Themes of death and/or dying, and to a lesser extent, themes of violence, injury, and/or murder occurred with greater frequency in the dream reports of depressed patients with suicidal ideation and/or attempts, than in the dream reports of depressed patients without suicidal ideation or behavior.

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation.

      "title": "Public health and insomnia: economic impact.",
      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in childhood are frequent and usually harmless. They rarely point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders, it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g. psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).",

It is rare to remember a smell or a taste from the dream. Reading and computations (arithmetic) do not frequently occur in dreams. Many dreams contain unusual amounts of emotion, and may provide greater access to older memories – -especially during late morning REM dreams. While impairment in critical self-reflective capacities may occur in dreams, it is not clear if all dreams are characterized by impairment in self-reflectiveness. The dreaming mind/brain spontaneously and automatically produces dreams in the form of narratives and likely uses cognitive operations like Freud's dreamwork to do so.",

As the patient matures into adult, sleep disorders continue to be common and an important factor in development, both social and cognitive. Sleep disorders can adversely impact physical and mental health. Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child's ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

      "title": "Insomnia: definition, prevalence, health risks and therapy approaches",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common disorder among the general population, which has a chronic course and a heavy burden on patients and the health care system. Epidemiological papers on sleep disorders show that a large number of people complain of sleep disorders. Today, there are several classifications and definitions for sleep disorders, and first of all for insomnia. Insufficient sleep can contribute to the occurrence of rapid fatigue during the daytime, reduced activity, attention and efficiency. Studies have shown that long-term and severe sleep disorders can lead to and/or exacerbate various somatic, neurological and mental diseases. Insomnia can contribute to cognitive impairment. Although both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available, drugs are more often prescribed due to greater availability. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first line treatment for adults of any age. Pharmacological intervention may be offered, if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not enough effective or not available. At the same time, the pharmacotherapy for sleep disorders remains problematic despite a large number of sleeping pills. Sleeping agents that are widely used in medical practice both in terms of their mechanisms of action and final results such as their effect on sleep do not always contribute to the development of natural (or at least close to physiological) sleep. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin, and phytotherapeutic medicines can be used to treat insomnia.",

In addition, various factors can negatively affect sleep after spinal cord injury, including pain, insomnia, and/or the circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders. Subsequently, people with spinal cord injuries report daytime symptoms such as fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficult concentration, and impaired quality of life.

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder - past, present, and future",
      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

      "abstract": "Illness anxiety disorder (previously called hypochondriasis, a term which has been revised in the DSM-5 due to its disparaging connotation) is a psychiatric disorder defined by excessive worry about having or developing a serious undiagnosed medical condition. People with an illness anxiety disorder (IAD) experience persistent anxiety or fear of developing or having a serious medical illness that adversely affects their daily life. This fear persists despite normal physical examination and laboratory testing results. People suffering from IAD pay excessive attention to normal bodily sensations (such as functions of digestion or sweating) and misinterpret these sensations as indicators of severe disease. IAD is typically a chronic condition.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "title": "Sleep: universal for all, problematic for some",
      "abstract": "Human sleep is a paradox that evades detailed understanding to a large extent. Despite the fact people sleep almost every night, and despite advances in the scientific understanding of sleep, most of us have no insight or even a basic understanding of what happens when we sleep. Poor sleep, or a perception of poor sleep, vexes many. Insomnia or sleep disturbance is a very common presentation in primary care, and the effect of insomnia may be trivialised, to some degree, in the primary care setting, contributing to a lack of support and a dearth of clear management guidelines.1 An understanding of sleep and sleep requirements across the human life cycle remains elusive. As the parents of a newborn child can often attest, babies usually need to sleep a lot, but it is relatively uncommon for the infant's sleep cycle to align with that of the parents. Conversely, older people often perceive that their sleep is poor, and up to 50% of older people complain about difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.2 Although normal aging processes can account for some of that insomnia, medical or psychiatric diseases, including chronic pain, dementia, depression, sleep-disordered breathing and more, can also have a profound impact. In this edition of the Journal we see discussion of this important clinical issue in detail. The reality is that there are a good many drugs in the pharmacopoeia that have sedating properties, and generally these agents, when given at an adequate dose, will cause an older person to fall asleep. It is another question altogether as to whether that person will remain asleep for the desired duration of rest, whether the sleep achieved will be of good quality and will fulfil the physiological purposes required, or whether the medications will continue to work if administered on a longer-term basis. Moreover, by the time a healthcare professional of any discipline has completed their basic training and enters the workforce, it is virtually impossible not to have been comprehensively appraised of the potential adverse consequences of the use of hypnosedatives in the context of advanced age. Equally, it is well-nigh inconceivable not to have been thoroughly exposed to the worthy concept of dealing with sleep disturbance (particularly among older people) by addressing underlying causes. On this basis, it is really not plausible to argue that ignorance of some of the issues involved on the part of doctors, pharmacists and nurses is driving the persistent use of these medicines among older people. Epidemiologists, academics and even social commentators with no qualifications at all are building reputations and social media profiles from being the dispensers of wisdom about the inadvisability of resorting to drugs to address insomnia among the elderly, and who could blame them? Prima facie, it would appear almost impossible to advocate otherwise. Of course, were the matter to be as simple as is presented by some, there would be no older people with insomnia: all the underlying causes would be adroitly addressed, and our older generations would have sound and satisfying sleep of adequate duration every night; but this is very clearly not the case. The reality is that many of the underlying causes of sleep disturbance for older people are refractory to intervention, severe, progressive and, in some cases, irreversible. In one's seventh, eighth and ninth decades of life, sleep may not come as easily as it does to one in the flush of youth, but if the underlying causes cannot be remediated, should this be the basis to suggest that these older people should be consigned to endure sleep disturbance for the rest of their relatively brief time on the planet? The possible downside of pharmacotherapy for sleep disturbances affecting older people is a concept not lost upon any discerning clinician. There has recently been a huge raft of attention focusing upon the prescribing rates of sedating medications in settings like aged and extended care facilities. For example, the RedUSe study, well-designed and conducted with rigour, conclusively demonstrated that the proportion of residents in aged care facilities prescribed antipsychotics and benzodiazepines can be reduced by the implementation of a multifaceted intervention.3 The nuances can be debated ad infinitum, but the fact remains that although the intervention reduced the prescribing of a potentially hazardous group of drugs, the long-term outcomes (both clinical and economic) associated with doing so were not assessed. Proponents will point to the prevention of possible harm associated with a higher rate of usage were the intervention not implemented, but of course, in the absence of measurement of long-term clinical outcomes, we cannot be sure. In the meantime, other parameters that escaped measurement included those related to quality of life, injuries that may arise because of agitated behaviour and consumer preference. There can be no denying that hypnosedatives and other psychotropic drugs have the potential to cause harm for older people but, like the case for other clinical situations, both sides of the equation warrant consideration. There are dozens of examples of widely used drugs with serious adverse effects that are more common among the elderly, but it is of interest that hypnosedatives have been singled out for special attention. Like the starting position established for the construct of the RedUSe study, the respected Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults4 make it very clear that the learned consensus panel assembled to determine the ratings considers that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics should be avoided for older people if possible. By contrast, the guidance provided in relation to anticoagulants is less strongly worded than for benzodiazepines – an interesting observation, given that on the basis of per capita usage rates, it could be argued that the former drugs create more iatrogenic harm for the elderly than the latter. To be clear, this point is not made here to argue that hypnosedatives or anticoagulants should be either used or avoided for older people: that is a matter for much wiser people than this commentator. However, it is reasonable to point out that there appears to be a kind of societal overlay applied in the consideration of medicines used for sleep. It is interesting to consider that the people who publish guidance and provide commentary about what is and is not appropriate in terms of the medicines prescribed to assist older people with sleep are almost always younger people, yet to experience the decline in sleep quality and duration that often accompanies older age, but as Joni Mitchell once sang, ‘you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone’. As is the case for all medicines, it is important that the use of hypnosedatives for older people is guided with a conservative hand intent on averting avoidable harm; but, at the same time, it is also important not to dismiss the importance of a good night's rest. An Irish proverb suggests that ‘a good laugh and a long sleep are the best cures in the doctor's book’. Perhaps that prescription may be written more often? The author declares that he has no conflicts of interest.",

Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common. Narcolepsy is a primary EDS disorder affecting about 0.05% of the population. EDS is also often secondary to a severe insomnia associated with obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "abstract": "Undisturbed sleep of sufficient length is essential for daytime alertness and performance, health and wellbeing. According to recent figures published by the WHO, sleep disturbance is one of the most deleterious non-auditory effects of environmental noise. A connection between noise exposure in the residential setting and detrimental effects on sleep and health is suggested by observational, experimental and epidemiological evidence that has been accumulated over the last decades. Maximum sound pressure levels as low as 33 dB have been shown to induce physiological reactions such as autonomic, motor, and cortical arousals (e.g., tachycardia, body movements, awakenings). Whether or not noise will induce such acute effects depends on the number of noise events and their acoustical properties, but also on situational moderators (e.g. momentary sleep stage) and individual noise sensitivity. Although clinical sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) have been shown to be associated with increased risks for cardiovascular diseases, only little is known about long-term effects of noise-disturbed sleep on cardiovascular health. In the past years, several hints have surfaced that undermine the suspicion that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of long term effects than daytime noise exposure. The paper reviews the present state of research in the domain of noise-induced sleep disturbances from transportation and other noise sources, compares exposure-effect functions, critically appraises methods for the assessment of noise effects on sleep, and reviews potential mechanisms of the genesis of long term health effects due to noise-induced sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

      "abstract": "Depression and Anxiety Disorder in Children and AdolescentsDepression and anxiety are common in children and indicate a problem with mood or anxiety processing.Everyone has moods and fears.Some people have intense moods or feelings that interfere with their lives in their family, with peers, at school, and in play.Importantly, both depression and anxiety disorders can be treated.Depression is mostly a problem of moods.Sadness or irritability are the core symptoms, and thinking, sleeping, eating, and energy are also affected.Anxiety disorders are difficulties with worries or fears that make it hard for a child to participate in their day-to-day life.Extreme fears can focus on specific types of situations, such as social situations or being away from parents, or can be generalized about almost anything.Anxiety can also include panic attacks with rapid heartbeat or trouble breathing.Depression and anxiety can cause difficulties with sleeping, thinking, or managing frustration.It is common for anxiety or depression to first be noticed with disruptive behaviors such as trouble with rules, talking back, or tantrums.Depression and anxiety disorders can develop in children at any age, from preschool through adolescence.A combination of life experiences, inherited genes, and other factors influence who develops anxiety or depression and when.While depression and anxiety are more likely to develop in stressful situations or run in families, both can develop any time and in anyone.During the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of anxiety and depression have doubled, with depression rising to 1 in 4 children and youth and problematic anxiety to 1 in 5. Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Parasomnias Hrayr Attarian1* 1 Loyola University Health System, Department of Neurology, United States Learning objectives: Recognize the major categories of parasomnias Know the clinical presentations of the common parasomnias Understand the treatment options available Parasomnias are undesirable physical or experiential events that occur in and around sleep and although most of them are benign they can, occasionally, lead to significant morbidity primarily through injury to self or bed partners. They remain poorly recognized and understood. They fall under 3 categories; \"NREM parasomnias\", \"REM parasomnias\" and \"Other parasomnias\". Sleepwalking, sleep terrors and confusional arousals constitute the first category. The key differentiating characteristic of sleepwalking is the extensive wandering, of sleep terrors the autonomic hyperarousal and of confusional arousal the complex behaviors and sluggish response to the environment. There is a degree of overlap among all three. Among the REM parasomnias the most common is nightmares and the most injurious REM sleep behavior disorder or RBD. Nightmares are anxiety and fear provoking recurrent dreams and most do not require treatment but of those that do tend to respond to cognitive therapy low dose prazosin, an alpha 1 antagonist. RBD is a condition where the normal atonia of REM is absent and patients tend to act out their dreams hence risking injury to self or bed partner. This condition can be idiopathic but may also be related to neurodegenerative disorders, other sleep disorders or secondary to exposure to antidepressant medication. Treatment is generally successful with either clonazepam or high dose melatonin. The category of other parasomnias comprises of conditions that are not state dependant. Catathrenia or nocturnal groaning is such a condition that although benign can lead to significant sleep disruption and social embarrassment. It usually responds to CPAP even in the absence of sleep related breathing disorder. Sleep related eating disorder is another such parasomnia which can lead to injury, obesity and other adverse health outcomes. The treatment of choice is usually topiramate although pramipexole and SSRIs have been shown effective as well.

      "abstract": "Fear is one of the four primary emotions. It represents an inborn defence mechanism as a kind of protection from different potential dangers, and it manifests on a physical, cognitive and behavioural level. Physically it shows through faster heart beat, redness, heavier breathing, sweating, muscle tension, etc. On a cognitive level it can manifestin form of forgetfulness, concentration difficulty, negative thoughts, self-consciousness, etc. In terms of behaviour it becomes apparent through crying and screaming, teeth chattering and lip twitching, stuttering, thumb sucking, etc. Fear occurs in the second half of the child’s first year, and according to available research, younger children and girls experience a bigger number of fears than older children and boys. We can commonly see developmental fears in children, what is a normal occurrence at a certain age. They occur, change and spontaneously disappear when a child outgrows a certain developmental phase. During every developmental phase there are specific fears that have a certain function for that age. Children can be afraid of unknown people, separation, darkness and imaginary creatures, injuries, catastrophes, failure, lack of acceptance, ridicule, etc. Although developmental fears usually pass by themselves, and are an integral part to a child’s development, they can become intense and lasting so that they interfere with the child’s everyday life. In those cases expert help is needed. Fears in children can be a result of crisis situations, such as illness or hospitalisation of the child, illness of family members, divorce of the parents, death of family members, violence in the family and abuse in the family. Traumatised children generally suffer from more visible fears and tension and often expert help is necessary.",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders. So its a demand of time to know about the real sleep and the disturbed sleep according to Ayurveda and Mordern medicines also and effect of Taila Dhara Brahmi,Jatamamsi siddha) in treating Insomnia.",

The term somnolence describes a drowsy patient who responds to mild stimulus (such as voice), and mumbles incoherently and moves in a disorganized fashion. In contrast, a stuporous patient responds to a vigorous and continuous stimulus only, and upon discontinuation of a stimulus returns to an unresponsive state. Coma is a state of complete unresponsiveness, from which a patient cannot be aroused.",

Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes.

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well.

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

      "title": "Ask About Daytime Sleepiness!",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is being recognized increasingly as a significant public health problem.1 Sleep loss or inadequate sleep time is the most common cause of EDS in the general population.1–3 Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and periodic leg movements in sleep are prevalent, particularly among older persons, and can contribute to EDS.4 Other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, psychiatric illness, chronic pain syndromes, and several neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders, can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. Moreover, widely prescribed medications, including diuretics, antihypertensives, sympathomimetic agents, corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, and certain antidepressants, can cause EDS by interfering with sleep continuity and/or by having a direct sedating effect in the daytime. The adverse consequences of EDS are numerous. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hypersomnolence is associated with neurocognitive deficits, including decrements in attention, vigilance, and memory.5 Evidence also supports a strong association between EDS and an increased risk for domestic, work-related, and motor vehicle accidents.6,7 Impaired general health status and limitations in activities of daily living are yet other common sequela.8,9 Furthermore, landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Honolulu Heart Program and the Cardiovascular Health Study have associated EDS with a higher prevalence of heart disease, congestive heart failure, and dementia.10,11 The important report by Newman et al. in this issue extends our understanding by documenting an independent association between EDS and incident cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the gender differences noted in the current investigation are consistent with previous reports of the high prevalence of sleep complaints among women and with the association of sleep disordered breathing with increased mortality in women in the nursing home setting.12 The causal pathway between EDS and morbid events, including cognitive dysfunction, accidents, and impaired quality of life, is readily envisioned. The occurrence of brief “microsleeps” and even prolonged sleep episodes in the daytime can decrease vigilance and lead to compromised performance at home, work, or during safety-sensitive tasks such as driving. Moreover, the inability to maintain wakefulness during the day can have a deleterious influence on social functioning and can lower one's sense of well-being. See also p 115 Yet unresolved, however, are the mechanisms through which EDS relates independently to cardiovascular end-points and mortality. At least three different causal pathways are proposed. First, it is possible that the increased morbidity and mortality associated with EDS are a function of underlying sleep disorders that cause EDS. It is well established that sleep-disordered breathing is prevalent in the general population. In middle-aged adults the prevalence is estimated to be at least 2 to 4%, and in certain subgroups it may be much higher.13 Several investigators have shown that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing increases with age, with estimates that perhaps 30 to 40% of older individuals may have this chronic disorder.12,14,15 Recent work indicates that the frequency of disordered breathing events, severity of associated oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and degree of sleep fragmentation contribute independently to the occurrence of EDS.16 Clinic- and population-based studies have also shown an association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension and prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of the effects of age, gender, smoking, and obesity.17 Therefore, in this setting, morbidity and mortality caused by EDS reflect underlying primary sleep disorders that are, in turn, associated with cardiovascular end-points and mortality. Second, many of the chronic medical conditions that are prevalent in older people, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, and depression, can be related indirectly to EDS through their interference with nocturnal sleep quality. It is now appreciated that congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can predispose to sleep-disordered breathing, which can potentially exacerbate the predisposing condition.18,19 As with the occurrence of a primary sleep disorder, EDS in this setting is merely a surrogate marker for these chronic ailments, Third, it is possible that EDS has a direct role, through an undefined mechanism, in increasing morbidity and mortality, independent of either underlying primary sleep disorders or other recognized chronic medical illnesses. Experimental sleep deprivation studies in normal volunteers demonstrate a heightened sympathetic drive with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.20,21 Extensive data indicate that sleep deprivation is also linked with significant alterations in the neuroendocrine axis characterized by an increase in serum Cortisol levels and a slower rate of daylong decline following the early morning circadian elevation.21,22 In the context of multiple chronic illnesses that are common among older adults, such neurohumoral alterations can increase further the probability of precipitating adverse events and require further delineation. Daytime sleepiness is assessed either objectively or subjectively. Objective methods include the multiple sleep latency test and the maintenance of wakefulness test.21–24 The former is used commonly in the clinical setting and many consider it to be the gold standard for the assessment of sleepiness. Subjective methods utilize self-report to identify sleep propensity and include validated questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.24,25 Since patients often underestimate their own degree of sleepiness, validated questionnaires addressing the likelihood of feeling drowsy or falling asleep during specific activities are more effective than general inquiries regarding the presence or absence of EDS. Moreover, questions about specific sleep-wake habits and input from family members, bed partners, and/or caregivers can provide a more accurate estimate of the degree and functional impact of EDS. In their study, Newman et al. use a general inquiry for identifying sleep-related problems and daytime sleepiness, raising the possibility of some degree of misclassification in their exposure variable (i.e., daytime sleepiness). In another recent prospective population-based study, the presence of self-reported snoring and general EDS was associated with total death rate and cardiovascular mortality. This effect was age-dependent and persisted after adjustment for body mass index, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, isolated snoring or hypersomnolence were not associated with increased mortality.26 In each of these investigations, the use of validated questionnaires to assess EDS and information regarding the presence of documented sleep-related disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) would have been invaluable in examining the true independent effect of EDS on cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause mortality and the pathogenesis of this relationship. Newer initiatives sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have addressed some of the limitations of these important initial studies. The Sleep Heart Health Study, a multi-site longitudinal cohort study, is investigating the links between sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular endpoints.27 Until such prospective data clarify these relationships, we believe that currently available evidence supports the simple, noninvasive measure of asking our patients about their sleep and, in particular, about the presence of inappropriate hypersomnolence. All healthcare professionals have an important role in recognizing EDS as a sign and symptom that is amenable to effective treatment, The time-honored notion that somnolence is an expected (and accepted) concomitant of normal aging requires reevaluation: EDS that intrudes on daytime function not only compromises the quality of life but may also threaten lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of primary and secondary sleep problems among older persons, health professionals have often not prioritized the sleep history essential to recognition of potentially treatable conditions, and an important opportunity for health promotion is lost.28 We can and must do better.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu.

Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep problem affecting nearly one-third of the population as either a primary or comorbid condition. Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level. Clinicians in either primary settings or specialized clinics should have knowledge to manage insomnia with confidence.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.

Examples include bruxism, nocturnal leg cramps, and sleep starts. These movements need to be distinguished from more complex motor activities which are called parasomnias, such as REM sleep behavior disorder or sleepwalking. This distinction can typically be accomplished by taking a detailed history and physical, but may require the use of in-laboratory, attended polysomnography. Commonly included in the classification of sleep-related movement disorders is restless legs syndrome, which, though a complex activity, is frequently associated with periodic limb movements of sleep which more clearly fit the description of a sleep-related movement disorder. Restless legs syndrome is a common, yet frequently missed, cause of sleep disruption in the population. Effective and safe treatments, such as dopamine agonists, exist for this condition.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

Disorders of arousal include confusional arousal, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Research into the pathogenesis of arousal disorders in adults suggests that they reflect aberrant slow-wave sleep regulation, impaired arousal specifically from NREM 3 sleep, and/or sleep/wake state dissociations. Treatment of DoA includes avoidance of sleep deprivation/restriction, irregular sleep/wake schedules, and predisposing/precipitating factors. Pharmacotherapy can be considered when events pose a danger and/or sleep disturbance to the patient and/or others; involve potentially violent, dangerous, or sexual behavior; are frequent, chronic, and refractory to initial therapies; and/or have secondary consequences such as excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired quality of life, excessive weight gain, and injuries.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

      "abstract": "Neurologists are often enlisted to help diagnose, evaluate, and manage a spectrum of abnormal spells during the night ranging from parasomnias to motor disturbance that span the sleep-wake cycle. Parasomnias are undesirable emotional or physical events that accompany sleep. These events typically occur during entry into sleep from wakefulness, or during arousals from sleep, and are often augmented by the sleep state. Some parasomnias, such as the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder may be extremely undesirable, while others such as somniloquy are often of little concern. The parasomnias include a spectrum of abnormal emotions, movements, behaviors, sensory perceptions, dream mentation, and autonomic activity. Basic physiologic drives, such as sex, hunger, and aggression, may manifest as sleep-related eating, sleep-related sexual behaviors, and sleep-related violence. Parasomnias have a very bizarre nature, but are readily explainable, diagnosable, and treatable. They are hypothesized to be due to changes in brain organization across multiple states of being, and are particularly apt to occur during the incomplete transition or oscillation from one sleep state to another. Parasomnias are often explained on the basis that wakefulness and sleep are not mutually exclusive states, and abnormal intrusion of wakefulness into non-REM (NREM) sleep produces arousal disorders, and intrusion of wakefulness into REM sleep produces REM sleep parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), two closely related conditions that often result in disturbed sleep onset and sleep maintenance, are also reviewed in this article. Although the mechanisms that underlie idiopathic RLS or PLMD are not fully understood, there is currently substantial evidence that dopaminergic dysfunction is likely involved in both conditions. The discussion will conclude with the \"other parasomnias\" and sleep-related movement disorders of clinical interest to the neurologist.",

The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

Some parasomnias, such as sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations, are part of the classic tetrad of narcolepsy, but are encountered as isolated phenomena in an extremely high proportion of the otherwise normal population. Others are much less commonly experienced or encountered, but a knowledge of these conditions often permits a rapid diagnosis. This chapter discusses a range of other parasomnias that may occasionally be encountered in clinical practice, including rhythmic movement disorder, hypnic jerks, exploding head syndrome and propriospinal myoclonus.",

      "abstract": "In presenting a case of extreme hyposomnia, psychosomatic insomnia is elaborated as a special type of primary insomnia. The case study of a 60 years old man is based on psychiatric examinations, an intersive one-week observation including polygraphic sleep recordings, and on reviewing medical data over a period of 35 years. In this case, the insomnia developed during a life situation with social stress and continued over 30 years with a gradual sleep reduction to 2-4 hours. Our sleep recordings confirmed a total sleep time of nearly 3 hours, a marked rhythmicity of sleep and day-time activities, fragmentation of sleep, and psychogenic extrasystoles, all symptoms having been reported by the subject previously. Autonomic functions indicated a good efficiency of NREM sleep, whereas a first night effect with subsequent adaptation revealed a good regulatory function of the sleep-waking-system. In addition to a detailed documentation of this extraordinary case, an interpretation is undertaken in order to explain, how the insomnia developed and continued. Psychodynamic aspects show a set of characteristics which are most typical for psychosomatic syndroms. The authors expect, that the knowledge about psychosomatic insomnia will be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of severe insomnias.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children's sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child's period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

The main therapeutic resources at present include antidepressants, selected benzodiazepines and behavioral treatments and are very successful in improving panic attacks and their consequences, which may long go undiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are common across the lifespan. This article describes the manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-REM parasomnias in adults and discusses the social implications of these conditions.Non-REM parasomnias represent a hybrid state of wakefulness and sleep, often triggered by events that increase the frequency of arousals or make it more difficult to fully arouse from sleep. Sleep deprivation, certain medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea are known to provoke parasomnias, particularly in those who are genetically predisposed. Non-REM parasomnias include disorders of arousal (ie, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals), sleep-related eating disorder, and exploding head syndrome. Clinical overlap exists between sleep-related eating disorder and disorders of arousal, suggesting that sleep-related eating disorder may be a fourth disorder of arousal or a manifestation of sleepwalking. Exploding head syndrome is a unique parasomnia of uncertain etiology.Non-REM parasomnias can range from minor nuisances to severe, life-altering events. While some patients with non-REM parasomnia experience significant consequences during sleep, wakefulness, or both, non-REM parasomnias do not pose a major risk to most patients. For all patients with non-REM parasomnias, safety should be explicitly discussed and addressed. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be prioritized, as increasing total sleep time, avoiding triggering substances, and treating comorbid sleep disorders is often sufficient for the management of non-REM parasomnias. If symptoms persist despite these interventions, treatment with clonazepam or other medications can be considered.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most prevalent breathing disturbance during sleep [1], affecting 2% to 6% of the general population, depending on age, sex, and the defi nition of criteria [2]. An estimated 82% of men and 92% of women with moderate to severe OSA have not been diagnosed [3]. Sleep apnea events are defi ned as a complete cessation of breathing (apnea) or a marked reduction in airfl ow (hypopnea) during sleep, and are considered clinically relevant if they last more than 10 seconds. The episodes of apneas and hypopneas may persist for 30 to 60 seconds in some individuals. OSA is characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway, often resulting in oxygen desaturation and arousals from sleep. The classic daytime manifestation is excessive sleepiness, and other symptoms such as non-refreshing sleep, poor concentration, and fatigue are commonly reported [4]. OSA is a serious condition that diminishes the quality of life [5] and is also associated with many common comorbidities. Studies have documented an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and gastroesophageal refl ux disease in OSA patients [6,7]. It is estimated that the average life span of an untreated OSA patient is 58 years, much shorter than the average life spans of 78 years for men and 83 years for women [8]. The signs and symptoms of OSA are shown in Table 1.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "title": "Is ‘Poor Sleep’ Too Vague a Concept for Rational Treatment?",
      "abstract": "Poor sleep is a common complaint, accounting for 4-5% of all general practitioner consultations. Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation. Zolpidem (an imidazoypridine), one such agent, seems to provide an effective treatment for insomnia without inducing undesirable side-effects.",

Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them.

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

Underlying sleep disorders are aggravated due to a decrease in the ability to get needed sleep. However, the decreased ability is less a function of age and more a function of other factors that accompany aging, such as medical and psychiatric illness, increased medication use, advances in the endogenous circadian clock and a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders.",

The health care of the stroke victim is direct on the revealing and activity on the risk factors of the stroke and also on the caring of the other abilities after the stroke and also on the capability, in the first place, for the activities of the self care and then on the satisfaction of the other human needs. Application of the process of the nursing care, we can achieve systematic and documented monitoring of the nursing care of stroke victim. In this work, it's shortly presented the confirmation of the needs for the nursing care, planning, leading and evaluation of the nursing care with an accent on the specifics of the nursing care of the stroke victim.",

      "abstract": "#### The bottom line\n\nDelusional infestation (previously also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom’s syndrome) is a rare disorder, but it commonly poses disproportionate practical problems to healthcare systems.1 It is characterised by a patient’s fixed belief that his or her skin, body, or immediate environment is infested by small, living (or less often inanimate) pathogens despite the lack of any medical evidence for this.1 Delusional infestation is neither a single disease nor a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "title": "Sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness of sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders. Most of the sleep disturbances in neuromuscular disorders are secondary to sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is commonly associated with a slowly developing chronic respiratory failure, particularly in the advanced stages, but the condition often remains unrecognized and untreated. The most common sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is sleep-related hypoventilation which initially manifests during REM sleep and later as the disease advances, it is also noted during non-REM sleep and even during daytime. In addition to the hypoventilation, central and upper airway obstructive apneas as well as hypopneas occur. Hypoventilation during sleep gives rise to hypoxemia and hypercapnea causing chronic respiratory failure. The abnormal blood gases may later persist during the daytime. Some patients may, however, have sleep onset or maintenance insomnia as a result of associated pain, muscle immobility, contractures, joint pains and muscle cramps as well as anxiety and depression.The commonest complaint in patients with neuromuscular disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing is excessive daytime somnolence as a result of repeated arousals and sleep fragmentation due to sleep hypoventilation and transient nocturnal hypoxemia. Sleep-disordered breathing causing sleep disturbance is well known in patients with poliomyelitis, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, primary muscle disorders including muscular dystrophies and myotonic dystrophy, congenital or acquired myopathies, neuromuscular junctional disorders and polyneuropathies. All of these conditions may cause weakness of the diaphragm, the intercostal and accessory muscles of respiration causing breathlessness and other respiratory dysrhythmias. As a result of the respiratory and upper airway muscle weakness, the normal sleep-related respiratory physiologic vulnerability becomes pathological in these patients with neuro-muscular disorders causing hypoventilation or central and upper airway obstructive apneas during sleep. Multiple factors are responsible for sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders causing sleep hypoventilation and other respiratory dysrhythmias, and these include: impaired chest bellows, increased work of breathing, hypo-responsive respiratory chemoreceptors, increased upper airway resistance, decreased minute and alveolar ventilation, REM-related marked hypotonia or atonia of the respiratory muscles except the diaphragm, respiratory muscle fatigue and kyphoscoliosis secondary to neuromuscular disorders causing extrapulmonary restriction of the lungs. Nocturnal hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disorders may present insidiously and initially may remain asymptomatic. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed. Clinical clues suggesting sleep-disordered breathing include daytime hypersomnolence, breathlessness, disturbed nocturnal sleep and unexplained leg edema. If the clinical clues strongly suggest sleep-disordered breathing, a physical examination must be directed to uncover bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders showing these clinical features must be investigated to uncover nocturnal hypoventilation to prevent serious consequences of chronic.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

Notable among these is REM sleep behavior disorder, which is closely linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. Early detection of this disorder is essential because it often precedes the motor symptoms of neurodegenerative conditions.

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

These are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBD); restless legs syndrome; periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS); cataplexy, which manifests itself as sudden falling, head dropping, or jaw dropping due to sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions (laughing in particular); hypnic jerks or hypnagogic myoclonus; fragmentary myoclonus in children; autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy; sleep walking and sleep terrors; head banging, and bruxism (grinding of the teeth). Careful history taking or reviewing a home video provides valuable clues, but the gold standard remains video polysomnography (PSG). Some sleep-related movements do not represent “disorders” as such but are harmless, physiological motor phenomena, and are discussed because of their frequency and relevance in differential diagnostic considerations.",

      "title": "Physiological and psychological factors in sleep-onset insomnia.",
      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

In the acute post-concussion state, it is common to feel irritable, more emotional, and to have difficulty falling asleep, which are non-specific symptoms commonly observed in anxiety disorders. Concussion injuries sometimes occur in a psychically charged environment, which may potentiate acute anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These disorders can then potentiate prolonged post-concussion persistent symptoms. It is important to differentiate between post-concussion anxiety symptoms and the development of an anxiety disorder. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management, as needed, should address the specific anxiety manifestations.",

The main differential diagnosis of parasomnias are the nocturnal epilepsies, which may require video electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment if suspected. Night terrors The child will appear afraid, inconsolable, and often moaning or whimpering repetitively. They will usually be either unresponsive or only partially responsive to attempts to intervene or communicate. Characteristically, the child will remember nothing of the event in the morning.

Deprivation studies are one of the ways used to examine the physiological functions and the regulation of the sleep. Sleep deprivation is a stressor, and its’ effects depend on an individual’s prior sleep deficit and distribution during the day. Sleep deprivation can be partial, total, acute, or chronic or specifically focused on one of the sleep phases. Sleep deprivation affects a large spectrum of vital systems such as thermoregulation, energy and mineral balance, and immunofunction. Based on the fact that sleep is a very important process for the normal development of many metabolic pathways, it is logical to think that insomnia has serious organism consequences. Functional irregularities of different organs are always reflected in structural changes that can be identified with imaging techniques. Imaging methods can also help identify problems of animals insomnia.",

The misalignment between the internal circadian timing system and the external environment is typically due to either an alteration in the functioning of the circadian timing system (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome) or to changes in the external environment (e.g., jet lag). However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is required to develop more effective treatments.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a widespread disorder affecting not only sleep quantity and quality, but also daytime well-being and performance, as well as having a negative impact on physical and mental health. Many people have problems falling asleep and maintaining sleep that do not reach the clinical criteria of insomnia. For all the prevalence of such sleep disorders, specialists often overlook a fundamentally important factor that affects sleep and wakefulness cycle, ease of falling asleep and daytime performance. These are circadian rhythms of the body under the control of the biological clock.This review highlights the specifics of the human biological clock and its relationship to insomnia and complaints of poor sleep. The phenomenon of the human chronotype as a set of individual preferences in sleep-wake rhythm is considered. Late chronotype, tat tends to wake up late and be active in the evening turns out to be the most vulnerable to the appearance of complaints of poor sleep and development of insomnia. This result is typical for different age groups. The reason for problems sleep for the late chronotype is the need to adjust to social demands and to fall asleep and wake up too early relative to the phase of one’s own circadian rhythm.Circadian rhythms may contribute to the formation and maintenance of insomnia. Both chronic and acute insomnia may have a chronobiological component that is not always considered. Late chronotype may be a factor further exacerbating the course of insomnia. The regularity of circadian rhythms may also be impaired in insomnia.The importance of the biological clock in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness also explains the successful approach to insomnia treatment with melatonin, which plays an important signaling role in the circadian regulation of the body.",

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is the main cause of disability among psychiatric disorders worldwide. This surprisingly high burden is related to its high prevalence and its severity. Indeed, depression is often comorbid with somatic as well as psychiatric disorders (particularly suicide, anxiety, and substances), and response to antidepressants is only seen in a minority of patients. Other issues related to the difficulties of treating these patients are the frequency of residual symptoms (mood, fatigue, sleep or appetite disorders) that have been associated with relapses and recurrences. Furthermore, emotional regulation during euthymic periods may be viewed as predictive of subsequent intensity of depressive symptoms. Treatment of depression is a major challenge in daily practice, and researchers need to propose more effective treatments based on innovative approaches. The cyclic nature of depressive illness, the diurnal variations in its symptomatology, and the existence of disturbed sleep-wake and core body temperature rhythms all suggest that dysfunction of the circadian time-keeping system may underlie the pathophysiology of depression. Circadian misalignment of the phase-delayed type appears to be the common shift in unipolar depression and, interestingly, the misalignment between the timing of sleep and the pacemaker is correlated with depressive symptom severity. So, as circadian rhythm disturbances are at the core of depression, their normalizing may be a fruitful avenue for new therapeutic targets in depression.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga.

There are many potential causes of transient distress in palliative care, including insensitive comments, long waits in clinical departments, and disease symptoms. Such potential causes of distress should be an important focus of attention in everyday nursing practice, because the disruption and worry they cause is often unnecessary. The wish to continue living is a potent life force that is present in most people until the moment of death, and fear of death grows as death approaches. Antianxiety medication with long-acting benzodiazepines or antidepressants can also be helpful for very distressed people. Many nurses also feel they have little time to assess and address people's concerns comprehensively.",

One of the important developments in the modern understanding of DDs is the establishment of a clearer link between trauma and dissociation. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\". The symptoms of depersonalization and/or derealization frequently co-occur in a variety of other psychiatric disorders, primarily in patients with anxiety disorders.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "title": "Insomnia disorder: State of the science and challenges for the future",
      "abstract": "Summary Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self‐report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive‐behavioural models to (epi‐) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep–wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive‐behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first‐line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive‐behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non‐response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global burden of mental disorders.",

The clinical manifestations were characterized by peculiar emotional disorders, polymorphous autonomic and vascular shifts. These states occurred in the majority of cases after some somatic diseases in conjunction with other physical or psychological stresses in individuals with anxiety traits and 'neurocirculatory asthenia'. The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions. Subsequently dysphoric mood, somatic concerns, pseudoneurotic and neurotic syndromes appeared. The outcome of the disorders was either with slow practical recovery or with a relatively stable personality change in the form of weakened volition, a reduction of energy, and a narrowing of the 'zone of comfort' due to the impairment of homeostatic functions. Often hypochondriasis could develop on the background of such features. Dysthymia is viewed as a special entity which must not be included either in the group of neuroses or in the group of typical organic brain syndromes, or in the group of endogenous psychoses.",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as “cot death” is one of the most serious, unexplained tregedies of our times. The term “SIDS” is used when a sleeping infant, under the age of one year, who has apparently been healthy, is found unexpectedly dead, and forensic evaluation that consists of scene investigation, forensic autopsy and examination of the medical records of the child, is unable to discern a cause of death. Multiple sleep-related mechanisms have been proposed to cause SIDS. These mechanisms include suffocation/asphyxiation in the face-down sleep position, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea, impaired-state-dependent responses to hypoxia and/ or hypercarbia, inadequate autoresuscitation, defective autonomic regulation of blood pressure or thermal responses, and abnormal arousal to life-threatening challenges during sleep. It has been a somewhat controversial term that on one hand has been criticized for not being a proper diagnosis with pathognomonic features, contrasting on the other hand with situations where it has been uncritically and inconsistently applied to all manner of infant deaths. It has been argued that SIDS constitutes a disease with a single cause, an argument which is at odds with those who feel that it is instead a syndrome with common features, and probable heterogeneous and additive risk factors. For this reason it has been called a “diagnosis without a disease”. Despite the shortcomings of forensic medicine, the SIDS story over the past several decades has been one of the great successes in infant healthcare.",

      "abstract": "Excessive sleepiness occurs frequently in the general population and is a common feature of many psychiatric conditions. The reductions in quality of life associated with excessive sleepiness may be substantial, involving compromised cognitive performance and work productivity as well as possible harm to the individual and the public. Excessive sleepiness may be the result of a number of extrinsic and intrinsic causes. Although it is an established symptom of certain psychiatric illnesses, abnormal excessive sleepiness in psychiatric patients may be the result of a comorbid disorder of sleep or wakefulness. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of sleep disorders are common in community psychiatric practices because clinicians may not be aware of the different causes and consequences of excessive sleepiness. It is essential to recognize and treat the underlying cause of this disorder. In cases where sleep disorders are suspected, a comprehensive treatment program might include nonpharmacologic approaches, pharmacologic approaches, or both may need to be initiated to encompass the complexity of sleep disorder treatments. Careful monitoring and follow-up of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including counseling and long-term support, are essential to ensure treatment compliance and to maintain improvements over time.",

It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset disturbance), difficulty staying asleep (sleep maintenance disturbance), or poor quality (nonrestorative) sleep, leading to impairment of next-day functioning, including psychological distress. Published prevalence estimates of insomnia vary considerably, very likely due to differences in definitions, study setting, and data collection methods. However, estimates based on large population-based surveys provide a rather constant prevalence rate for chronic insomnia in the United States of about 10% (approximately 25 million people). Chronic insomnia is associated with numerous physical and psychiatric conditions and is more common in women and the elderly. Although it is often perceived as a symptom of depression, insomnia is also a precursor of depression and is associated with a substantial increase in the relative risk of major depression. Chronic insomnia is correlated with impaired mood, subjective functioning, and quality of life and, in some cases, with increased daytime sleepiness and accident risk. Those reporting insomnia have higher rates of absenteeism and health care utilization. Direct costs of insomnia have been estimated to be $13.9 billion annually, with a large majority of costs attributable to nursing home care. Chronic insomnia is a common problem, often associated with negative waking mood or function. As such, heightened clinical attention and clinical research appear warranted.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The relevance of sleep/waking rhythms to issues of human consciousness is reviewed from data in the literature and from personal studies. Consciousness is often considered to be markedly attenuated or absent in sleep. There is, however, much evidence for a rich subjective experience during sleep, much of which is not recalled later. This implies that William James' \"stream of consciousness\" persists continuously throughout sleep as well as wakefulness, but that problems of memory recall interfere with its being reported as such. Sleeping subjects show selective awareness of external stimuli, with significant stimuli generally leading to awakening and relatively nonsignificant stimuli, at least at times, being incorporated into the ongoing mental activity of REM or NREM sleep. Mentation throughout sleep is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and little willful control. Creative insight and problem solving of a very high order may occur in sleep and involve either dreaming or thought-like mentation. Parameters of waking consciousness show possibly sleep-related rhythmic fluctuations at both circadian (24 hr sleep/ waking) and ultradian (90–120 min, NREM/REM sleep) rates. Moreover, waking consciousness is markedly influenced by the quality of temporal stability of preceding sleep. A substantial number of so-called \"altered states of consciousness\" is found to involve primarily or exclusively dysfunction of sleep/waking mechanisms. Cerebral lesions can produce selective impairment of aspects of sleep mentation. It is concluded that further analysis of subjective awareness in sleep or in partial sleep states is very relevant and indeed vital to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Major sleep disorders, independent of whether the dominant complaint is excessive daytime sleepiness or initiating or maintaining sleep, include a sleep deprivation component. Awakenings and arousals were defined based on electroencephalographic recordings using central leads. Some investigators tried to define \"awakenings\" behaviorally by analyzing continuous video recordings. Periodic limb movement disorder, originally described by Symonds as \"nocturnal myoclonus\", was questioned as being an epileptic equivalent. Restless legs syndrome is a dysesthesia that presents an important circadian relationship. Objective evaluations of the consequences of the sleep fragmentation are few in number. Most of them have been performed through studies of sleep-disordered breathing syndromes: upper airway resistance syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Insomnias are a cause of sleep deprivation. Menopause is also associated with sleep disruption. Often the reaction to this component will lead to a worsening of abnormal sleep, impacting on sleep hygiene, circadian timing of sleep-wake, and/or conditioning against sleep.",

For these behaviours to subside, folks should systematically enforce a certain time of day and clear limits, sometimes for days to weeks. Improvement is commonly preceded by a transient worsening of the unwanted behaviours, creating the initial number of days of treatment most difficult. Before embarking on management, it's better for fogeys to line clear expectations for night-time behaviour (‘You have to be compelled to keep in your bed overnight’) and do a fast check for desires (eg rest room or drink) before lights out. folks will then make a choice from ‘controlled comforting’ (see above), ‘extinction’ or ‘bedtime pass’ technique.",

One of the most common sleeping disorders among adults, insomnia, affects roughly 33-50% of the adult population and is characterized by difficulties getting to sleep and staying asleep. Insomnia is not only a standalone disorder but also a contributing risk factor for other health issues, including diabetes, obesity, asthma, chronic pain syndrome, depression, anxiety disorders, and cardiovascular illnesses. Moreover, sleeplessness is frequently linked to other mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition to the physical and mental health implications, insomnia also leads to impairments in daytime functioning and can greatly reduce an individual's quality of life.",

While the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome has a pronounced increase across the lifespan (1-3), the prevalence of psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders remains somewhat constant frommiddle to old age (4). Sleep disturbance is a symptom criterion across a number of psychiatric illnesses, including many of the mood and anxiety disorders as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th revision (DSM) (5). Most commonly, the sleep disturbance is in the form of an insomnia complaint and to a lesser extent it relates to hypersomnia and other common disorders of sleep such as sleep apnea. Alterations in sleep architecture are evidenced across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders when sleep is subjected to polysomnographic evaluation. It is also the case that a host of psychotropic medications either alter sleep architecture and/or contribute to subjective sleep complaints.",

It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

      "title": "The mechanism of sleep, dreams, and sleep deficiency",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital function to all species for reinvigorating the mental and physical senses. During sleep, specific synapses become less active to eliminate unneeded memories as other synapses strengthen to enhance memory consolidation. Healthy quality and longevity of sleep can also regulate moods by ridding fatigue and repairing integrity of the medial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connections. External disturbances affect the quality of sleep, and an individual's routine may play a role in the development of sleeping disorders. By irregulating the circadian rhythm and having consistent negative sleeping habits, sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea may develop. Eight to nine hours of sleep are recommended to both teenagers and adults, if less is received, difficulty in concentration and interpretation of information may be present, as well as physiological effects such as higher blood pressure caused by the disrupted regulation of stress hormones, which if continued, can make the body more prone to serious health conditions.The science of sleep and dreaming comprises a relevant thesis in modern neuroscience research and issues major comprehensions on the study of human consciousness. Dreams are an integral part of sleep. Sleep and dream cycles vary in phenomenology, characteristics, and under circumstances, interpretation of the individual. Various theories such as Sigmun Freud's Psychodynamic theory, the activation synthesis model, and the cognitive development theory have been created and numerous studies are ongoing as the principal motive of dreams has not yet been concluded. Some theories remain heavily physiological as high difficulty of investigations are discontinued by scientists and deemed unverifiable. The research presented here revolves around the neurology of sleep as to inquire into the physiology and investigations on the purpose of dreams. We thus conclude the current review with a call for further research directed towards the primary purpose of sleep and dream.",

The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

Nightmares are more likely to occur in REM sleep and, however unpleasant, are normal events suggesting that the maintenance of these emotional systems of the brain, which ensure our survival, may be one of the functions of brain activation in sleep.

Occupational health, in its practice and research, has a key role in supporting and sustaining workers' mental health. The work relevant mental ill-health conditions that continue to prevail are occupational stress, anxiety and depression. Occupational stress is accepted as a multifaceted condition that does not arise from one specific hazard or displays one specific symptom. The management of occupational stress is likely to be unsuccessful unless a clear understanding of what may be causing the stress is gained. Burnout is a 'known' phenomenon in the workplace, with increased interest in its occurrence in recent times. Severe fatigue, a serious inability to function both physically and mentally, can occur in as many as 3% of the working population at any one time.",

      "abstract": "The paralysis that occurs when waking up causes fear and anxiety, called sleep paralysis (SP). SP occurs between the stages of sleep and wakefulness. When SP occurred, the subject felt fully awake but unable to move, perceived with sensations such as chest pressure, shortness of breath, and hallucination of images of scary figures. The muscle paralysis that occurs in REM functions to protect oneself from making dangerous movements while dreaming. Muscle atonia that continues into the next stage causes SP. SP is often identified with folklore related to supernatural phenomena. The hallucinations that arise in SP are associated with creepy creatures in certain cultural contexts. For example, in Indonesia, it is commonly referred to as trance due to the disturbance of spirits. Neurologically, SP can be explained scientifically where during sleep, the CNS remains active, but muscle movement is paralyzed. The shadows seen in SP are influenced by cognitive roles. Several factors are thought to cause SP, including sleep quality, psychological factors such as trauma and anxiety, and stressful environmental factors. AbstrakKelumpuhan yang terjadi ketika bangun tidur menimbulkan ketakutan dan kecemasan. Secara medis, kondisi ini disebut dengan sleep paralysis (SP) atau kelumpuhan tidur yang terjadi antara tahap tidur dan terjaga. Pada SP, subjek seolah-olah merasa terjaga sempurna, namun tidak mampu bergerak, disertai sensasi berupa dada terasa tertekan, sesak napas, dan muncul bayangan sosok menyeramkan. Kelumpuhan otot gerak yang terjadi REM berfungsi untuk melindungi diri agar tidak melakukan gerakan membahayakan ketika sedang bermimpi. Atonia otot yang berlanjut ke tahap berikutnya menimbulkan SP. SP kerap diidentikkan dengan folklore terkait fenomena supranatural. Halusinasi yang muncul pada SP dikaitkan dengan makhluk menyeramkan di konteks budaya tertentu, misalnya di Indonesia yang familiar disebut “ketindihan” akibat gangguan makhluk halus. Secara neurologis, SP dapat dijelaskan secara ilmiah dimana pada saat tidur CNS tetap aktif namun otot gerak mengalami kelumpuhan. Bayangan yang terlihat pada SP dipengaruhi oleh peran kognitif. Beberapa faktor diduga menjadi penyebab munculnya SP, diantaranya kualitas tidur, faktor psikologis berupa trauma dan kecemasan, serta faktor lingkungan yang penuh tekanan.",

Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night). Finally, delirium in an individual patient has one or more underlying medical etiologies.1 KeywordsFemoral Neck FractureNeuroleptic Malignant SyndromeAcute Confusional StateDelirious PatientElderly Medical PatientThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are becoming more prevalent. There is an overlap of symptoms related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and many psychiatric conditions. Complaints of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, and depressive symptoms can be related to both disease states. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by repetitive disruption of sleep by cessation of breathing and was first described in the 19th century by bedside observation during sleep. Physicians observed this cessation of breathing while the patient slept and postulated that these episodes were responsible for subsequent complaints of sleepiness. OSAS can coexist with major depressive disorder, exacerbate depressive symptoms, or be responsible for a large part of the symptom complex of depression. Additionally, in schizophrenia, sleep apnea may develop as a result of chronic neuroleptic treatment and its effect on gains in body weight, a major risk factor for the development of OSAS.It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea, namely excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Recognition of the existence of sleep apnea, prompt referral to a sleep specialist, and ultimately treatment of an underlying sleep disorder, such as OSAS, can ameliorate symptoms of psychiatric disease.",

Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

Somnipathies can objectively be identified by means of polygraphy. Overall, polysomnographic measures in patients with affective disorders differ most frequently and significantly from those in normal control subjects. Persistent sleep disturbances are associated with significant risk of both relapse and recurrence in mood disorders and an increased risk of suicide. In addition to changes in sleep architecture, patients with major depression show profoundly altered patterns of nocturnal hormone secretion, possibly through mechanisms that link regulation of sleep with neuroendocrine activity.

      "title": "Stress and insomnia – A vicious circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterised by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school and social settings. The common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, general discomfort and cognitive difficulties. On the other hand, stress results from emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can make a person feel frustrated, angry or anxious. Stress is the body’s response to a challenge or demand, accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stress depends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual’s characteristics, their neuroendocrine system and the combination of these elements, collectively determining how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, improving sleep hygiene and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than address its underlying cause. In the context of homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual’s unique structure, composition, nature and physical makeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualise each case and administer a simillimum remedy, the remedy most likely to restore health, and achieve complete healing according to homoeopathic principles. This review explores the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur due to the interplay between stress and the development of insomnia.",

      "title": "Understanding the pathophysiology of insomnia (Anidra) with special reference to primary insomnia using neurotransmitter sleep theories: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a primordial requirement for human sustenance and its role in health is inevitable. Despite its importance, inadequate sleep is one of the most common complaints across the globe. Ayurveda identifies Nidra (sleep) as one of the three supporting pillars of life and attributes its maintenance not only to health but also to longevity and prosperity; in contrast, Anidra (disturbed sleep) is one of the contributing factors for disease. Ayurveda clearly identifies the factors in Anidra which are vitiation of Pitta or Vata (fundamental humors of the body), Manasantapa (psycho-social stress), Kshaya (debilitating factors), or Abhighata (injury/trauma). Insomnia is characterized by reduced quality or quantity of sleep and has effects on the quality of life of the affected individual. It can be the difficulty of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening, which can have a significant impact on the daily activity of the individual. The contemporary science is yet to give a definite theory for the physiology of sleep and the pathophysiology of insomnia. The most widely accepted and researched concept is the role of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, melatonin and their effects in the regulation of sleep–wake cycle. These neurotransmitters and their effect on sleep physiology and pathology of insomnia need to be further explored in order to improve its management strategies. Hence, this review aims to determine the possible relation between the concepts of Nidra (sleep) and Anidra (disturbed sleep) mentioned in Ayurveda and these neurotransmitter sleep theories. This will help in improving the understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia, developing Ayurveda management protocols for insomnia, and also in explaining the pharmacodynamics of Ayurveda drugs better. The method used for review is by sourcing and analyzing the available data from Ayurveda and contemporary literature on the topic in discussion.",

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are usually multi-factorial in nature, very often without a single solution available.As with many interventive processes, there are unanticipated iatrogenic consequences, which cause further complications, and more intervention is then required.Sufficient evidence now exists to indicate that prevention of the onset of the symptoms, which are often referred to as 'the disease', can minimize or even eliminate the need for intervention.It is not possible for a person to have functional breathing during the day and dysfunctional breathing during the night, any more than it is to have the reverse situation.Given that the vast majority of people spend approximately two thirds of their lives awake and active, there is a significant likelihood that addressing daytime dysfunction is at least as important as, if not more important than, applying short -term nighttime intervention.",

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the situation and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

We discuss two patients with complex presentations. The first patient was diagnosed with sleep syncope, a relatively unknown type of reflex syncope. The prodromal symptoms of discomfort and the subsequent loss of consciousness occurred while the patient was in bed or got up to go to the toilet due to abdominal symptoms. The onset in supine position was misleading, since this is a well-known alarm symptom of a possible cardiac cause. The second patient had vasovagal syncope followed by a psychogenic pseudosyncope. This resulted in frequent loss of consciousness of long duration with typical and atypical triggers and uncommon syncopal signs, including eye closure. These conflicting symptoms can be a pitfall and clinical expertise is required to identify the type of syncope.",

The diagnosis is usually straight-forward on clinical grounds, but whereas sleep paralysis is non-specific, it is difficult to sustain a diagnosis without cataplexy (Parkes et al., 1995). ‘Jelly attacks’ with laughter, or in the anticipation of laughter, is how it is often described, and the muscles around the face might jerk.",

These events often involve bizarre and unusual behaviors, and can challenge even the most ardent sleep specialist or epileptologist. Although some events are uncommon, 3% of adults and 20% of children may have recurring nocturnal behaviors. Many of these events are passed off as little more than frivolous episodes. Yet, nocturnal events may provide important clues to sleep and neurological function. The diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal events can be difficult because of the frequent overlap of clinical descriptions and lack of diurnal findings. Patients may not follow the ''classical'' patterns of parasomnia or epilepsy, and some patients may have parasomnias provoked by other sleep disturbances or seizures. Thus, the diagnosis of these patients often requires intensive investigation and extensive neurophysiological monitoring.",

So much is this the case that often this explanation of your difficulties gets overlooked instead of being dealt with. Many people know they do not sleep well, although many do not ask for help and soldier on as best they can. Others are less aware that their sleep is unsatisfactory and that they could benefit if their sleep was improved. Ideally, a person’s sleep at night should be both long enough (adequate sleep) and also of sufficiently good quality to restore them, so that they feel well and can function properly during the day. Good-quality sleep means that sleep is sound and unbroken. In addition, sleep quality can be impaired (also called ‘fragmented’ sleep) by very brief arousals without you consciously waking up. This happens particularly in later life and in various sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (see Chapter 9), causing daytime sleepiness.",

Despite the experimental work which has been reported on the subject there is little accurate knowledge concerning the essential basis of the phenomena of sleep or concerning the real effects of disturbances of the rhythm of sleep. Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death. Normal sleep is disturbed in various organic conditions of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and dementia paralytica, as well as in the functional psychoses, in manic-depressive psychosis and in schizophrenia. This demonstrates clearly that an intact nervous system does",

These problems result in insufficient sleep at night, which then results in an increased risk of falls, difficulty with concentration and memory, and overall decreased quality of life. Difficulties sleeping, however, are not an inevitable part of aging. Rather, these sleep complaints are often secondary to medical and psychiatric illness, the medications used to treat these illnesses, circadian rhythm changes, or other sleep disorders. The task for the geriatric psychiatrist is to identify the causes of these complaints and then initiate appropriate treatment.

Only suppositions are possible with regard to the frequency of childhood's dreams. Most likely only the lighter sleep periods, just after falling asleep, or shortly before awakening, the restless sleep of sickness, are accompanied by vivid dream-fantasies. That such nervous fantasies are especially violent in feverish attacks is a matter of common knowledge. But, quite apart from health, even outer circumstances likely to disturb sleep may affect the child's dream-fantasy by producing terror; of this we have a very plain instance in Hilde. In one case the Scupins could very plainly observe the transition of a real dream-account into a confabulation; at the same time this example is interesting from the wealth of detail in the dream-account.",

      "abstract": "The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) defines insomnia simply as \"difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep\". Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

The daytime consequences of sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness as well as disturbances of mood and cognition. Sleep apnea may have a profoundly negative impact on daytime performance and well-being as well as on physical health and long-term survival, making it an important disorder for clinicians to identify. The sleep apnea syndromes vary in severity from patient to patient and in any one patient under different circumstances. Serious physical conditions are associated with chronic sleep apnea: high blood pressure, increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias during sleep, pulmonary hypertension. The sleep apnea syndromes may occur at any age but are more common with increasing age. Genetic factors are believed to be important in predisposing individuals to developing sleep apnea.

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

As the patient matures into an adult, sleep disorders continue to be common and an important factor in development, both social and cognitive. Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child&amp;#039;s ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

Sadness isn't a passing blue temperament, which nearly everybody encounters from time to time, but a complex mind/body sickness that meddling with ordinary working. It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

This review describes findings relating to sustained work stresses commonly found in our advancing technological world. Researchers report decrements in sustained performance as a function of fatigue, especially during and following one or more nights of complete sleep loss, or longer periods of reduced or fragmented sleep. Sleep loss appears to result in reduced reaction time, decreased vigilance, perceptual and cognitive distortions, and changes in affect. Sleep loss and workload interact with circadian rhythms in producing their effects. These interactions are a major source of stress in work situations requiring sustained work in continuous operations and have implications for theoretical models of sustained perceptual and cognitive functioning.

The spectrum of sleep disorders mirrors the clinical population of patients seen in a family medicine practice with most patients with sleep disturbance receiving their medical care in the primary care setting [1]. Despite a high prevalence of sleep disorders, sleep complains are under-addressed by physicians.

      "title": "The spectrum of disorders causing violence during sleep",
      "abstract": "Violent behavior during sleep is a common problem, affecting > 2% of the population > 15 years old as found in two large epidemiologic studies. The differential diagnosis of sleep related injury and violence includes: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); NREM sleep parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors); parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnias); obstructive sleep apnea; sexsomnia (sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors); sleep related dissociative disorder; trauma-associated sleep disorder/post-traumatic stress disorder; periodic limb movement disorder; rhythmic movement disorder; nocturnal scratching disorder; nocturnal seizures; and miscellaneous/mixed conditions. Careful clinical interviews, preferably with bed partners participating, and extensive, hospital-based, technologist-attended, overnight video-polysomnography (for one or more nights), is crucial for determining the accurate diagnosis that will guide proper therapy. Most of the disorders mentioned above are classified as parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, with parasomnias defined as abnormal behavioral, experiential and/or autonomic nervous system activity during entry into sleep, during any stage of sleep, and during emergence from any stage of sleep. Parasomnias are often manifestations of \"state dissociation\" in which components of one state of being (wake, REM sleep, NREM sleep) intrude into, and become admixed, with other states of being, with clinical consequences. There are forensic implications related to the parasomnias, with inadvertent and unintentional assaults, murder, and \"pseudo-suicide\" resulting from aggressive and violent behaviors arising from sleep with suspended awareness and judgement.",

      "title": "Report from the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Psychiatry and Sleep‐Wakefulness Disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, which is considered a psychiatric disorder itself, is the most common sleep-related complaint in the general population. Furthermore, complaints about sleep and wakefulness are among the most common and impairing symptoms in psychiatric patients. Disturbed sleep frequently precedes the onset of several mental disorders, exacerbates as mental disorders progress, and frequently presents as a residual and treatment-resistant symptom. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in sleep research and the treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders in psychiatry, although many questions remain to be answered1. We still do not know exactly the causative link(s) between the various psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints, although it would be important to know, for instance, whether early treatment of sleep disturbances can prevent the development of depressive disorders. Moreover, the relationship between subjective complaints of insomnia patients and objective polysomnographic results remains elusive, and we do not know whether the health consequences of insomnia, for example on metabolic systems, are related to subjective or objective measures of sleep, or both. Besides objective methods for assessing sleep and wakefulness – such as polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, multiple sleep latency test, and maintenance of wakefulness test – there is now considerable literature on various biomarkers for sleep disorders. For insomnia, the measures with the highest performance include PSG-derived cyclic alternating patterns, actigraphy, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. These are followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and specific neuroimaging patterns, mainly reflecting the activity of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia2. For central disorders of hypersomnolence, novel measures derived from quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), high-density EEG, cognitive testing, structural and functional neuroimaging, and pupillometry have been proposed3. Significant progress has also been made in the assessment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In addition to established laboratory protocols, circadian rhythms can now be assessed through long-term ambulatory monitoring of activity, skin temperature, heart rate, and light exposure4. Significant progress has also been made in the treatment of insomnia, emphasizing not only the role of appropriate pharmacotherapy but, above all, non-pharmacological treatment options. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently recommended as the evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic insomnia, also in patients with comorbidities5. This treatment includes techniques such as sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep education and hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring. These techniques help strengthen the basic sleep-regulating mechanisms, including the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, and reduce sleep-related anxiety and arousal6. The treatment of insomnia in psychiatry should be based on an integration of pharmacotherapy (including novel medications, such as orexin antagonists) and non-pharmacological interventions, to address psychological and behavioral factors that contribute to the development or persistence of insomnia. It is particularly important to emphasize the need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, getting up at the same time every day, even after a night of poor sleep, and to exercise regularly. Additionally, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting naps and rest periods during the day are essential. To prevent insomnia, it is also important to limit screen time during the day and avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least one hour before bed. Several new wakefulness-promoting agents have been introduced for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence7. Moreover, it is now well recognized that effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with mental disorders is critical for improving their response to treatment, quality of life, and overall health7. As the prevalence of sleep and wakefulness disorders has further increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in deterioration of mental health and increased alcohol and hypnotic use8, it is evident that mental health professionals require effective training in diagnosing and treating disrupted sleep. People with mental disorders can greatly benefit from mental health services that incorporate routine assessment and treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders within standard care pathways. Consequently, the main aim of the WPA Section on Psychiatry and Sleep-Wakefulness Disorders is to educate psychiatrists in recognizing and giving appropriate attention to sleep disturbances (such as insomnia and hypersomnolence) and in being able to provide guidance to their patients on the importance of basic sleep hygiene rules. The education of psychiatrists should also include awareness on obstructive sleep apnea, which can manifest with psychiatric symptoms, including increased daytime sleepiness, fatigue or loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, mood swings, emotional instability, and cognitive dysfunction such as impaired memory, attention and executive functions. These psychiatric manifestations highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea promptly, as managing the sleep disorder can improve overall well-being and quality of life. Moreover, since 30-40% of patients with chronic insomnia fulfill diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea, screening for this condition should be performed before initiating any hypnotic medication. This is crucial, because medications such as benzodiazepines are contraindicated in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Such screening can be performed with short questionnaires such as the STOP-BANG. This questionnaire consists of eight yes-or-no questions, focusing on snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, pressure (high blood pressure), body mass index, age, neck circumference, and gender (male). Each \"yes\" answer scores one point. A higher total score indicates a greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea9. Our WPA Section has been active for many years. Its activities have been focused on providing information about sleep and sleep-related disorders to clinical health professionals, as well as optimizing the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances in patients with mental disorders. Since sleep is an interdisciplinary field, one of our main goals is to connect sleep specialists from around the world. We believe that our Section can mediate between basic researchers, clinicians, educational institutions, scientific professional societies, health care institutions, and governmental authorities, in order to improve the recognition and treatment of sleep disorders. Our Section's action plan for 2023-2026 includes several goals. A primary one is advancing research and knowledge about disturbances of sleep and wakefulness in patients with mental disorders, by fostering collaboration between basic researchers, clinical scientists, and health care providers. Additionally, we will keep focusing on education and training on diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, by organizing workshops, webinars and scientific conferences with WPA involvement. Furthermore, we will be active in promoting clinical practice guidelines, to improve the quality and interdisciplinary nature of care in people with mental disorders suffering from disturbed sleep. A major goal also pertains to engaging in policy and advocacy, by calling for pertinent actions in support of research and public health initiatives to improve access of patients with mental disorders to sleep medicine services. We will also be supporting the building up of networking and collaboration, by fostering relationships with scientific societies to promote interdisciplinary research and clinical care. To this end, our Section has already organized a highly successful symposium, \"State of the Art in the Management of Insomnia\", during the World Congress of Psychiatry in 2023. Finally, we intend to develop public sleep health campaigns to educate the public on sleep hygiene, health consequences of poor sleep, and prevention of sleep disorders. By implementing this action plan, our Section can play a pivotal role in advancing the field, improving patient care, and promoting the importance of sleep health in the broader mental health context.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "title": "Burnout Syndrome in Professional Workers Who Deal with Treated Alcoholics",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONProfessional stress1 represents an imbalance of workplace requirements and surroundings with our abilities, wishes and expectations concerning fulfilling these requirements. The long-term exposure to professional stress results in the burnout syndrome, the most unfavorable outcome, which affects particularly the helping professions (psychiatrists, social workers, nurses...).2 One of the definitions states that the burnout syndrome is a gradual process in which once a productive and responsible worker loses all interest in his/her work or profession.3 It is a cumulative process that comes with small warning signs. Years can go by till symptoms are manifested as psychological or emotional problems as these signs are often diminutive. The burnout syndrome consists of four stages. The first stage, beginners enthusiasm is characterized by unreal expectations and self-investing of helper followed by high level of energy and good achievements. Second one is a stagnation stage in which helper starts to understand that work isn't as imagined, which is followed by the first appearance of physical and psychological exhaustion, pessimism and a lack of satisfaction with work. Isolation stage is the third stage, characterized by emotional withdrawal, avoiding contacts with colleagues, depression, negativism, angriness and hostility. Syndrome progression continues, sped by physical difficulties (chronic exhaustion, insomnia, headache, allergies etc.). Apathy and a lack of life interests, as a final stage, are the results of chronic frustration and complete lack of interest. Characteristics symptoms are loss of self-confidence, cynicism, serious emotional difficulties, not being able to communicate and work with colleagues and diminished interpersonal relations.4The burnout syndrome can be stopped before the helper arrives at the last stage. The whole process can be turned the other way around by changing the working goals, attitudes and behaviors in the work surroundings,5 as the cause of professional stress can be internal and external.The mental help of professional workers is at risk because of their everyday need to communicate with treated alcoholics, listen to the life problems, traumatic events, losses and similar issues.6 They are mostly unaware of how this line of work affects them and they avoid asking for help. Not recognizing the burnout syndrome, professional workers are themselves at risk of developing a negative attitude towards the treated alcoholics and provide ineffective and inadequate help.Aim of this study was to investigate if professional workers recognized the burnout syndrome in working with treated alcoholics; if professional workers who work with treated alcoholics suffered from burnout syndrome; which profession is the most affected by the burnout syndrome and if there were any differences in social-demographic features and to see used strategies of self-help.METHODS AND SAMPLEThe questionnaire consisted of 36 questions divided into two parts. The first part referred to professional workers' perception of the burnout syndrome and its causes, and the second part was The Burnout Syndrome Questionnaire1 (appendix).The study included 40 professional workers (doctors, social workers, nurses, psychologist, special teachers),8,9 mainly from the city of Zagreb (Table 1). 40% of them work with treated alcoholics in Departments of Psychiatry in three Zagreb University Hospitals, 37.5% work only in clubs for treated alcoholics and 22.5% work in both. The structure of professional workers in relation to the working place was expected. In hospitals, representation of nurses and doctors was highest, but in clubs for treated alcoholics there were more social workers (Table 2). The mean age of professional workers was 45 years (min. - 24, max - 68), while the mean duration of working with treated alcoholics was 15 years (min. - 1, max. - 40), which means 22 hours per week (min. …",

      "abstract": "Recurrent lucid dreaming is unusual and may be associated with an underlying sleep disorder. These are clear, emotionally pleasant dreams where the person is aware they are dreaming and capable of controlling content. They are usually initiated from REM sleep, but without loss of atonia. However, pathologic lucid dreams are associated with negative content and can result in sleep disruption with excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. The etiology is unknown and we present a case of pathologic lucid dreams occurring after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A 58-year-old man presents with complaints of sleep fragmentation beginning 15 years earlier since he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He experienced lucid dreaming since young adulthood without negative symptoms. Since his fibromyalgia, he complains of frequent purposeful awakening from his dreams due to unpleasant content and difficulty controlling them. He now feels as if he is awake throughout the night and has excess daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography showed increased REM and absent slow wave sleep without obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder or abnormal movements, or seizures. Treatment for fibromyalgia included various opiates, antidepressants, and pregabalin without improvement in sleep. We initiated prazosin and very low dose methadone, which resulted in improvement sleep fragmentation, tolerance to dream content, and frequency of dreams. Additionally, he had improved daytime function, decreased pain and daytime sleepiness. Lucid dreams are unusual, but are considered normal. However, pathologic lucid dreams are abnormal. The etiology and prevalence are unknown. Patients may be misdiagnosed with nightmares or hypersomnia with possible narcolepsy. Because he responded to prazosin and methadone treatment, we hypothesize that increased hypersensitivity of the monoaminergic system secondary to uncontrolled fibromyalgia may have been the reason behind these pathologic lucid dreams.",

Although, the importance of emotional ventilation can never be understated in order to manage mental health, according to the WHO, depression is a mental disorder that is identified by a loss of pleasure or interest in daily activities for a long period of time, the causes of which may vary from physical or emotional abuse to severe losses in life. Depression needs to be diagnosed and treated, whereas the misuse of the term may lead to misidentification and the illusion that talking to loved ones and getting indulged in one’s favourite activities can cure it.",

Scientifically, fainting is called a «syncope» state (the word «syncope» comes from the Greek syn meaning «with, together» and koptein — «to cut off, tear off»), and is characterized by a short-term loss of consciousness against the background of transient hypoperfusion of the brain and a drop in muscle tone. The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which people come to their senses on their own. After fainting, feelings of general weakness, overexhaustion, and fatigue are possible; for elderly people, the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is typical. In the vast majority of cases, syncope is of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting is associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Notably, in some cases the cause of syncope cannot be established [4].",

      "title": "Neurologic Complications in Critically III Patients",
      "abstract": "Critically ill patients are at risk for neurologic complications [1,2]. Many of these complications are part of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; others are simply manifestations of a more fulminant disease process. Neurologic complications may put an end to the expectation of full recovery, and outcome is often poor. Neurologic complications in critically ill patients were found in 12% of 175 consecutively studied patients in a medical intensive care unit, but they are likely to be even more prevalent in trauma and transplant units. Patients in whom neurologic complications develop during critical illness have twice the length of stay and are twice as likely to die [1]. Neurologic assessment in the intensive care unit is limited because many patients are fatigued, sleep-deprived, confused, uncooperative, or heavily sedated and are often treated with neuromuscular blocking drugs. There are large gaps in our knowledge of neurologic complications in critically ill patients. Neurologic complications often revolve around three main disturbances: muscle weakness, impaired consciousness, and seizures. This review describes common clinical neurologic complications of a potentially life-threatening illness. Coma or Failure to Awaken A puzzling clinical situation is the failure of patients to awaken after the critical illness has subsided. Familiar to intensive care specialists is the patient receiving mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure who does not fully recover to a normal level of consciousness after withdrawal of analgesics, sedatives, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. Neurologic signs typically associated with metabolic encephalopathy, such as multifocal myoclonus, asterixis, and tremor, are absent. The differential diagnosis in these patients is shown in Table 1. Despite the use of new short-acting pharmacologic drugs, a common cause of altered consciousness in critically ill patients is related to the previous administration of sedative drugs that have accumulated over days because of diminished clearance or pharmacologic interaction. In many other patients, an anoxic-ischemic insult from brief but significant hypoxemia or hypotension may produce a diffuse encephalopathy that lingers for weeks.Table 1: Major Causes of Coma in Intensive Care UnitsIn medical intensive care units, failure to awaken often occurs in association with sepsis [3,4]. The central nervous system manifestations in sepsis have not been studied in great detail. Patients with acute confusional episodes or any other persistent cognitive abnormality have been said to have \"septic encephalopathy.\" Whether a distinct metabolic encephalopathy of sepsis exists after exclusion of confounding factors remains unknown. In progressive multiple organ dysfunction from sepsis, severe hypoglycemia, marked hypotension necessitating increasing doses of inotropic medication, and significant hypercapnia may all contribute to impairment of consciousness. Suggested mechanisms for encephalopathy associated with sepsis are decreased cerebral blood flow with similar changes in cerebral extraction ratios, disordered amino acid transport similar to hepatic encephalopathy, microabscesses, and possibly, sustained hypotension, suggesting that septic encephalopathy may be more hypoxemic-ischemic in nature [2]. Whether cytokines, such as interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor, directly influence arousal remains unresolved. Other mimicking clinical conditions, such as multiple small intracranial hematomas, should be excluded and may be found as part of disseminated intravascular coagulation [5]. Outcome of patients with septic encephalopathy who remain in coma is poor [4,6]. A possibly underrecognized cause of coma after any type of critical illness is cholesterol embolization. Recent arteriographic procedures may be implicated [7,8]. In a retrospective review of pathologic material from patients who died six months after vascular catheterization, the incidence of cholesterol embolization was 25%, with embolization to the central nervous system in 5% of the patients [8]. The clinical recognition of neurologic manifestations of cholesterol embolization may be difficult, and the signs of diffuse encephalopathy, retinal hemorrhages, and transient hemiparesis are not specific. The positive predictive value of systemic manifestations, such as livedo reticularis, purple toes, renal failure, and muscle weakness, may be higher [8]. Both muscle and renal biopsy specimens may show stacked, needle-shaped crystals. It has been suggested that muscle biopsy has a high sensitivity for demonstrating cholesterol embolization [8]. By comparison, a frequent cause of coma in a surgical intensive care unit is acute renal failure producing acute uremic encephalopathy. Acute uremia occurs in approximately 20% of surgical critically ill patients; conversely, acute dialysis in the hospital is associated with perioperative acute renal failure [9,10]. Valvular heart surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting, and aortic aneurysm surgery typically are associated with postoperative acute renal failure, but the incidence is also high in liver transplantation [11,12] and in major surgical repairs complicated by sepsis or involving significant abdominal gastrointestinal exploration and repair. The development of acute uremia in surgical patients dramatically increases the risk of mortality, which approaches 100% if mechanical ventilation is necessary [10]. The most common causes of acute renal failure in surgically ill patients are renal hypoperfusion and nephrotoxic insults. Not unexpectedly, left ventricular dysfunction, diabetes, and use of nephrotoxic antibiotics are major risk factors in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. Coma from uremic encephalopathy usually develops gradually from drowsiness, asterixis, and myoclonus to an unresponsive state with virtually no motor response to pain. Frontal release signs may be seen, such as marked snout response or brief jerks of retroflexion of the neck after glabellar tapping and grasp reflexes. Typically, the cranial nerves remain intact, as in many metabolic encephalopathies. Uremic encephalopathy usually is the clear overriding cause of coma when blood urea nitrogen and creatinine have doubled in value, but hypoxemia from significant acute respiratory distress syndrome or increased bilirubin from liver failure may contribute. The effect of dialysis is critical in prognostication. Failure to awaken may indicate that hypoxemic, anoxic, or hypotensive events have occurred. The clinical signs of uremic encephalopathy may completely resolve after dialysis, but in many patients in the surgical intensive care unit, a baseline drowsiness persists after dialysis. After dialysis, a dysequilibrium syndrome may occur, but it is rare. The typical presentation includes combative behavior, severe throbbing headache when lying flat, and myoclonic jerks and cramps. The circumstances almost always include rapid dialysis, extreme baseline predialysis blood urea nitrogen, and first dialysis. More dramatic presentations may include cortical blindness and coma preceded by seizures. Computed tomography scanning may demonstrate significant swelling. Many patients die hours after onset [13,14]. In surgical intensive care units, failure to awaken can be associated with ischemic strokes in multiple arterial territories. This devastating complication frequently occurs after major cardiovascular repairs [15]. Patients in coma from ischemic strokes immediately after surgery often have had a significant perioperative event. Typically, the level of consciousness fails to improve after washout of high doses of narcotic analgesics and anesthetics. In these patients, a brief but significant hypotensive episode may have been noted during surgery, but the anatomical territories of ischemic stroke, often multiple, in these patients do not fit a typical watershed territory Figure 1. Other established sources of postoperative ischemic stroke are retained left ventricular thrombus, severe atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta with marked circumferential involvement of most of this segment and protruding atheroma [16], and postoperative atrial fibrillation [17].Figure 1: Computed tomography scan in a patient with multiple strokes after coronary artery bypass grafting. Note hypodensities in both anterior and middle cerebral artery territories.In many patients, microemboli may cause prolonged neuropsychologic abnormalities. Intellectual deterioration may vary greatly and become evident after the patients return home [18]. With extensive neuropsychologic testing, there may be a prevalence of 30%, which is much higher than that in ischemic strokes in large cerebrovascular territories. In fact, magnetic resonance imaging scans did not find any detectable change after coronary artery bypass grafts [19]. Resuscitation for cardiac or respiratory arrest during any type of critical illness may result in postanoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [20]. Comatose patients after cardiac resuscitation may show clinical signs portending a dismal outlook. Coma alone has no predictive value in the first three days [20]. Certainly, if fixed pupils and myoclonus status epilepticus (brief, persistent, and generalized jerks in limbs and face) are associated with a sustained upward gaze, the probability of a persistent vegetative state and death is high in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest [21,22]. In 40% of comatose patients with myoclonus status epilepticus, computed tomographic scan abnormalities of multiple cerebral infarcts or cerebral edema are demonstrated. It is highly probable that status myoclonus is an agonal phenomenon and should be considered a clinical marker for devastating damage to the brain. Patients in coma after cardiac or respiratory resuscitation can be further investigated by somatosensory evoked potentials. The absence of a bilateral cortical somatosensory response (N20 and P27) with a preserved cervical somatosensory response strongly predicts a vegetative state [23]. Further management decisions should be influenced by these findings. Another population of critically ill patients with a propensity for central nervous system involvement are those who have undergone transplantation, notably liver and heart recipients. After liver transplantation, prompt awakening often signifies adequate graft function. When perioperative sedation has been excluded, failure of patients to awaken after liver transplantation may have several causes. Patients with fulminant hepatic failure are prone to the development of increased intracranial pressure from brain edema [24] and during the anhepatic phase may even have a brief surge in intracranial pressure. In an extremely unfortunate situation, brain death is diagnosed postoperatively [24]. Typically, recovery from cerebral edema takes days before level of consciousness improves. In approximately 10% of patients after liver transplantation, neurotoxicity to cyclosporine develops as early as three days after intravenous administration [25,26]. An acute confusional state with paranoid behavior, tremors, and speech abnormalities may be seen. Some patients become mute, but coma with abnormal motor responses is rare, occurring only if cyclosporine neurotoxicity is not recognized. Magnetic resonance imaging changes in the white matter have been reported with severe manifestations of cyclosporine toxicity [25]. Seizures may occur in the first postoperative days, and, if nonconvulsive status epilepticus follows, it may be a potential cause of failure to awaken. This phenomenon can be recognized in many patients by waxing and waning alertness, stereotypical behavior, and occasional twitching in the face and limbs. Central pontine myelinolysis is a less common cause for failure to awaken in recipients of liver transplants, but it may be underreported [27]. In our series of patients undergoing liver transplantation, we found an incidence of 1% and all presented with stupor. Rapid shifts in plasma osmolality and plasma sodium have been implicated [28,29], but the relationship was not evident in our survey of patients with central pontine myelinolysis [30]. Central pontine myelinolysis can be confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which shows a typical bat- or trident-shaped abnormality on axial T2-weighted images. (The trident shape is explained by relative preservation of the corticospinal tracts Figure 2.) Central pontine myelinolysis, although dramatic in its clinical and neuroimaging presentation, has a reasonable potential for recovery [31,32].Figure 2: Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance image of the pons showing typical trident-shaped high-intensity signal after liver transplantation.Intracranial hematomas are uncommon (less than 1%) but have been found more often in patients with associated thrombocytopenia, bacteremia, or fungemia [33]. In some patients, a mycotic aneurysm can be implicated. Generally, infectious causes of coma after liver transplantation are uncommon. Patients with a transplanted heart generally do well in the perioperative phase. Neurotoxicity from immunosuppression (cyclosporine, OKT3) is uncommon in the intensive care unit [34-36]. Possible reasons are meticulous monitoring of OKT3 dosage by determination of the degree of decrease in CD3 cells in OKT3 and use of cyclosporine at a later stage rather than induction therapy in many immunosuppressive protocols. Patients with cardiac transplants, however, are at particular risk for ischemic stroke [36]. A history of stroke and preoperative carotid stenosis of more than 50% significantly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. After heart or heart-lung transplantation, however, ischemic stroke is most frequently associated with retained thrombi within the graft anastomosis. In summary, multiple causes of coma can be considered in critically ill patients. The setting (medical or surgical intensive care unit) may be important in the differential diagnosis. Unexplained coma should be evaluated by cerebrospinal fluid examination and repeat computed tomography scanning, but the decision to perform additional diagnostic tests in patients who are critically ill and become comatose depends on the underlying condition. In many patients, the cause of coma is obvious after careful review of the medical record. Particular attention should be paid to acute changes in laboratory values (e.g., major shifts in plasma sodium or osmolality), hypoxemic periods or cardiac arrhythmias documented during recent invasive procedures, and any recent change in medication or dosage. Computed tomography scanning should be repeated when initial findings are normal and the neurologic examination is not localizing. Cerebral infarcts may become more evident two to three days after sudden neurologic deterioration. The major causes of coma in medical and surgical intensive care units are summarized in Table 1. Generalized Muscle Weakness Fatigue can be expected in critically ill patients after they have survived their illness. An underlying neurologic abnormality should be considered when the patient is mobilized in a chair but appears considerably weak, when the patient cannot support weight, or when weaning failure cannot be readily explained by previous lung disease or new lung injury. At least three major categories have been recognized: axonal polyneuropathy (critical illness polyneuropathy), typically associated with sepsis; acute steroid myopathy, potentially associated with use of neuromuscular junction blockers; and an as yet undefined prolonged muscle weakness after neuromuscular junction blockers, which may represent a toxic myopathy. (The results of electromyographic and nerve conduction studies are often normal.) The definition of all these syndromes continues to be confusing. Many other possibilities should be considered, and in some patients a previously undiagnosed neurologic disorder may have been present that initially appeared with respiratory failure. The differential diagnoses to be considered in patients in medical and surgical intensive care units are listed in Table 2.Table 2: Causes of Generalized WeaknessaProspective studies of causes of weakness in the intensive care unit are few. Polyneuropathy is most commonly a cause of generalized weakness in the intensive care unit (\"critical illness polyneuropathy\") [37]. The prevalence in intensive care units is not exactly known, but it may occur in 5%-20% of all patients with sepsis and in 50% of patients remaining in the unit more than two weeks [38-40]. Polyneuropathy of critical illness is often seen in association with sepsis. Factors associated with this type of polyneuropathy include age, extended stay in the intensive care unit, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglycemia. The clinical features of critical illness polyneuropathy are normal cranial nerve findings, although grimacing may be weak [37,38]. Limb weakness is usually severe and more prominent in the distal distribution. Areflexia is invariably present. Prominent muscle wasting may be observed. Pinprick is usually diminished in a stocking-glove pattern. The disorder resolves in a stereotypical manner: improvement in the upper and proximal portions of the lower limbs is followed by successful weaning and later recovery of the distal muscles of the lower limbs. Outcome is generally good if the patient survives the critical illness [37]. As expected with axonal regeneration, three to four months is needed for improvement. A recent study found a severe residual functional handicap in 20% of seven-year survivors with polyneuropathy [39]. Some patients have persistent weakness of the foot flexors from entrapment neuropathy of the peroneal nerve [37]. Compression neuropathy of the peroneal nerve may occur when paralyzed limbs are everted. Trochanter rolls can prevent this unnecessary complication. Electrophysiologic studies in critical illness polyneuropathy may show typical features of axonal damage, with low amplitudes of compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials, widespread fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves, but nerve conduction velocities are perserved [41]. Phrenic nerve conduction is often absent [37,38]. Autopsy or sural nerve biopsy specimens show severe axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves, mostly in the distal segments. Another important cause of generalized muscle weakness is the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs, particularly pancuronium and vecuronium. Most patients recover within days after administration is discontinued, but some remain weak for weeks. The mechanism of weakness is unresolved. Careful, repeated studies of the neuromuscular junction have not been done, and findings may be normal despite marked limb weakness. A recent prospective study found that metabolites of vecuronium may accumulate in patients with renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hypermagnesemia [42]. Electrophysiologic data for these patients with prolonged weakness were not available. Complete recovery can be expected [42]. The prevalence of prolonged weakness is low; a recent report noted the occurrence in only 1 of 58 prospectively studied patients. It is unclear whether monitoring with a peripheral nerve stimulator can prevent this complication [43]. A well-recognized but uncommon complication of intravenously administered neuromuscular blocking drugs is acute necrotic myopathy, possibly when the drug is given in combination with large doses of corticosteroids (usually up to 1 g/d) [44,45]. The typical patient in whom the complication occurs has status asthmaticus. Significant loss of myosin has been reported [45]. The outcome appears to be excellent, but data are limited. Recently, a myopathy was described in lung transplant patients. Muscle biopsy revealed loss of myosin. All patients received large doses of corticosteroids but no neuromuscular blocking agents, and sepsis did not develop. Normal creatine kinase levels virtually excluded rhabdomyolysis as a possibility. The underlying cause of this selective loss of myosin is unclear, nor is it clear whether this represents a new syndrome or a variant of acute steroid myopathy [46]. We found that severe necrotic myopathy was more common than polyneuropathy in liver transplant patients but were unable to further delineate the abnormality [47]. Rhabdomyolysis may be a source of weakness in critically ill patients. The most common causes are trauma, ischemia of large muscle compartments from arterial occlusion, and sepsis. Myoglobinuria can be found when rhabdomyolysis is massive. Many patients have considerable weakness and pain. Biceps, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles are tender on palpation and may appear swollen Figure 3.Figure 3: Loss of muscle fibers from necrotic myopathy attributed to weakness caused by rhabdomyolysis.Seizures One may suspect that the circumstances surrounding critical illness make patients considerably more vulnerable to seizures, but generalized tonic-clonic seizures are uncommon in the intensive care unit. Myoclonic jerks may be more common because of their association with many of the drugs, such as ketamine and lidocaine, administered in the medical intensive care unit. Acute metabolic alterations, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and multiple drug regimens are precipitating factors. Two studies assessing seizures in the intensive care unit have been published [1,48]. In a two-year prospective study of neurologic complications in 1758 patients, 34 had simple partial seizures, 6 had complex partial seizures, and 20 had seizures that were generalized at onset. Status epilepticus eventually developed in six patients [1]. Most of these patients had a stroke or an infectious disease at the time of seizure. In a recent study from the Mayo Clinic covering nine years, 213 of 27,723 patients (0.8%) admitted to intensive care units had at least one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure during their stay in a unit [48]. Of the 213 patients, 103 had a history of seizures, 20 had abused alcohol or drugs, 8 were recovering from organ transplantation, and 27 had surgical trauma or head injury. In the remaining 55 patients, seizures were new in onset. Drug-associated seizures in the intensive care unit are often the result of toxicity [2]. Some antibiotics particularly lower the threshold for seizures, but renal failure or a recent sudden increase in antibiotic dosage is a more common precipitating event. For example, imipenem, but particularly increased levels of cilastatin, rather than the active antibiotic, is a well-known cause of seizures. Drugs associated with seizures in intensive care units are summarized in Table 3.Table 3: Drugs Associated with Seizures in the Intensive Care UnitSeizures associated with drug withdrawal may occur in one third of the patients. In a recent study that specifically addressed new-onset seizures, 18 of 55 patients had seizures associated with drug withdrawal (mostly narcotic analgesics) [48]. Drug toxicity was comparatively uncommon, observed in eight patients (from documented antibiotic toxicity in five and from antiarrhythmic drugs in three). In many narcotics were administered for pain management, and in all patients, moderate doses were repeated intramuscularly for at least one week. Seizures occurred two to four days after sudden withdrawal of narcotics. In patients who have alcohol-related seizures, most of which occur in those with a history of heavy drinking, diagnosis is difficult [49]. Very frequently, a single seizure, almost always self-limiting, develops in these patients, but delirium tremens may follow [49]. An underlying structural lesion needs to be excluded by cranial computed tomographic scan [50]. Benzodiazepines are frequently used to maintain sedation in mechanically ventilated patients. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus may occur after discontinuation of long-term administration of benzodiazepines [51]. Metabolic disorders increase the risk of seizures, but risk is related to the severity of the derangement [52-55]. The risk of seizures developing due to electrolyte abnormalities is low. Most seizures in the intensive care unit occur in patients with postoperative hyponatremia, and the cause is often iatrogenic. Most patients with severe hyponatremia already have an impaired level of consciousness, which is soon followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A very unusual syndrome associated with postoperative hyponatremia in young, healthy women has been described [52]. Arieff [52] and others are credited for their description of very severe hyponatremia in healthy women after elective surgery, but this complication was not found in a recent survey at the Mayo Clinic [55]. Many of these women had excessive administration of free water, resulting in sodium levels of less than 110 mEq/L. Vomiting, most likely associated with narcotics or postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, may also have contributed. All patients had grand mal seizures followed within one hour by respiratory arrest. Many remained in a vegetative state, and several patients became brain dead. More hospital surveys are necessary to delineate the prevalence of this catastrophic syndrome. Postoperative severe hyponatremia occurs in men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, but the outcome is good despite seizures [56]. In this category of patients, serum osmolarity is high from bladder absorption of hypertonic glycine, which is frequently used as an irrigant. Rapid excretion of glycine by the kidney restores plasma osmolarity. This result suggests that the changes in osmolarity are much more important than a change in plasma sodium and that differences should not be attributed to sex. Hypoglycemia may cause tonic-clonic seizures, but in one of the largest series of patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia, many were known to have epilepsy or were alcoholics [54]. Focal seizures may occur and do not necessarily implicate a preexisting structural lesion. Seizures are more prevalent in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia [53]. Nonketotic hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia may eventually result in refractory status epilepticus, usually with poor outcome. Tonic-clonic seizures may occur when the ionized serum calcium concentration is less than 3 mEq/L. Hypocalcemia in a critically ill patient is usually associated with radical neck dissection surgery but may also result from parathyroid suppression by sepsis, pancreatitis, aminoglycosides, or changes in serum magnesium [57]. Much more commonly, hypocalcemic patients have muscle cramps and irregular twitching, which should not be interpreted as focal seizures. Seizures in patients with transplanted organs often indicate that the immunosuppressive drug has reached toxic levels [58]. In patients with transplanted livers, the incidence of seizures is increased by cyclosporine, OKT3, or FK 506 toxicity Figure 4, ischemic anoxic encephalopathy, subdural hematoma, or fungal abscess [59,60].Figure 4: Upper left panel, Magnetic resonance imaging findings in a patient with seizures and FK 506 toxicity. Note marked hyperintensity signal in the globus pallidus on T1-weighted images, typically seen in patients with advanced liver disease. Upper right panel, Marked hyperintensity signal in white matter and cortex in occipital lobe appears on T2-weighted images in a patient with seizures and an impaired level of consciousness. Lower panels, There was complete resolution of both abnormalities in one month.Conclusion The management plan is often reassessed when additional neurologic injury develops in patients in intensive care units. In some patients with a severe underlying illness, an acute neurologic event is a final complication; in others, it is a temporary setback. The outcome from neurologic complications can be quite favorable, but signs of poor prognosis should be identified early and taken into account when management decisions are made. The clinical spectrum of the neurologic aspects of critical illness is beginning to emerge and become defined.",

      "abstract": "Critically ill patients are at risk for neurologic complications [1,2]. Many of these complications are part of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; others are simply manifestations of a more fulminant disease process. Neurologic complications may put an end to the expectation of full recovery, and outcome is often poor. Neurologic complications in critically ill patients were found in 12% of 175 consecutively studied patients in a medical intensive care unit, but they are likely to be even more prevalent in trauma and transplant units. Patients in whom neurologic complications develop during critical illness have twice the length of stay and are twice as likely to die [1]. Neurologic assessment in the intensive care unit is limited because many patients are fatigued, sleep-deprived, confused, uncooperative, or heavily sedated and are often treated with neuromuscular blocking drugs. There are large gaps in our knowledge of neurologic complications in critically ill patients. Neurologic complications often revolve around three main disturbances: muscle weakness, impaired consciousness, and seizures. This review describes common clinical neurologic complications of a potentially life-threatening illness. Coma or Failure to Awaken A puzzling clinical situation is the failure of patients to awaken after the critical illness has subsided. Familiar to intensive care specialists is the patient receiving mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure who does not fully recover to a normal level of consciousness after withdrawal of analgesics, sedatives, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. Neurologic signs typically associated with metabolic encephalopathy, such as multifocal myoclonus, asterixis, and tremor, are absent. The differential diagnosis in these patients is shown in Table 1. Despite the use of new short-acting pharmacologic drugs, a common cause of altered consciousness in critically ill patients is related to the previous administration of sedative drugs that have accumulated over days because of diminished clearance or pharmacologic interaction. In many other patients, an anoxic-ischemic insult from brief but significant hypoxemia or hypotension may produce a diffuse encephalopathy that lingers for weeks.Table 1: Major Causes of Coma in Intensive Care UnitsIn medical intensive care units, failure to awaken often occurs in association with sepsis [3,4]. The central nervous system manifestations in sepsis have not been studied in great detail. Patients with acute confusional episodes or any other persistent cognitive abnormality have been said to have \"septic encephalopathy.\" Whether a distinct metabolic encephalopathy of sepsis exists after exclusion of confounding factors remains unknown. In progressive multiple organ dysfunction from sepsis, severe hypoglycemia, marked hypotension necessitating increasing doses of inotropic medication, and significant hypercapnia may all contribute to impairment of consciousness. Suggested mechanisms for encephalopathy associated with sepsis are decreased cerebral blood flow with similar changes in cerebral extraction ratios, disordered amino acid transport similar to hepatic encephalopathy, microabscesses, and possibly, sustained hypotension, suggesting that septic encephalopathy may be more hypoxemic-ischemic in nature [2]. Whether cytokines, such as interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor, directly influence arousal remains unresolved. Other mimicking clinical conditions, such as multiple small intracranial hematomas, should be excluded and may be found as part of disseminated intravascular coagulation [5]. Outcome of patients with septic encephalopathy who remain in coma is poor [4,6]. A possibly underrecognized cause of coma after any type of critical illness is cholesterol embolization. Recent arteriographic procedures may be implicated [7,8]. In a retrospective review of pathologic material from patients who died six months after vascular catheterization, the incidence of cholesterol embolization was 25%, with embolization to the central nervous system in 5% of the patients [8]. The clinical recognition of neurologic manifestations of cholesterol embolization may be difficult, and the signs of diffuse encephalopathy, retinal hemorrhages, and transient hemiparesis are not specific. The positive predictive value of systemic manifestations, such as livedo reticularis, purple toes, renal failure, and muscle weakness, may be higher [8]. Both muscle and renal biopsy specimens may show stacked, needle-shaped crystals. It has been suggested that muscle biopsy has a high sensitivity for demonstrating cholesterol embolization [8]. By comparison, a frequent cause of coma in a surgical intensive care unit is acute renal failure producing acute uremic encephalopathy. Acute uremia occurs in approximately 20% of surgical critically ill patients; conversely, acute dialysis in the hospital is associated with perioperative acute renal failure [9,10]. Valvular heart surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting, and aortic aneurysm surgery typically are associated with postoperative acute renal failure, but the incidence is also high in liver transplantation [11,12] and in major surgical repairs complicated by sepsis or involving significant abdominal gastrointestinal exploration and repair.

Many patients die hours after onset [13,14]. In surgical intensive care units, failure to awaken can be associated with ischemic strokes in multiple arterial territories. This devastating complication frequently occurs after major cardiovascular repairs [15]. Patients in coma from ischemic strokes immediately after surgery often have had a significant perioperative event. Typically, the level of consciousness fails to improve after washout of high doses of narcotic analgesics and anesthetics. In these patients, a brief but significant hypotensive episode may have been noted during surgery, but the anatomical territories of ischemic stroke, often multiple, in these patients do not fit a typical watershed territory Figure 1.

An underlying neurologic abnormality should be considered when the patient is mobilized in a chair but appears considerably weak, when the patient cannot support weight, or when weaning failure cannot be readily explained by previous lung disease or new lung injury. At least three major categories have been recognized: axonal polyneuropathy (critical illness polyneuropathy), typically associated with sepsis; acute steroid myopathy, potentially associated with use of neuromuscular junction blockers; and an as yet undefined prolonged muscle weakness after neuromuscular junction blockers, which may represent a toxic myopathy. (The results of electromyographic and nerve conduction studies are often normal.) The definition of all these syndromes continues to be confusing. Many other possibilities should be considered, and in some patients a previously undiagnosed neurologic disorder may have been present that initially appeared with respiratory failure. The differential diagnoses to be considered in patients in medical and surgical intensive care units are listed in Table 2.Table 2: Causes of Generalized WeaknessaProspective studies of causes of weakness in the intensive care unit are few. Polyneuropathy is most commonly a cause of generalized weakness in the intensive care unit (\"critical illness polyneuropathy\") [37]. The prevalence in intensive care units is not exactly known, but it may occur in 5%-20% of all patients with sepsis and in 50% of patients remaining in the unit more than two weeks [38-40]. Polyneuropathy of critical illness is often seen in association with sepsis. Factors associated with this type of polyneuropathy include age, extended stay in the intensive care unit, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglycemia. The clinical features of critical illness polyneuropathy are normal cranial nerve findings, although grimacing may be weak [37,38]. Limb weakness is usually severe and more prominent in the distal distribution. Areflexia is invariably present. Prominent muscle wasting may be observed. Pinprick is usually diminished in a stocking-glove pattern. The disorder resolves in a stereotypical manner: improvement in the upper and proximal portions of the lower limbs is followed by successful weaning and later recovery of the distal muscles of the lower limbs. Outcome is generally good if the patient survives the critical illness [37]. As expected with axonal regeneration, three to four months is needed for improvement. A recent study found a severe residual functional handicap in 20% of seven-year survivors with polyneuropathy [39]. Some patients have persistent weakness of the foot flexors from entrapment neuropathy of the peroneal nerve [37]. Compression neuropathy of the peroneal nerve may occur when paralyzed limbs are everted. Trochanter rolls can prevent this unnecessary complication. Electrophysiologic studies in critical illness polyneuropathy may show typical features of axonal damage, with low amplitudes of compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials, widespread fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves, but nerve conduction velocities are perserved [41]. Phrenic nerve conduction is often absent [37,38]. Autopsy or sural nerve biopsy specimens show severe axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves, mostly in the distal segments. Another important cause of generalized muscle weakness is the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs, particularly pancuronium and vecuronium. Most patients recover within days after administration is discontinued, but some remain weak for weeks. The mechanism of weakness is unresolved. Careful, repeated studies of the neuromuscular junction have not been done, and findings may be normal despite marked limb weakness. A recent prospective study found that metabolites of vecuronium may accumulate in patients with renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hypermagnesemia [42]. Electrophysiologic data for these patients with prolonged weakness were not available. Complete recovery can be expected [42]. The prevalence of prolonged weakness is low; a recent report noted the occurrence in only 1 of 58 prospectively studied patients. It is unclear whether monitoring with a peripheral nerve stimulator can prevent this complication [43]. A well-recognized but uncommon complication of intravenously administered neuromuscular blocking drugs is acute necrotic myopathy, possibly when the drug is given in combination with large doses of corticosteroids (usually up to 1 g/d) [44,45]. The typical patient in whom the complication occurs has status asthmaticus. Significant loss of myosin has been reported [45]. The outcome appears to be excellent, but data are limited. Recently, a myopathy was described in lung transplant patients. Muscle biopsy revealed loss of myosin. All patients received large doses of corticosteroids but no neuromuscular blocking agents, and sepsis did not develop. Normal creatine kinase levels virtually excluded rhabdomyolysis as a possibility. The underlying cause of this selective loss of myosin is unclear, nor is it clear whether this represents a new syndrome or a variant of acute steroid myopathy [46]. We found that severe necrotic myopathy was more common than polyneuropathy in liver transplant patients but were unable to further delineate the abnormality [47]. Rhabdomyolysis may be a source of weakness in critically ill patients. The most common causes are trauma, ischemia of large muscle compartments from arterial occlusion, and sepsis. Myoglobinuria can be found when rhabdomyolysis is massive. Many patients have considerable weakness and pain. Biceps, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles are tender on palpation and may appear swollen Figure 3.Figure 3: Loss of muscle fibers from necrotic myopathy attributed to weakness caused by rhabdomyolysis.Seizures One may suspect that the circumstances surrounding critical illness make patients considerably more vulnerable to seizures, but generalized tonic-clonic seizures are uncommon in the intensive care unit. Myoclonic jerks may be more common because of their association with many of the drugs, such as ketamine and lidocaine, administered in the medical intensive care unit. Acute metabolic alterations, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and multiple drug regimens are precipitating factors. Two studies assessing seizures in the intensive care unit have been published [1,48]. In a two-year prospective study of neurologic complications in 1758 patients, 34 had simple partial seizures, 6 had complex partial seizures, and 20 had seizures that were generalized at onset. Status epilepticus eventually developed in six patients [1]. Most of these patients had a stroke or an infectious disease at the time of seizure. In a recent study from the Mayo Clinic covering nine years, 213 of 27,723 patients (0.8%) admitted to intensive care units had at least one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure during their stay in a unit [48]. Of the 213 patients, 103 had a history of seizures, 20 had abused alcohol or drugs, 8 were recovering from organ transplantation, and 27 had surgical trauma or head injury. In the remaining 55 patients, seizures were new in onset. Drug-associated seizures in the intensive care unit are often the result of toxicity [2]. Some antibiotics particularly lower the threshold for seizures, but renal failure or a recent sudden increase in antibiotic dosage is a more common precipitating event. For example, imipenem, but particularly increased levels of cilastatin, rather than the active antibiotic, is a well-known cause of seizures. Drugs associated with seizures in intensive care units are summarized in Table 3.Table 3: Drugs Associated with Seizures in the Intensive Care UnitSeizures associated with drug withdrawal may occur in one third of the patients. In a recent study that specifically addressed new-onset seizures, 18 of 55 patients had seizures associated with drug withdrawal (mostly narcotic analgesics) [48]. Drug toxicity was comparatively uncommon, observed in eight patients (from documented antibiotic toxicity in five and from antiarrhythmic drugs in three). In many narcotics were administered for pain management, and in all patients, moderate doses were repeated intramuscularly for at least one week. Seizures occurred two to four days after sudden withdrawal of narcotics. In patients who have alcohol-related seizures, most of which occur in those with a history of heavy drinking, diagnosis is difficult [49]. Very frequently, a single seizure, almost always self-limiting, develops in these patients, but delirium tremens may follow [49]. An underlying structural lesion needs to be excluded by cranial computed tomographic scan [50]. Benzodiazepines are frequently used to maintain sedation in mechanically ventilated patients. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus may occur after discontinuation of long-term administration of benzodiazepines [51]. Metabolic disorders increase the risk of seizures, but risk is related to the severity of the derangement [52-55]. The risk of seizures developing due to electrolyte abnormalities is low. Most seizures in the intensive care unit occur in patients with postoperative hyponatremia, and the cause is often iatrogenic. Most patients with severe hyponatremia already have an impaired level of consciousness, which is soon followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A very unusual syndrome associated with postoperative hyponatremia in young, healthy women has been described [52]. Arieff [52] and others are credited for their description of very severe hyponatremia in healthy women after elective surgery, but this complication was not found in a recent survey at the Mayo Clinic [55]. Many of these women had excessive administration of free water, resulting in sodium levels of less than 110 mEq/L. Vomiting, most likely associated with narcotics or postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, may also have contributed. All patients had grand mal seizures followed within one hour by respiratory arrest. Many remained in a vegetative state, and several patients became brain dead. More hospital surveys are necessary to delineate the prevalence of this catastrophic syndrome. Postoperative severe hyponatremia occurs in men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, but the outcome is good despite seizures [56]. In this category of patients, serum osmolarity is high from bladder absorption of hypertonic glycine, which is frequently used as an irrigant. Rapid excretion of glycine by the kidney restores plasma osmolarity. This result suggests that the changes in osmolarity are much more important than a change in plasma sodium and that differences should not be attributed to sex. Hypoglycemia may cause tonic-clonic seizures, but in one of the largest series of patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia, many were known to have epilepsy or were alcoholics [54]. Focal seizures may occur and do not necessarily implicate a preexisting structural lesion. Seizures are more prevalent in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia [53]. Nonketotic hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia may eventually result in refractory status epilepticus, usually with poor outcome. Tonic-clonic seizures may occur when the ionized serum calcium concentration is less than 3 mEq/L. Hypocalcemia in a critically ill patient is usually associated with radical neck dissection surgery but may also result from parathyroid suppression by sepsis, pancreatitis, aminoglycosides, or changes in serum magnesium [57]. Much more commonly, hypocalcemic patients have muscle cramps and irregular twitching, which should not be interpreted as focal seizures. Seizures in patients with transplanted organs often indicate that the immunosuppressive drug has reached toxic levels [58]. In patients with transplanted livers, the incidence of seizures is increased by cyclosporine, OKT3, or FK 506 toxicity Figure 4, ischemic anoxic encephalopathy, subdural hematoma, or fungal abscess [59,60].Figure 4: Upper left panel, Magnetic resonance imaging findings in a patient with seizures and FK 506 toxicity. Note marked hyperintensity signal in the globus pallidus on T1-weighted images, typically seen in patients with advanced liver disease. Upper right panel, Marked hyperintensity signal in white matter and cortex in occipital lobe appears on T2-weighted images in a patient with seizures and an impaired level of consciousness. Lower panels, There was complete resolution of both abnormalities in one month.Conclusion The management plan is often reassessed when additional neurologic injury develops in patients in intensive care units. In some patients with a severe underlying illness, an acute neurologic event is a final complication; in others, it is a temporary setback. The outcome from neurologic complications can be quite favorable, but signs of poor prognosis should be identified early and taken into account when management decisions are made. The clinical spectrum of the neurologic aspects of critical illness is beginning to emerge and become defined.",

Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.",

It is recognized as feelings of being worn-out, tired, lethargic, and irritable, with fuzzy thinking and difficulty in getting going. When it occurs, it tends to last for an average of 4.4 hr. This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great. These data suggest the testable hypothesis that optimal durations of sleep fall into a relatively narrow band and that disruptive psycho-physiological effects are sustained with both too much and too little sleep.",

Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in general have been associated with poor job performance, anxiety, difficulties in personal relations, and an increased risk for fatal and nonfatal automobile accidents, daytime sleepiness resulting from chronic partial or total sleep deprivation has been demonstrated to result in neurocognitive deficits and alterations in mood, and more recently to cause alterations in physiological and endocrine functions (4–26).

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Social phobia is one of the most frequent psychiatric disorders, with a lifetime prevalence rate of about 3-5%. The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

      "abstract": "Depression is increasingly prevalent in Western countries. It has severe consequences and is associated with increased rates of disability, morbidity, and mortality. Despite numerous therapeutic options, a great number of depressed patients do not achieve full remission. In addition, despite good short-term outcomes, long-term therapeutic results remain disappointing and associated with a poor prognosis, raising significant concern in terms of public health. Impaired sleep – especially insomnia – may be at least partly responsible for this problem. Very close relationships between major depressive disorder (MDD) and sleep disorders have been observed. In particular, residual symptoms of sleep disturbance in a remitted patient may predict a relapse of the disease. However, most currently available antidepressants do not always take into consideration the sleep disturbances of depressed patients; some agents long used in clinical practice even appear to worsen them by their sleep-inhibiting properties. But some other new medications were shown to relieve early sleep disturbance in addition to alleviating other depression-related symptoms. This positive impact should promote compliance with medication and psychological treatments, and increase daytime performance and overall functioning. Complete remission of MDD appears therefore to depend on the relief of sleep disturbances, a core symptom of MDD that should be taken into consideration and treated early in depressed patients.",

      "title": "Sleep related vehicle accidents: some guides for road safety policies",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related vehicle accidents (SRVAs) are a common form of highway accident, often wrongly attributed to other causes. SRVAs typically involve running off the road or into the back of another vehicle, with no braking beforehand. Because of a high impact speed these accidents are often serious. SRVAs peak around 02:00h-06:00h and 14:00h-16:00h, when daily sleepiness is naturally higher. Hence, time of day is a critical factor, as important as the duration of the drive. Most SRVAs are not due to sleep pathology. Many are work-related. Non-sleeping rest is no substitute for sleep. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning, and is preceded by feelings of increasing sleepiness of which drivers are quite aware. Driving impairment is usually worse than is realised by the sleepy driver. The best countermeasure is sleep, or even a short nap. Even more effective is the combination of a nap with caffeine.",

      "abstract": "Drivers' sleepiness and falling asleep while driving account for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents (studies show different results from 1% to 30%). Sleepiness is rarely well recognised as a causing factor of traffic accidents. 2.5% up to 20% people suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep deprivation as its most frequent cause. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and medical problems--especially sleep disturbances. The sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) has been identified as the most common cause of habitual drowsy driving. Patients with SAS (apart from other health problems) are 6 times more likely to have accidents. After adequate treatment of severe SAS with continuous positive airway pressure the risk of accident lowered 5 x. Other important sleep disturbances include chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement in sleep. Sleepiness was described in Parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy, in chronic cardiacs and in people with complex internal health problems. Regular or single intake of drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others) can itself induce sleep problems. Sleepiness in persons without sleep disorder may occur due to preventable causes such as poor sleep habits which lead to sleep deprivation.",

Partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night and phase-advance of the sleep-wake cycle induce temporary clinical remission: these experiments indicate that abnormally advanced rhythms are not merely an epiphenomenon but play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. They lead to the hypothesis that depression occurs in susceptible individuals when a sleep-sensitive phase of the circadian system becomes advanced from the first hours of waking into the last hours of sleep and interacts with sleep to cause depression.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "title": "Specific Phobias",
      "abstract": "Specific phobias (also referred to as simple phobias and isolated phobias) represent a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by excessive and/or irrational fear of one of relatively few and usually related objects, situations, places, phenomena, or activities (phobic stimuli). The phobic stimuli are either avoided or endured with intense anxiety or discomfort. People with specific phobias are aware that their fear is unreasonable, but this does not diminish the intensity of the fear. Rather, they are quite distressed about being afraid or feel handicapped by their phobia. Specific phobias are frequently encountered in the general population, but they are relatively uncommon in the clinical setting. Most phobias have a remarkable tendency to persist, prompting an assumption that they cannot be easily extinguished because of their ‘‘purpose’’ to protect against danger. Specific phobias are deceptively simple, as they are easy to describe and recognize but often difficult to understand. There are several conceptual problems and a number of issues associated with specific phobias:… 1. Where are the boundaries of specific phobias? How can we develop better criteria on the basis of which specific phobia could be distinguished as a psychiatric disorder from fears and avoidance considered to be within the realm of ‘‘normality?’’ 2. How can specific phobias be taken seriously by both the sufferers and clinicians? 3. In view of the considerable differences between various types of specific phobias, should they continue to be grouped together? 4. Should specific phobias be grouped on the basis of whether they are driven by fear or disgust? 5. In view of its unique features, should the blood-injection-injury type of specific phobia be given a separate psychopathological, diagnostic, and nosological status? 6. Considering a significant overlap between situational phobias and agoraphobia, should they be grouped together, along a hypothetical situational phobia/agoraphobia spectrum? 7. What is the relationship between specific phobias and other psychopathology? Are they relatively isolated from other disorders, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, or should they more appropriately be conceptualized as a predisposition to or a risk factor for some psychiatric conditions? 8. How specific are pathways that lead to specific phobias? 9. Has the dominant treatment model for specific phobias, based on exposure therapy, exhausted its potential? Is the tendency for specific phobias to persist adequately addressed by treatments derived from learning theory?",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a very frequent complaint /periodically or permanently it affects about 35% of the population/ and is a serious sociological problem. This term covers at least four types of sleep disorders: difficult falling asleep, frequent awakening, too early awakening and impairment of sleep quality--sleep quantitatively sufficient but failing to produce a feeling of rest. Insomnia may be sporadic, short-lasting and chronic. The last type requires particularly medical assistance since impairment of sleep quality can lead to drug dependence. In every case of insomnia it should be tried to explain its cause /neurosis, depression, somatic diseases with symptoms leading to sleep disturbances, toxic factors such as alcohol, drugs, inappropriate sleep hygiene etc./. In the treatment the basic role is played by removal of causes and better observation of sleep hygiene. Hypnotic drugs are indicated in sporadic and short-lasting insomnia, but in chronic insomnia they should be used cautiously and not continuously. Barbiturates have been abandoned recently and benzodiazepines have replaced them. They are, however, fraught with numerous faults. Cyclopyrolones /Zolpidem, Zopiklon/ are the new generation of hypnotic drugs in which the negative features of benzodiazepines have been partly excluded. Their half-life is short, they cause no rebound effect, adverse effects are better tolerated and are less frequent, drug dependence is not produced.",

      "abstract": "Typologies of sleep problems have usually relied on identifying underlying causes or symptom clusters. In this study the value of using the patient's own reasons for sleep disturbance are explored. Using secondary data analysis of a nationally representative psychiatric survey the patterning of the various reasons respondents provided for self-reported sleep problems were examined. Over two thirds (69.3%) of respondents could identify a specific reason for their sleep problem with worry (37.9%) and illness (20.1%) representing the most commonly reported reasons. And while women reported more sleep problems for almost every reason compared with men, the patterning of reasons by age showed marked variability. Sleep problem symptoms such as difficulty getting to sleep or waking early also showed variability by different reasons as did the association with major correlates such as worry, depression, anxiety and poor health. While prevalence surveys of 'insomnia' or 'poor sleep' often assume the identification of an underlying homogeneous construct there may be grounds for recognising the existence of different sleep problem types particularly in the context of the patient's perceived reason for the problem.",

      "title": "Relationship between the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and reports of anomalous experiences.",
      "abstract": "A whole range of anomalous experiences (1) has been reported during the hypnagogic or hypnopompic states that surround periods of sleep. It is not uncommon for people to experience brief, vivid, and often strange imagery or to find themselves temporarily unable to move or speak during these periods between wakefulness and sleep. These brief sensations and the temporary paralysis are known as hypnagogic or hypnopompic imagery and sleep paralysis, (2) respectively (American Sleep Disorders Association [ASDA], 1990). Recent surveys found that people who report more childhood experiences of hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery or sleep paralysis also report a greater number of anomalous experiences during childhood or adulthood (Sherwood, 1999, 2000). More specifically, hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery has been associated with reports of extrasensory perception (ESP), apparitions and communication with the dead, out-of-the-body experiences (OBEs), visions of past lives, and experiences involving extraterrestrials (e.g., Glicksohn, 1989; Gurney, Myers, & Podmore, 1886; Leaning, 1925; Mavromatis, 1983, 1987; McCreery, 1993; McKellar, 1957; Spanos, Cross, Dickson, & DuBreuil, 1993). In addition to the above anomalous experiences, sleep paralysis has also been associated with reports of psychokinesis (PK) and near-death experiences (NDEs) (Baker, 1992; Green & McCreery, 1994; Rose & Blackmore, 1996; Rose, Hogan, & Blackmore, 1997; Spanos et al., 1993; Spanos, McNulty, DuBreuil, Pires, & Burgess, 1995). The question is: are the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states conducive to anomalous processes and events or are normal hypnagogic/hypnopompic features being misinterpreted? Perhaps both statements are true? The aim of this article is to consider evidence for each of these possibilities. First, it is necessary to outline the characteristics of the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and the features of some of the experiences that can occur within them. CHARACTERISTICS OF HYPNAGOGIC/HYPNOPOMPIC STATES Most research, both experimental and survey-based, seems to have focused on the hypnagogic state (the period between wakefulness and sleep, i.e., just as a person is falling asleep). Comparatively little research has been carried out on the hypnopompic state (the period between sleep and wakefulness, i.e., just as a person is waking from sleep). Thus, this article focuses mainly on the hypnagogic state. The hypnagogic state, like the sleep state, is fairly complex and contains a number of steps and stages (Mavromatis, 1983; Rechtschaffen, 1994). Hori, Hayashi, and Morikawa (1994) concluded that the sleep onset period is unique and cannot be accurately categorised as either waking or sleeping. It is very difficult to determine the precise point of falling asleep, except by using arbitrary criteria, because the transition is gradual, because the changes are not always synchronised, and because there are large individual differences in when the changes occur (Lavie, 1996; Rechtschaffen, 1994). During alert wakefulness, eye movements are fairly rapid, and the normal EEC trace consists of irregular waves of high frequency (Bray, Cragg, Macknight, Mills, & Taylor, 1992). As a person relaxes or becomes drowsy, there is an increase in alpha activity (8-12 Hz), and eye movements become slower and less frequent (Parker, 1975; Rechtschaffen, 1994). In fact, the presence of slow eye movements is considered to be an extremely accurate indicator of hypnagogic mentation (Schacter, 1976). Stickgold and Hobson (1994) found that as the period of eyelid movement quiescence lengthens, that is, as the eyelids move less, mentation becomes more dreamlike. This contrasts with the positive association between eyelid movements and dreamlike mentation during REM sleep. As a person passes through the hypnagogic period into the early stages of non-REM sleep, there is a decline in alpha activity and a concomitant increase in slower theta activity (4-7 Hz; Baddia, Wright, & Wauquier, 1994; Bray et al. …",

Individual population age 60 years or older, sampling probability proportional to size, consist of case group that is experiencing sleep disturbance (n=165) and control group (n=330). Respondent sleep disturbance affective disorder 23.6%. There is a significant relationship of sleep disorders to affective disorders. Sleep disorders at risk 2.47 times affective disorder. Sleep disorders can be insomnia, awakening at night or waking up too early which can lead to psychological disorders such as psychological disorders such as anger, unstable emotions, sadness, distress, anxiety is also a physical disorder such as pain in the body. If not immediately addressed can continue to occur depression and even threaten psychiatric disorders. Further research needs to be done to overcome sleep disorders in the elderly.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Depression is recognised as the most common mental health disorder in the elderly. It does not only increase the morbidity, but it increases the mortality as well. Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

      "title": "Sleep in Adults: Insomnia.",
      "abstract": "Sleep insufficiency, insomnia, and related sleep disorders are concerns that affect millions of US adults. The disorders also contribute to significant cognitive, emotional, and physical health challenges. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the US population. It is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early-morning waking and is linked to daytime distress and impairment. Common sleep disruptors include environmental factors such as noise, light, and air pollution and also personal habits such as excessive screen use before bedtime. Evaluating patients with insomnia in primary care requires integrating sleep health assessments into routine visits and use of insomnia screening tools and sleep diaries for accurate diagnosis. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia are the preferred treatments. Pharmacotherapy or combination therapy (with cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia and pharmacotherapy) may be considered when these interventions are ineffective. Family physicians should weigh the risks and benefits of insomnia medication use carefully for all patients but especially for older adults because of potential adverse effects. Managing insomnia effectively in primary care involves a comprehensive approach, prioritizing nonpharmacologic strategies, regular monitoring, and patient-centered care.",

Polysomnographie studies are increasingly able to capture samples of disordered sleep, are often the only route to a definitive diagnosis, and, because of the overlapping presentations of parasomnias, are recommended even when the clinical presentation strongly suggests a particular diagnosis. In this chapter, the authors review those parasomnias that may resemble a seizure disorder, with special attention to treatment. Classical childhood somnambulism is characterized by sleepwalking episodes, which usually occur in deep non-REM sleep. Typically, sleepwalking in children is a self-limited, developmental phenomenon without attendant somatic illness or psychopathology. A family history of sleepwalking or night terrors is usual, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Night terrors are believed to represent the far end of a continuum which includes sleeptalking and somnambulism.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related painful erections (SRPE) are characterized by penile pain occurring during nocturnal erections, without apparent penile pathology. Sleep loss caused by the disorder may result in severe anxiety, mood disorders, irritability, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Until now, the phenomenon of SRPE has not been well understood. The rarity of the published cases probably does not reflect the actual prevalence, which is presumably over 1 percent. Because of the bizarre nature of the complaints, patients are often referred to a psychiatrist. The authors present the case of a 69-year-old patient, who, during frequent nocturnal awakenings, experienced hard-to-define burning, tingling sensations in symmetric hypogastric localisation. Sometimes the skin of both legs, and, occasionally, the arms and hands was involved, too. Initially, however, no definite erection-associated penile pain was present. Micturating quite a small amount just after awakening consistently resulted in immediate and complete relief. After two years, painful nocturnal erections reoccurring at stable intervals of 90–120 minutes during sleep developed to be the leading complaint. In default of urological or gastroenterological pathology, the patient has been referred to a psychiatrist. Quite futilely, mianserin and alprazolam, later sertralin and carbamazepine, respectively, were administered. Clozapine has also been tried out; however, it has to be rejected due to some adverse effects. Finally, 10 mg baclofen in the evening resulted in complete and permanent remission. This is consonant with the literature data stating that only clonazepam, baclofen and clozapine are likely to have long term beneficial effects in SRPE.",

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

      "abstract": "The term \"depression\" is used to describe a normal mood, a medical symptom, and a collection of psychiatric symptoms. As a normal mood, depression is a common human reaction to a significant loss; as a medical term, it is also used to describe the sadness seen in patients who have other severe medical and psychiatric disorders. Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses. The first proposes that affective disorders result from functional changes in the central noradrenergic systems. The second postulates that the primary abnormality is in central serotonergic pathways. These two hypotheses are supported by the pharmacological effects of antidepressant drugs.",

      "title": "Pharmacologic Treatment of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

Studies of this problem explicitly show that the loss of the job exerts a detrimental health effect. A number of other factors decide about the significance of this relationship. The change from being employed to unemployment affects mostly mental health. First symptoms appear together with the danger of losing the job. Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor. Many authors turn particular attention to a growing intensity of all negative effects of unemployment if it lasts for a long period of time.",

      "abstract": "It is known that sleep disorders adversely affect the processes of brain neuroplasticity. Wakefulness and night sleep are functional states that are closely interrelated and equally mediate and provide the adaptive activity of the individual. Human biological rhythms are hierarchically dependent on the main pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The role of a mediator that delivers regulatory signals to organs is played by the hormone melatonin, which is synthesized by pineal gland cells. Sleep disorders seriously affect a person's quality of life: emotional stress, anxiety, irritation increase and, as a result, stress resistance decreases, the need for communication, entertainment decreases. In the vast majority of cases, insomnia is secondary, that is, it is formed against the background of the development of diseases and/or adverse circumstances. Quite often, sleep disturbances occur in demyelinating/ neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. We examined 30 patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, which were divided into two groups. The main group received therapy with a melatonin- containing drug in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy. Patients in the control group received only therapy with melatonin-containing drug. It was shown that cortisol levels in patients of the main group decreased more than in patients who did not receive CBT. Reduction of clinical manifestations, along with improvements in laboratory indices of day and night melatonin expression, as well as cortisol expression, were already observed on the 14th day of treatment, and on the 21st day of the study, these indices improved significantly. Clinical efficacy in the main group was achieved in 86,6 % of cases, in the control group - in 60,0 % of cases. It is planned to use this method in the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation program in patients with neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu.

      "title": "Assessing the symptoms associated with excited delirium syndrome and the use of conducted energy weapons",
      "abstract": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) has been defined as the sudden death of an individual involving an acute (minutes to hours) transient disturbance in consciousness and cognition, marked by disorientation, disorganized and inconsistent thought processes, inability to distinguish reality from hallucinations, disturbances in speech, disorientation to time and place, and misidentification of individuals. 1 In a majority of these deaths the individual exhibited violent behaviors, struggled with police, correction officers, or medical personnel during control and physical restraint of the person, within a matter of several minutes after the cessation of the struggle the person is observed to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation is usually unsuccessful.Frequently an autopsy does not reveal anatomic evidence to show trauma or natural disease or toxicological findings sufficient to explain the death.Commonly, pathologists cite the symptoms of ExDS on the death certificate as contributing factors of the death. 2-4Deaths associated with ExDS were first reported in a case report in 1849 when psychiatrist Dr. Luther Bell at the McClean Asylum for the Insane in Massachusetts described the condition of 40 mentally ill patients who died from a fatal new disease. 5Common features observed in these patient's deaths included: fever, rapid pulse, increasing confusion, loss of appetite and sleep, mania, and violent behaviors.Patients condition deteriorated over several weeks before dying.The clinical condition was referred to as Bell's Mania or acute exhaustive mania and is considered the forerunner of the syndrome of ExDS. 1,2,4,6Other case reports described similar symptoms of Bell's Mania and were referred to as acute delirious mania, lethal catatonia, acute psychotic furors exhaustive syndrome, and typhoma.As new antipsychotic medications emerged through the 1950s, the incidence of deaths associated with Bell's Mania declined.By the mid-1980s a number of deaths associated with cocaine use were reported by Fishbain and Wetli and they described symptoms associated with chronic stimulant abuse as excited delirium. 7Common factors observed in these deaths included: acute drug intoxication, mental illness, agitation, hyperactivity, violence, bizarre and self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and elevated body temperature.For years there has been a controversy as to a standardized case definition of ExDS.Case report and post-mortem literature since the 1990s has shown that ExDS comprises several clinical features including: delirium with agitation, hyperthermia, violent agitation, acute psychotic behavior, bizarre behaviors, profuse sweating, incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and endurance, lack of response to painful stimuli, hyperactivity, respiratory arrest, and",

Differentiating confusion, fear, or irritability following a seizure from a postictal psychosis requires careful history taking. Psychosis can also be the result of a comorbid illness; one should also consider potential causes such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The timing of symptoms is a key consideration when trying to determine if someone has a postictal psychosis. Postictal psychosis is classically preceded by a lucid interval, followed by a prolonged period of psychosis lasting more than 24 hours. Treatment with antipsychotic medications is often required. For many patients, antipsychotic medications can be discontinued once symptoms resolve.",

The commonest disorders are difficulty in getting to sleep and in staying asleep. With age, there is an increase in periodic leg movements and sleep apnea; the most relevant parasomnia is the behavior disorder associated with REM sleep. There are also a series of problems, which although not specific to the elderly, have a greater impact on them because of their effect on sleep: lack of adaptation to emotional upsets, poor sleep habits, psychiatric affective disorders, organic disorders, use of drugs (psychotropic or others), nocturnal agitation and falls. Finally, although the problem is recognized as important in medical practice, not all doctors have sufficient resources to satisfactorily treat sleep disorders in the elderly.",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

      "abstract": "The classical syndrome of delirium has an abrupt onset. In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

This group of parasomnias is composed of three disorders occurring essentially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleep paralysis is one of the main symptoms associated with narcolepsy, but it can also occur individually. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by a loss of generalized skeletal muscle REM-related atonia and the presence of physical dreamenactment. Polysomnographic recordings of individuals with RBD showed a reduction of the tonic phenomena of REM sleep and the activation of the phasic phenomena. Parasomnias are frequent in the general population; more than 30% of individuals experiences at least one type of parasomnia.

In this condition there is a loss of the normal atonia of postural muscles that usually occurs in REM sleep [2]. It results in complex, vigorous, dream-enacting behaviours during REM sleep [3].

The condition can manifest itself in several ways and can be triggered in different scenarios, facts that render it a peculiar and multifaceted clinical entity. Nosologically, insomnia can be understood as a symptom or as a disorder with its own characteristics and has a chronic course. Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

      "abstract": "Near-death experiences (NDEs) are profound psychic experiences commonly occurring in life-threatening conditions. They include feeling a sense of peace, of seeing a bright light, encountering deceased relatives or religious figures, and of transcending space and time. To explain them, it has been suggested that they stem from brain disorders and/or psychological reactions to approaching death, a sort of wishful thinking in response to the perceived threat. This is a report on a case with most of the features typical of NDEs except that it occurred entirely without any life-threatening conditions. This evidence is theoretically incompatible with either of the above hypotheses, suggesting that a broader interpretation of the phenomenon is needed.",

      "title": "Book: Insomnia: Principles and Management",
      "abstract": "Sleep—a state marked by lessened consciousness, lessened movement of the skeletal muscles, and slowed-down metabolism—has an essential restorative function and an important role in memory consolidation. It is an orchestrated neurochemical process involving sleep promoting and arousal centres in the brain. Sleep propensity depends on two main factors: the amount of accumulated sleep deprivation and the circadian clock phase enhancing sleep at night.​night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEds Martin P Szuba, Jacqueline D Kloss, David F Dinges\r\n\r\nCambridge University Press, £34.95, pp 306 ISBN 0 521 01076 4\r\n\r\nRating: ★★★★\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsomnia is a symptom, resulting from insufficient sleep or sleep of poor quality, with negative effects on subsequent daytime functioning. The prevalence of insomnia increases steeply during the fifth decade of life. People with insomnia often complain of impairments in attention, memory, or concentration, impairments in their mood, feeling depressed or irritable or anxious, and impairments in their ability to function at work, at home, or even at school. They generally have more medical complaints, seek medical care more often, and are more prone to road injuries than people without insomnia.\r\n\r\nAn enormous gap exists between the prevalence of insomnia and the actual management of people with the condition. While roughly 20% to 30% of adults worldwide get insomnia, less than 50% of them will be diagnosed as having the condition. Patients are hesitant to discuss insomnia with their doctors because they are afraid that their problem will be seen as trivial or indicate a serious illness. Doctors tend to trivialise insomnia because little of their medical training is devoted to it and because they are often unaware that the onset of insomnia may signal a serious condition or an established risk factor for psychiatric illness.\r\n\r\nInsomnia: Principles and Management announces the arrival of this complex sleep disorder at the frontiers of internal and sleep medicine. With contributions from highly prominent sleep specialists, this multi-authored volume captures the breadth of the field and introduces a diverse array of up-to-date scientific and clinical data ranging from the diagnosis, prevalence, aetiology, and management of insomnia to the neurobiology of sleep and arousal. It also provides several perspectives on related disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep disorders in sighted and blind subjects, jet lag, and mood disorders.\r\n\r\nThe book reviews the various approaches for the management of insomnia, including behavioural approaches, the use of hypnotic drugs aimed at treating sleep quantity deficits, and the use of chronobiotic drugs (biological clock effectors, such as melatonin and its analogues) to improve the circadian control of the sleep-wake cycle. If indeed melatonin plays a role in sleep regulation, either through its chronobiotic, soporific activities or both, we would expect that exogenous melatonin administration will be able to induce sleep during daytime or when the homeostatic drive to sleep is insufficient, and to improve sleep in cases where there is a deficiency in endogenous melatonin. This is indeed demonstrated in blind subjects, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and elderly patients with insomnia in whom melatonin production is diminished.\r\n\r\nAnother important contribution of this book is the effort to identify where research should be heading. In recent years, the focus of clinically oriented sleep medicine has shifted from sleep quantity to sleep quality, as quality rather than quantity is associated with impaired daytime functioning, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and poor quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis succinct and informative volume will be useful to both sleep experts and general practitioners alike.",

For those with PD, sleep is frequently disordered and this affects the waking day, including control of parkinsonism. Insomnia is a common problem in the general population and increases with aging. When we are young, we typically have no trouble getting adequate sleep. Teenagers left undisturbed on a Saturday morning will sleep till noon. As we age, getting to sleep or staying asleep often becomes increasingly difficult. Sometimes this relates to life stressors; lying in bed ruminating about the day’s events is a frequent cause of insomnia. Depression is a common human affliction and insomnia may be one symptom.

      "title": "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Unmasked through Recurrent Psychogenic Cough",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that develops following exposure to traumatic events such as actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, which one experiences, witnesses, or listens to.[1] Although the research into the concept and diagnosis of PTSD remains debatable, it typically manifests through reliving experiences, avoidance behavior toward trauma reminders, and hyperarousal. However, the new description of trauma itself has become fluid, with atypical and low magnitude experiences like watching an animation series or eating spoiled food are also equated to trauma.[2] Further, dissociation and somatization are reported in as much as 70% of cases of PTSD.[3] Furthermore, there are atypical manifestations of PTSD, especially in children, such as repetitive play involving traumatic events, sleep disturbances, self-blame, behavioral regression, and somatization.[4] This case highlights an unusual manifestation of PTSD, where a recurrent non-productive cough emerged as the predominant symptom in the absence of any identifiable organic pathology, a symptom currently not reported as a part of PTSD in the literature. While standard management includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), this report also supports the existing evidence for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in refractory PTSD,[5] which has not been useful in dissociative disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. This is the case of a 19-year-old male, currently studying for a diploma, who was first seen at the age of 13 (in 2019) in this hospital with complaints of abrupt episodes of fearfulness and palpitation with eventual loss of consciousness lasting for approximately half an hour. This was triggered by thoughts of traumatic events, of being beaten by his father's employer on one occasion, and bullying in school. It was accompanied by academic underperformance, disturbed sleep, and intermittent absenteeism from school. There were no obvious reliving experiences. His developmental milestones were reportedly normal. He was given a diagnosis of dissociative disorder and a differential diagnosis of PTSD. He was started on 2.5 mg of escitalopram per day. Subsequently, he was lost to follow-up. In August 2024, he was once again referred to our hospital with complaints of intense, non-productive coughing spells lasting about 1 h, associated at times with chest pain, palpitations, and anxiety. He was first evaluated by emergency medicine, cleared of organicity, and then referred to psychiatry. Further exploration revealed a history of repeated physical abuse by his father's employer using a belt or stick, that lasted for more than a year during 2021–2022. Both families stayed in the same compound, and the employer and his son would do this when his parents were away at work. This was because he was not good at studies. It was stopped later when his father reprimanded his employer. However, the patient started to get episodes of coughing as explained above. The local physician referred him to a psychiatrist who again started him on escitalopram 10 mg/day, but it was not effective this time. The patient was taken to another psychiatrist who gave him dothiepin 50 mg/day. As it was also ineffective, even after several months, he was referred to us. He was provisionally diagnosed as having a dissociative disorder. However, on serial mental status examination, it was revealed that whenever his class teacher yelled at or punished any student, this would remind him of the abuse that had happened to him at home, and he would start coughing for hours. It was as if he was being beaten up then and there. He would avoid any situation that involved yelling or any kind of abuse, as it would trigger such episodes. At school, he would remain vigilant of such events happening and used to have frequent absences. His diagnosis of PTSD as per International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) was confirmed, based on the history of trauma, reliving experiences expressed as cough, avoidance of the school environment that reminds him of trauma, and being vigilant when at school or wherever he perceives threats. He was started on desvenlafaxine, propranolol, and clonazepam, and the dose was built up to 150 mg, 40 mg, and 1 mg, in that order. Both the patient and his family were educated regarding the nature and course of the illness as well as the importance of adherence to treatment. The grounding techniques and relaxation techniques were taught to the patient. He was partially better and was discharged after 10 days. However, the patient reported with worsening of cough despite medication, in October 2024. Further increase in the dose of desvenlafaxine to 200 mg did not help, prompting consideration of rTMS. He underwent 20 sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, over 5 days, as per the evidence.[6] Following this, he showed rapid improvement in cough frequency, with alleviation of anxiety symptoms. He was discharged on 200 mg desvenlafaxine, 10 mg buspirone, 0.75 mg clonazepam, and 1 mg risperidone was added for the excessive fear as a trauma response. He was maintaining well during follow-ups in November and December. However, due to significant improvement, he abruptly stopped medication in January 2025 and reported back in February 2025, following the trigger of witnessing a road traffic accident, presenting again with cough episodes. Given prior good response, rTMS was re-initiated, and desvenlafaxine 100 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg were reintroduced. The patient showed significant clinical improvement by the end of 20 sessions of rTMS. Grounding techniques and breathing exercises were reinforced, and the patient was discharged on the same medication. He has been coming ever since for follow-up and psychotherapy sessions on stress management and relaxation. This case highlights a rare and strikingly atypical presentation of PTSD, in which psychogenic cough emerged as the predominant symptom, overshadowing the usual features such as reliving experiences, avoidance, and hyperarousal, but triggered by trauma reminders. It brings attention to the complex and often underappreciated interplay between psychological trauma, dissociative responses, and somatic symptomatology. Such presentations challenge conventional diagnostic frameworks and underscore the need for clinical vigilance in identifying non-traditional manifestations of trauma-related disorders. Although superficially it appears to be a dissociative disorder, the trauma and demonstrable reliving, avoidance, and hypervigilance established the diagnosis of PTSD. There are published atypical presentations of PTSD. A child perceived an animation series as traumatic and was later diagnosed with PTSD.[2] An African refugee in America presented with chronic abdominal and back pain, which was later found to be a trauma response to stabbing and hence was diagnosed with PTSD.[7] A 12-year-old girl with a history of ankle sprain after a road traffic accident persisted to have chronic ankle pain and PTSD, was diagnosed.[8] A Turkish soldier presented with spontaneous ejaculations, and it was his presentation of PTSD.[9] Our patient reported a recurrent cough. The case further exemplifies the importance of a comprehensive, mu ltimodal treatment, incorporating pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation (rTMS), and psychotherapy. The patient's significant clinical improvement following rTMS reinforces its therapeutic value among poor responders to conventional treatment of PTSD. Despite growing evidence supporting its efficacy,[10] rTMS remains underutilised, possibly due to limited accessibility and high costs. All in all, PTSD can have diverse presentations, and clinicians' careful assessment is the key.

Common evening and night time disorders also include restless legs syndrome and associated periodic limb movements of sleep. Screening questions often help to identify the sleep problem that you are dealing with (box 1). Thereafter, sleep problems are best characterised on the basis of a thorough history. A collateral history from the bed partner is often helpful to define any restless legs, sleepwalking or parasomnia, snoring, and breathing abnormalities. Discussing the patient’s ideas about sleep, any concerns they might have, and their expectations of normal sleep is often worth while. #### Box 1: Sleep history questions",

      "title": "[Sleep disturbances in schizophrenia].",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is often related with sleep disorders. In clinical practice insomnia is a common feature in schizophrenia. Difficulty falling asleep, maintaining or achieving a restful sleep is associated with symptoms severity and has been listed as a prodromal symptom of psychotic relapse. Sleep disturbances in schizophrenia may arise during the acute phase of illness and persists in many cases in chronic phase.The authors intend to review the main sleep disturbances observed in schizophrenia, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, their clinical impact, and the effects of antipsychotic medication on sleep architecture.This study was carried out a systematic search of published literature from January 1965 to May 2010, through PubMed, using the following key words: sleep, REM sleep, NREM sleep, schizophrenia, polysomnography, actigraphy and antipsychotics.Most changes found in objective studies using the polysomnography, in patients with schizophrenia are: reduction of total sleep time, decrease in slow wave sleep, REM latency and sleep efficiency. Studies using actigraphy also reveal that these patients experience changes in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, specifically the irregular type and phase advance. Although some sleep disorders improve with antipsychotic treatment, in many cases, even during the remission of the disease, sleep continues fragmented , suggesting that there are physiopathologic mechanisms involved in sleep disturbance in these patients.Privation of adequate and restful sleep has a negative impact on rehabilitation strategies, quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, and may contribute to worsening of cognitive deficits.",

      "title": "[Disruptive nocturnal behavior in elderly subjects: could it be a parasomnia?].",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment and depression",
      "abstract": "The commonality of cognitive impairment and depression is discussed. Cognitive symptoms are the main symptoms of depressive disorder and, most often, it is cognitive impairment that reduces the performance and quality of life of depressed patients. The most common cognitive disorders in depressed patients are: attention deficit (both visual and auditory), decrease in the level of short-term and operative memory, difficulties in processing information of any modality, a decrease in the speed of information processing, as well as difficulties in building an activity program and monitoring her execution. A cognitive symptom that requires further discussion is the so-called cognitive distortion – a shift in focus from positive to negative stimuli, as well as incorrect reactions to negative feedback and decision making. A depressive episode develops against the background of dysmetabolic and dysfunctional cerebral changes in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal and mediobasal frontal cortex. Cognitive impairment in patients who have had depression persists after recovery from depression; according to the figurative expression adopted in the scientific community of specialists studying cognitive impairment in depression, each depressive episode forms permanent “cognitive scars”. Presumably, cognitive dysfunction may be one of the risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder; depression, in turn, is a risk factor for the development of dementia, including in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease: studies have shown that the transformation of severe cognitive impairment associated with depression into dementia in elderly patients can reach 70% in five years. The undoubted commonality of depression and cognitive dysfunction is emphasized by the frequency of depression in patients with cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Carersʼ experiences of seeking help for relatives with first-episode psychosis: a systematic review of qualitative evidence.",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to synthesize the best available evidence on the lived experience of carers of a relative with a first-episode psychosis (FEP) and in particular their experience preceding and of seeking help. More specifically, the objectives are to explore: Perceived promoters and inhibitors to help-seeking during a FEP. Perceived barriers and facilitators to accessing services during a FEP. Background Psychotic disorders are low prevalence disorders, affecting between 1-2% of the adult population.1 Onset of first-episode psychosis (FEP), the first presentation of psychotic symptoms, is typically during late adolescent and early adult years.1, 2 Positive psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and behaviour.3, 4 Onset may be sudden or insidious, though most individuals experience a prodromal phase manifested by the gradual development of a variety of signs and symptoms that are commonly vague and nonspecific e.g. functional and social decline, sleep disturbance and mood symptoms.4-6 Individuals detected in this phase are considered to be ‘ultra high risk’ clinically, though development of psychosis is not inevitable.7 Though low in prevalence, psychotic disorders account for a high proportion of resources allocated to mental health services and are associated with significant challenges for those with the illness as well as their families.1, 2 During late adolescent and early adult years a young person is developing in many areas including formation of friendships, vocational goals, and general independence.2 The experience of mental illness during these formative years can divert a person from the trajectory of normal life development and significantly disrupt the person's life goals.8, 9 For those presenting at a later stage in life, other developmental issues will be of importance such as partners and children.10 A recent Australian national survey of people living with a psychotic illness, designed to capture the impact of psychosis, concluded that ‘psychosis is associated with substantial and persistent disability’.2(p.97) More specifically, participants named the following challenges: financial difficulties (42.7%), loneliness (37.2%), unemployment (35.1%), poor physical health (27.4%) uncontrolled symptoms of mental illness (25.7%), lack of stable/suitable housing (18.1%) and stigma (11.6%).2 Whilst some people will experience one psychotic episode and obtain full recovery, a significant number (61.5%) reported recurrent episodes with good or partial recovery during episodes and 30.5% experienced a continuous chronic illness.2 Early intervention for FEP has been a focus of care for several decades. It arose from the premise that the early years of illness are a ‘critical period’ for intervention when there can be significant decline but also most scope for influencing longer term prognosis.9, 11, 12 The main aims of such services are to shorten the course of the initial psychotic episode, reduce the severity of the illness, and subsequently minimize disruption to the person's life.9, 12 Key components of early intervention include medication to reduce symptoms and psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting the individual's recovery.13 Even after onset of psychosis there is typically a delay in accessing appropriate treatment.14 The period of time between onset of first psychotic symptom and first treatment, referred to as the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), has been a major focus of research and intervention. This is because DUP is considered to be an important and malleable prognostic factor. A systematic review to establish whether DUP is associated with prognosis included a meta-analysis of 26 studies from diverse cultural backgrounds including 4490 participants.15 The results showed there is evidence of a moderate association between DUP and symptomatic and functional outcome in the short term (6-12 month follow up), though it remains inconclusive as to whether reducing a person's DUP improves overall prognosis. Mean DUP was found to be two years.15 The Treatment and Intervention in Psychosis (TIPS) early detection and intervention programme in Norway successfully reduced median DUP from 16 to 5 weeks.16 At ten-year follow up, though reported symptoms were comparable across the early detection group and usual detection group, there were significant gains in recovery for the early detection group due to increased employment.17 Reducing DUP remains a common service goal.13 DUP is typically long, meaning individuals18 and their families19-21 are often required to cope with distressing symptoms for many months or longer. Many individuals and families report high levels of distress during the stage of untreated psychosis. First-episode psychosis is a high-risk period for suicidality22 which is important as previous suicide attempts are predictors of later attempts and completed suicide.23 Gersen et al24 found that families of relatives with a FEP predominantly use adaptive coping strategies. In contrast, families of individuals with a more chronic illness reportedly use increased maladaptive strategies, suggesting the impact of burden and stress of care over time on coping.24, 25 A recent systematic review measuring the effectiveness of early intervention on clinical outcome was inconclusive, with the exception of sustained positive impact in the areas of employment and family.26 Whilst this may have implications for future funding directives, it does not reduce the need for individuals with a FEP to receive early and appropriate intervention. Minimising the impact of psychosis for individuals and improving outcome remains a priority in Clinical Practice Guidelines in many countries.3, 27, 28 Quick and timely access to services can positively impact on the distress experienced by both the ill person and their families. Reaching those individuals experiencing a FEP during the early stages of illness requires ‘early detection of psychosis in the community and understanding factors associated with and contributing to delay in help-seeking’.14(p.76) The literature related to pathways to care explores barriers and facilitators to accessing services. This encompasses help-seeking behaviour, accessibility of services and service response.9, 29, 30 Help-seeking can be defined as ‘“the behaviour of actively seeking help from other people” (Rickwood, Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005, p. 4)31 and can be directed towards formal sources, such as mental health professionals, or informal sources, such as family and friends’ (Dr Coralie Wilson, personal communication, 2012 Mar 27). For young people informal sources are the preferred source of help.31, 32 In FEP it is frequently family members that initiate successful contacts for their relatives20, 33 and often without the affected individual participating in the contact.34 Before help-seeking can occur there needs to be a recognition that the person is in need of help.32 Recognition that a disorder is developing, knowledge of treatment options and knowledge of effective help-seeking strategies are all components of ‘mental health literacy’.32 Community surveys of mental health literacy show that many people are unable to recognize mental illness, though there is evidence that improvements can be made by education strategies at a community level.16, 32 This knowledge is now impacting upon policy development, with programmes designed to develop people's mental health literacy and help-seeking skills.16, 27, 32, 35 In a systematic review aiming to understand and measure pathways to care in FEP, Singh14 notes that there remains a delay for relatives to seek help even when a problem has become evident. Understanding individuals' personal narratives and journeys is one method of enhancing understanding of the processes that affect help-seeking.14 Delays in accessing appropriate treatment arise at all levels including illness recognition, help-seeking and service response. Help-seeking is just one factor that can impact on delay to treatment.36 Delays at service level can also be significant and for varied reasons, e.g. lack of affordable services, inflexibility of appointments37 and delayed diagnosis within mental health services.38 Common themes relating to delayed help-seeking include: stigma, misattribution of symptoms (e.g. drugs, stress or typical changes of adolescence), not knowing where to go, hope that the symptoms will go away without intervention, and a raised threshold for seeking help.5, 39, 40 Factors associated with successful help-seeking include: frank psychotic symptoms, depression and suicidal thinking and reaching a crisis.5, 18, 20 When studies include both individuals and families of FEP, considerable congruence is reported in themes and experiences when help-seeking.18, 21 Research to date provides information regarding potential barriers and facilitators to help-seeking in a FEP. Increased awareness of the impact of prolonged DUP and benefits of early intervention has driven the need to further explore and understand the pathways to care for people experiencing a FEP. A preliminary search of the literature reveals qualitative studies exploring individuals' and their carers' experiences of help-seeking during a FEP.5, 21, 41 Carers play a crucial role in accessing help for relatives14, 21, often being the primary and sole help-seeker.34 A search of the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute Library of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, CINAHL and PROSPERO databases did not reveal any previous or planned systematic reviews of qualitative evidence on this topic. A synthesis of the relevant studies of carers' experiences will add to the understanding of illness recognition, help-seeking strategies utilized and service response and may provide important information regarding pathways to care for those experiencing a FEP. Definition of terms First-episode psychosis (FEP) For the purpose of this review all operational definitions of FEP will be considered. This means first-episode may be defined as first treatment contact, duration of antipsychotic medication use or duration of psychosis.42 Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include carers of a relative with a FEP. This means first presentation of psychotic symptoms with no limit to duration of untreated psychosis. Method of diagnosis may be according to any of the editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), research diagnostic criteria relevant to the country of study or confirmed by a psychiatrist or other health care professional. Psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations and delusions. Psychotic disorders may include: Schizophrenia Schizoaffective disorders Mania with psychotic symptoms Depression with psychotic symptoms Delusional disorders Acute and transient psychotic disorders Other and unspecified non-organic psychotic disorder. There will be no age restriction for the person experiencing the psychosis. Carers could be a parent, sibling, spouse or other relative of any age. Studies that predominantly include individuals in the prepsychotic or ultra high-risk stage of illness will be excluded due to the ‘low’ conversion rate to psychosis. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that investigate the experience of carers of a relative with a first-episode psychosis, and in particular their experience preceding and of seeking help from both informal (family and friends) and formal (services) sources. Types of outcomes The review will consider research conducted in any mental health care setting including inpatient, outpatient and community. Types of studies This review will consider studies that focus on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. In the absence of research studies, other text such as opinion papers and reports will be considered. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Studies published in English will be considered for inclusion in this review. Studies published between January 1990 and August 2012 will be considered for inclusion in this review. This is due to focus of care on first-episode psychosis and pathways to care developing in the early 1990's. The databases to be searched include: CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Embase. The search for unpublished studies will include: Mednar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Trove, relevant professional bodies in the field of Early Intervention in Psychosis and carers in mental health. Initial keywords to be used will be: help-seeking; care-givers; first-episode psychosis; qualitative. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Data will be extracted from qualitative research papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI (Appendix I). The data extracted will include specific details about the phenomena of interest, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Qualitative research findings will, where possible, be pooled using JBI-QARI. This will involve the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation, through assembling the findings rated according to their quality, and categorising these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning. These categories are then subjected to a meta-synthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Where textual pooling is not possible, the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are common conditions manifested as misalignment between the sleep period and the physical/social 24-h environmental cycle. Delayed sleep phase (typical in adolescents) and advanced sleep phase (frequent in the elderly), situations in which the sleep period is displaced to a later or earlier time, respectively, are the two most prevalent circadian rhythm sleep disorders. There are, however, nine possible diagnoses of clinical interest. Since light is the main cue used in synchronizing the biological clock, blind individuals and night-shift/rotating-shift workers are more prone to develop circadian rhythm sleep disorders. In this article, the circadian rhythm syndromes included in the new International Classification of Sleep Disorders are reviewed as well as the most recent guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.",

      "title": "Drugs affecting sleep and wakefulness: a review",
      "abstract": "It was in the second half of the twentieth century that Sleep Medicine was recognized as an immensely respected field of clinical research. As a result, past few decades have seen this field making some giant strides towards a better understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms that regulate the state of sleep and wakefulness. This involves a complex interplay of neuronal systems, neurotransmitters and some special nuclei located in the brain. Major wakefulness promoting nuclei being the orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic region and the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) while the sleep-promoting nucleus being ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). Sleep-related complaints are one of the common complaints encountered by the physicians and the psychiatrists. As, long-standing sleep disturbances can have far-reaching implications on an individual’s physical, mental and social wellbeing, the importance of drugs affecting sleep and wakefulness could not be stressed upon anymore. Broadly, the sleep disorders are classified as insomnia, hypersomnia, and parasomnia and the presently available drugs work either by acting on the sleep-promoting GABAergic system like benzodiazepines, barbiturates etc. or by interacting with wakefulness promoting system like histaminergic system, 5- hydroxtryptaminergic system, orexinergic system etc. There are drugs which interact with other mechanisms which modulate arousal, like melatonin receptor agonists which promote sleep and adenosine receptor antagonists which promote wakefulness. This review article tries to have an overview of the available drugs for use in pathological states of sleep and wakefulness with a special emphasis on the commonly prescribed drugs and the recently approved one’s.",

      "title": "Anxiety disorders including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)",
      "abstract": "Increasing numbers of studies of correctional populations have emphasized diagnosis with structured clinical instruments over the past two decades. These studies have primarily focused on serious mental illness (i.e., psychotic and mood disorders), substance use disorders, and personality disorders. The focus has made sense because of the need to identify the severely mentally ill who are incarcerated and to identify the most common disorders. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias. One anxiety disorder that stands apart from others is PTSD, which is prevalent at much higher rates in both incarcerated men and women than in the community. Despite this fact, other anxiety disorders are often co-morbid and add to overall disease burden and impair ability to function. Individuals with a greater disease burden (i.e., number of diagnoses, symptom counts) have worse outcomes than those with uncomplicated disorders. These impaired outcomes include a deteriorating trajectory of illness, increased health service utilization, poor prognosis, and increased likelihood of morbidity and mortality. Thus, while anxiety disorders may not be the primary focus of the correctional system, they must be recognized as important. Unrecognized anxiety disorders can result in behavior that is disruptive and may appear to be volitional. They can also lead to overutilization of health services that are already facing substantial demands. Appropriate, available, and consistent assessment, diagnosis, and treatment that are well integrated can successfully intervene in the range of anxiety disorders that present in correctional settings.",

      "title": "<i>Sleep Deprivation and Vigilant Attention</i>",
      "abstract": "Sleep deprivation severely compromises the ability of human beings to respond to stimuli in a timely fashion. These deficits have been attributed in large part to failures of vigilant attention, which many theorists believe forms the bedrock of the other more complex components of cognition. One of the leading paradigms used as an assay of vigilant attention is the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), a high signal‐load reaction‐time test that is extremely sensitive to sleep deprivation. Over the last twenty years, four dominant findings have emerged from the use of this paradigm. First, sleep deprivation results in an overall slowing of responses. Second, sleep deprivation increases the propensity of individuals to lapse for lengthy periods (&gt;500 ms), as well as make errors of commission. Third, sleep deprivation enhances the time‐on‐task effect within each test bout. Finally, PVT results during extended periods of wakefulness reveal the presence of interacting circadian and homeostatic sleep drives. A theme that links these findings is the interplay of “top‐down” and “bottom‐up” attention in producing the unstable and unpredictable patterns of behavior that are the hallmark of the sleep‐deprived state.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

Assumptions are made that nightmares occur more often in psychiatric patients than in the normal population and that they are accompanied by an elevated anxiety level in the daytime. From a psychophysiological point of view nightmares possibly are derailed attemps of problem solving, of overcoming frightening experiences. In this review the importance of nightmares as symptom in psychiatry is assessed. It appears that they are no indication of an elevated anxiety level in the day-time or of psychopathology in general, and they are no criterium for the diagnosis of schizophrenia either.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is considered as a great human value related to happiness and satisfaction, but unfortunately, when affecting mental disorders, they tend to be associated with second level human functions. Nevertheless, sexual dysfunction often accompanies psychiatric disorder, intensely influencing compliance, quality of life and human relationships. Sexuality could be influenced either by a mental disorder itself, difficulties to get and maintain couple relationships or by the use of psychotropic treatments. Treatment-related adverse events are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians, scarcely spontaneously communicated by patients, and rarely investigated in clinical trials. The most frequent psychotropic compounds that could deteriorate sexuality and quality of life include antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood regulators. There are important differences between them related to some variations in mechanisms of action including serotonin, dopamine and prolactin levels. Little is known about the relevance of sexuality and its dysfunctions in chronic and frequent mental and neurological disorders, such as psychosis, mood disorders, anxiety, phobias, eating disorders, alcohol or drug dependencies, epilepsy and childhood pathology. Poor sexual life, low satisfaction and more frequent risky sex behavior than in the general population are associated with severe mental diseases. There is a need for increasing research in this field, including epidemiological, psychological, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic variables related to sexual life to get a better understanding of the implicated mechanisms. To increase the sensibility of clinicians, the identification and management of sexual disturbances after the onset of any mental disorder should be highlighted. This would avoid unnecessary suffering and deterioration of quality of life.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common and most serious mental health problem affecting all age groups, genders, communities throughout the world. It is increasing very rapidly day by day. It is characterised by persistent sadness, and a loss of interest in daily activities that a person normally enjoys, accompanied by an inability to carry out daily activities for at least two weeks. In addition, there may be a loss of energy, a change in appetite, changes in sleeping pattern, anxiety, reduced concentration, indecisiveness, restlessness, feeling of worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness, thoughts of self-harm and committing suicide. According to WHO report, prevalence of depression is about 5% in general population. Currently more than 300 million people are suffering worldwide from it. It is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents suffering from depression. In Unani perspective, depression is not a disease rather it is a symptom or a group of symptoms of Malenkholiya (Melancholia) in which the mental functions of the individual are disturbed leading to constant grief, fear and uncertain aggression. The patient finds himself/herself isolated and occupied, feels lonely and some patients experience delusion and hallucinations. There is also a change in feelings, mood and behaviour of patient. At times patient becomes overanxious and his thoughts and thinking process gets disturbed. Person suffering from Malenkholiya becomes easily irritable, prefers loneliness and is fearful of usual things. There are a number of factors responsible for depression but Unani scholars consider Ghair Tabayi Sauda (Abnormal black bile) as the main cause of psychological and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, etc. There are different regimens in Unani System of Medicine (USM) for correction of psychiatric disorders (depression) such as Ilaj-bil-Ghiza (dietotharapy), Ilaj bit tadabeer (regimenal therapy), Ilaj-bil-Dawa (pharmacotherapy or medicinal therapy).",

      "abstract": "Sleep medicine is relevant in both neurology and general medicine. A disordered sleep–wake cycle can have major effects on many common neurological complaints such as headache and epilepsy, and it may also directly affect important general health issues, such as blood pressure. Furthermore, sleep related disorders such as parasomnias, particularly with agitation, can be hazardous to patients and bed partners while also being diagnostic clues in some neurodegenerative diseases. The traditional view that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness has been increasingly refined over the past 50 years or so. Rather, it is a precisely orchestrated and complex state with distinct and mutually exclusive phases: non-rapid eye movement (stages 1–4) and rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM and REM sleep, respectively), defined largely by the surface EEG. In a typical night, there are 4–5 cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (figure 1). In REM sleep, the cortical EEG is highly activated in common with wakefulness, usually corresponding to the vivid dreaming that accompanies REM sleep. REM sleep periods predominate towards the end of the nocturnal sleep period whereas the deepest stages of non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) tend to occur within an hour of sleep onset. Figure 1 (A) EEG waveforms that define wake and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages. (B) An idealised hypnogram summarising the distribution of the sleep stages through a typical night. Black bars refer to REM sleep during which the EEG pattern returns to that seen in wakefulness. Given the normal variation in sleep patterns and habits between people, distinguishing whether or not a sleep related symptom suggests a formal disorder can be difficult. It is a salutary fact that normal ageing is associated with deteriorating and poorly consolidated nocturnal sleep.",

The association of stigma invariably leads to a decrease in the quality of life of the people diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression or any other mental disorder. The care needs of these categories of people are complex and are often not accessible, and the recovery remains at a clinical level. Psychosocial rehabilitation, associated with personal/subjective recovery, becomes thus a legitimate field of intervention meant to increase the recovery potential and the quality of life within the community.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "abstract": "Insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping are all highly prevalent among the elderly, reflecting changes in sleep architecture, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and circadian sleep-wake cycles. Insomnia is sometimes associated with subjective daytime sleepiness, as well as other clinical and socioeconomic consequences. The daytime sleepiness will at times lead to napping. Although napping is viewed as a common age-related occurrence, little is known about its benefits or consequences. Factors reported to be contributors to daytime napping include sleep-maintenance difficulty and sleep fragmentation with consequent daytime sleepiness, nighttime use of long-acting sedating agents, daytime use of sedating medications, and dementia. However, a correlation between sleep disturbance and daytime napping has not been consistently observed. Whether napping is beneficial, neutral, or detrimental is an important issue, in light of conflicting findings regarding the impact of daytime napping on nighttime sleep and recent reports of an association between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, including increased mortality risk. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between napping and insomnia, and between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, and to explore the clinical implications of improving insomnia and reducing daytime napping. Clinical evaluations of hypnotic agents should assess efficacy for both improving insomnia symptoms (particularly sleep-maintenance difficulty, in the case of elderly patients) and reducing daytime sleepiness that would lead to inadvertent napping.",

      "abstract": "The fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) appears to be more severe, more functionally impairing, and less likely to be alleviated by rest than fatigue commonly experienced by healthy individuals. The words used by individuals with CFS to describe their fatigue are characterized by terms that deal with functional limitations, frustration, loss of control, permanence, depression, and pervasiveness—language that clearly reflects their diminished quality of life (QOL). With respect to etiology, CFS has been conceptualized among a spectrum of stress-related, functional disorders characterized by profound fatigue and, frequently, pain. In terms of sleep characteristics, individuals with CFS display the characteristic signs of poor overall sleep efficiency that is typically seen in persons with insomnia. They frequently experience nonrestorative sleep, and their daytime functioning is also seriously compromised. QOL scores reflect findings which show that symptoms of CFS significantly undermine many facets of these individuals' lives and significantly impair physical and social functioning as well as participation in activities of daily living. Physicians have little to offer their patients who have CFS. Friends and family, also unable to help, often tell people who have CFS to \"just get on with your life,\" \"pull yourself together,\" and \"stop moping around.\" By dismissing and invalidating the lived experience of individuals with CFS, they contribute to an already poor QOL. Despite recent progress in understanding the biological mechanisms of the illness, more work needs to be done to find effective clinical treatments. Healthcare professionals and disability insurance carriers need to be informed that CFS is a real and disabling physical illness.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

      "abstract": "Today, prolonged wakefulness is a widespread phenomenon. Nevertheless, in the field of sleep and wakefulness, several unanswered questions remain. Prolonged wakefulness can be due to acute total sleep deprivation (SD) or to chronic partial sleep restriction. Although the latter is more common in everyday life, the effects of total SD have been examined more thoroughly. Both total and partial SD induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. First and foremost, total SD impairs attention and working memory, but it also affects other functions, such as long-term memory and decision-making. Partial SD is found to influence attention, especially vigilance. Studies on its effects on more demanding cognitive functions are lacking. Coping with SD depends on several factors, especially aging and gender. Also interindividual differences in responses are substantial. In addition to coping with SD, recovering from it also deserves attention. Cognitive recovery processes, although insufficiently studied, seem to be more demanding in partial sleep restriction than in total SD.",

The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether.

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

Sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and terminal insomnia with unrefreshed sleep and disturbing dreams have been consistently reported in the studies of adults with MDD. Hypersomnia has been reported in a subset of adult depressives. Although sleep disturbances may be present throughout all phases of a depressive disorder, they are most severe during an acute episode. Patients with depression who report sleep disturbances are more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not report difficulties with their sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep to such a degree that patients may have vegetative symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important when assessing a depressed patient with sleep difficulties to consider a thorough sleep assessment to rule out a physiological cause of vegetative symptoms of depression and insomnia. Those with depression who also exhibit sleep disturbance can benefit from behavioral and relaxation training (1).",

É mais comum na infância e com episódios únicos diários, no primeiro terço da noite, sendo que a tentativa de fuga do paciente pode acarretar danos físicos a si ou a terceiros. Objetivos: fornecer uma síntese das informações mais relevantes sobre o terror noturno. Materiais e Métodos: revisão não sistemática da literatura nacional e internacional sobre aspectos classificatórios, epidemiológicos, diagnósticos, fisiológicos e terapêuticos do terror noturno. Resultados: O paciente não costuma recordar do ocorrido e imagens mentais não são comuns, porém, quando presentes, costumam ser simples e sem significado. O diagnóstico é principalmente baseado em anamnese detalhada e deve-se diferenciá-lo de outros distúrbios do sono como pesadelos, sonambulismo e epilepsia de lobo frontal. Seu tratamento envolve medidas gerais de segurança a fim de ser evitar acidentes no momento da crise e, nos casos mais graves, terapêutica farmacológica pautada em antidepressivos tricíclicos, benzodiazepínicos ou inibidores da recaptação de serotonina pode ser necessária. Conclusão: embora mais frequente em crianças, o terror noturno pode ocorrer na fase adulta e trazer implicações sociais maiores, além do risco de injúrias pela tentativa de fuga. Dessa forma, recomenda-se o conhecimento da patologia por parte dos médicos para manejo correto do distúrbio, evitando assim consequências sociais, físicas e laborais que um transtorno do sono pode acarretar.Descritores: Terrores Noturnos; Parassonias; Transtornos do Sono-Vigília.",

      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC.

Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia with Somatic Delusions: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nSchizophrenia is a mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the general population. Symptoms most commonly include auditory hallucinations, several types of delusions, disorganization in speech and behavior, formal thought disorder, and negative symptoms including poverty of speech, thought or motivation. Of the delusional symptoms, somatic delusions-those that pertain to the body-are rather rare. Somatic delusions are defined as fixed false beliefs that one's bodily function or appearance is grossly abnormal. They are a poorly understood psychiatric symptom and pose a significant clinical challenge to clinicians. Studies indicate that only one third of this patient population has a positive treatment outcome with resolution of symptoms. While challenges exist in treating patients when they present with somatic delusions alone, it becomes far more difficult when somatic delusions present in patients with schizophrenia. Physical symptoms such as pain or discomfort are often incorrectly perceived or misinterpreted by psychotic patients. Often medical conditions are overshadowed by psychosis and may get undiagnosed or overlooked which could potentially result in fatal errors for patients. While little has been written about patients with true delusions that are somatic in nature, somatic delusions, specifically somatic delusions associated with schizophrenia are particularly under reported in the literature. Here, we describe the case of a 40-year-old Hispanic-American patient with established chronic schizophrenia. From her initial presentation to the hospital, she exhibited and perseverated on a number of somatic delusions about her body including her bones being twisted around one another, delusions of pregnancy and abortion, and her normally-functioning arm being broken. This paper will also explore treatment challenges posed by these complicated patients. In addition, a review of potential cultural influences as well as the economic burden that such patients place on the health care sector by their numerous emergency room and office visits will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Wounds and wound healing are often considered to be purely medical phenomena, but there is growing evidence that the psychological impact on the patient is of equal importance. The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

The apparent suicide (for example, leap to death from a second-storey window), assault or murder (for example, molestation, strangulation, stabbing, shooting) may be the unintentional, non-culpable but catastrophic result of disorders of arousal, sleep-related seizures, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), or psychogenic dissociative states. Violent sleep-related behaviors have been reviewed in the context of automatic behavior in general, with many well-documented cases resulting from a wide variety of disorders. Conditions associated with sleep-period-related violence fall into two major categories: neurologic and psychiatric. Psychogenic dissociative disorders may arise exclusively or predominantly from the sleep period. Recent interest in the forensic aspects of parasomnias provides sleep medicine professionals with an opportunity to educate and assist the legal profession in cases of sleep-related violence. One infrequently used tactic to improve scientific testimony is to use a court-appointed impartial expert.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia requires both a report of poor sleep at night and residual daytime impairment associated with the poor sleep. Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

Its true function and even the amount needed for optimum brain performance remain uncertain (Frank 2006). However, the need to sleep is imperative, reflecting the fact that sleepiness, like hunger and thirst, is a true drive state. Sleepiness can only be satiated by sleep itself. Moreover, severely disordered sleep can profoundly affect cognition, mental health, and physical well-being. Although sleep medicine has a traditionally low profile in neurology teaching and practice, sleep-related phenomena are frequently associated with numerous neurological disorders. Conversely, sleep problems can adversely affect familiar conditions such as headache and epilepsy. Furthermore, in large surveys, sleep-related symptoms are undoubtedly common with 25 per cent of the population reporting problems that significantly and regularly impact on daily activities.",

      "title": "Medicinal Plants Combating Against Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a state defined as trouble with sleep; it is a chronically disabling condition and is now significantly prevalent, imposing enormous health and economic burdens both on individuals and on society. This state includes trouble in falling asleep, problems staying asleep, fragmented sleep (repeatedly awakening at night), and/or awakening before time in the morning. This difficulty in sleeping causes feeling exhausted during the day and trouble with daytime activities including driving, family responsibilities, and completion of valued daily routines. Different types of synthetic sedative drugs are used to handle nervous system changes, but repeated use of sedatives caused tolerance in the human body. After a while, people had to take a heavy dose of sedative to make them feel sleepy, which imposes extra toxic effects on vital organs of the body. Medicinal plants are gaining more and more attention as sedative agents because herbs contained different types of natural bioactive metabolites with not well reported side effects. In addition, medicinal plants have economic, high efficacy and are easy available. So in current review plants possessing sedative activities have been compiled with their constituents responsible to manage insomnia. Review of the literature indicated that medicinal plants from various systems of medicine have been reported to possess sedative activity. This review suggests that medicinal plants are efficacious for insomnia; further laboratory and clinical studies are required.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "abstract": "Headache and sleep disorders are prevalent, comorbid conditions that challenge physical as well as psychosocial well-being. Headache is the most common pain-related complaint and the seventh leading ailment seen in medical practice, accounting for 18 million physician visits annually in the USA alone (1). Though historically headache often has been trivialized (perhaps because pain is not easily quantified and headache does not generally compromise life expectancy), headache is in a major quality of life (QOL) concern. In fact, migraine headache is among the 20 leading causes of \"years lived with disability\" according the World Health Report (2). The burden of headache is increasingly appreciated in psychological, family and interpersonal, vocational, and economic realms. Headache, particularly in its more chronic and severe forms, has been linked to sleep disorders. Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are varied in nature, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. General symptom patterns, particularly morning headache and chronic daily headache, are suggestive of and aid in recognition of a sleep disorder. Management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache; sleep-disordered breathing is the most empirically supported example of this relationship. Although pure sleep-related headaches, such as hypoxemia-related headache, are less prevalent and more easily recognized, primary headaches as well are often impacted to some degree by sleep. Irrespective of sleep disorders, variation in the sleep/wake schedule is one of the most common acute headache precipitants while sleeping is one of the most common palliative responses to headache. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Despite an emerging literature supporting the interdependence of sleep and headache, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains speculative. Few well-controlled studies are available, and it is difficult to generalize results across sleep and headache literatures due to inconsistencies in diagnostic nosologies, lack of standardized outcome measures, and varied populations. Future research with improved methods is needed to identify mediating factors between sleep and headache. This chapter reviews the co-morbidity of headache and sleep disorders, prevalence, diagnostic considerations, societal and individual burden of headache, clinical implications, and considerations for future directions.",

      "title": "Parasomnias: A Review for Psychiatrists",
      "abstract": "The category of sleep disorders known as parasomnias includes behavioral disturbances occurring during sleep or states of mixed sleep and wakefulness. They can be minimal and confined to vocalizations or minor movements or of a magnitude that can lead to serious injury, disruption of relationships, and diagnostic ambiguity. Many can be mistakenly thought to represent manifestations of psychiatric disorders. Careful evaluation and therapy can prevent inappropriate psychiatric diagnosis, avoid ineffective treatment, and ameliorate the sleep disorders. Herein, many parasomnias will be brought to the attention of practicing psychiatrists who can learn to recognize enough of the most important clinical features to ensure appropriate consultation with a sleep medicine specialist.",

Moderate levels of anxiety are often welcomed to improve performance, and quite severe levels of anxiety can be experienced as normal when they are consistent with the demands of the situation. Persons with anxiety disorders are usually not just complaining of being too anxious too often, for they seek help with specific and recurring fears that they recognize as irrational and somewhat intrusive. To paraphrase the description in Chapter 1: the fears are of physical collapse in panic disorder and agoraphobia, of negative evaluation in social phobia, of harm to self or loved ones in GAD, of self-caused harm to self or loved ones in OCD, of improbable harm to self in the specific phobias, and of the intrusive memory of past threats of harm in PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as difficulty staying awake during the usual waking hours. The prevalence of EDS is estimated to be 18–20% in the United States. EDS may occur as a result of numerous conditions, including insufficient sleep or other central disorders of hypersomnolence, sleep-related breathing disorders, medications or substances, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, psychiatric or neurological disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, pregnancy, and various metabolic disorders and medical conditions. True sleepiness is the propensity to fall asleep and is not synonymous with fatigue or always associated with decreased vigilance. Excessive self-reported subjective sleepiness on validated scales such as the ESS may be useful for suggesting the presence of a possible sleep disorder requiring evaluation. However, patients may misinterpret fatigue associated with medical and psychiatric conditions as sleepiness or have an inaccurate perception of the degree of their sleepiness. Objective tests of sleepiness may be helpful to determine whether an abnormal propensity to fall asleep is present. The assessment and diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is usually made based on a combination of sleep history, past medical, psychiatric, surgical, and family history, a physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.",

Examples given include circadian sleep–wake cycle disorders (such as the delayed sleep phase syndrome), obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, Kleine–Levin syndrome, sleep paralysis and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. Failure to recognise and treat such disorders is likely to cause and perpetuate psychological problems.

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

The relationship seems to be bidirectional, and persistent disturbed sleep may influence the course of the disorder. With regard to sleep quality, insomnia and nocturnal anxiety symptoms, as well as nightmares and stressful dreams, are the most prominent sleep symptoms. Polysomnographic measurements reveal alterations of the sleep architecture and fragmentation of rapid eye movement sleep. In addition, sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders and parasomnias are frequent comorbid conditions. The complex etiology and symptomatology of trauma-related sleep disorders with frequent psychiatric comorbidity require the application of multimodal treatment concepts, including psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, there is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of long-term drug treatment for insomnia and nightmares. For nondrug interventions, challenges arise from the current lack of PTSD-treatment concepts integrating sleep- and trauma-focused therapies. Effective therapy for sleep disturbances may consequently also improve well-being during the day and probably even the course of PTSD. Whether early sleep interventions exert a preventive effect on the development of PTSD remains to be clarified in future studies.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child9s period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

      "abstract": "Sleep deprivation has been hinted to have a deleterious effect on health workers who are involved in multitude of life saving tasks, which often require more attention and concentration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the national health portal (Government of India) have now recognized sleep deprivation as a public health epidemic. The main effects of sleep deprivation include physical effects (sleepiness, fatigue, or hypertension), cognitive impairment (deterioration of performance, attention, concentration and intellectual capacity and increase of the likelihood of accidents) and mental health complications. Rotational night shift work is often accompanied by insufficient sleep and disruption of circadian phase, each related to repeated errors on task performance as a result of lapses in attention and increased reaction time. Maintaining good quality of sleep is vital for the establishment of positive health and physical/mental well-being; nonetheless, lifestyle and environmental factors are progressively causing hitches in sleeping. Individuals with shift work sleep disorders need a customized and comprehensive therapy that includes counselling, yoga/meditation and behavioural therapy along with requisite pharmacological management, as and when warranted.",

      "abstract": "Hypersomnia, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and prolonged nocturnal sleep, poses significant challenges to individuals' daily functioning. Afflicted individuals struggle to stay awake during waking hours despite extended periods of sleep, often experiencing difficulties waking up in the morning. Cognitive functions, including memory and concentration, may be impaired, leading to social and occupational hindrances. While short naps provide minimal relief, hypersomnia's impact on overall well-being necessitates timely diagnosis and intervention. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive assessment of medical history and, if required, polysomnography. Treatment strategies, ranging from lifestyle modifications to pharmacological interventions, aim to address the underlying causes, which may be primary or secondary to other medical conditions. Timely recognition and management of hypersomnia are crucial to mitigating its adverse effects on daily life and fostering improved sleep quality and daytime alertness.",

The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

The etiology of FMS remains unknown, being one of the most accepted hypothesis the presence of central sensitization to pain and impairments in endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. The history of the development of FMS concept reveals how other symptoms -apart from pain- has become also relevant in FMS diagnosis and treatment.&#x0D; The central symptom of FMS is pain. FMS patients generally report high levels of clinical pain, which are related to greater impairments in health related quality of life, cognitive abilities and disease course. Fatigue and sleeping difficulties are also common symptoms of FMS. Fatigue have shown positive associations with pain, stiffness, sleep problems, increased body mass index, FMS severity, tenderness, disability, cognitive complaints, anxiety and depression. The majority of FMS patients report poor sleep quality, take longer to fall asleep, generally wake up during the night, sleep fewer hours, and usually wake up unrefreshed. Emotional disturbances (i.e., depression, anxiety) are also frequent in FMS. In fact, depression and anxiety disorders have showed a negative impact on the clinical course and work capacity of FMS patients. Cognitive impairments are also a relevant symptom in FMS. The most common complaints among FMS patients are executive function deficits, attention problems, forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, and mental slowness. Regarding the most frequent treatments for FMS, these can be classified as non-psychological and psychological. The former includes analgesic drugs, adjuvant drugs (i.e., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, etc.), nerve blocks, electrostimulation at different levels, infiltrations, etc. The psychological therapies with the most evidence are cognitive-behavioral, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness.&#x0D; FMS is associated with a severe reduction of health related quality of life and psychosocial impairments. It is necessary to take all FMS symptoms and its relations into account in order to provide a more tailored and effective treatment, as well as, to improve the health related quality of life of FMS patients.",

      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders (PDs) in neurology are more frequent then it verified in routine exam, not only in the less developed but also in large and very developed neurological departments. Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition (ICSD-2) (1), a diagnosis of insomnia must confirm both the existence of nocturnal symptoms and a clinically significant impact during the patient's waking state. Nocturnal symptoms include difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakening, and interrupted or nonrestorative sleep. Daytime symptoms include distress about poor nocturnal sleep and impairment in any role function or other aspects of overall well-being. Researchers have traditionally used quantitative criteria to diagnose insomnia, but these criteria have not been standardized. Quantitative criteria for the frequency and duration of total wake time and/or total sleep time have been proposed (2), but these criteria have not been uniformly employed.",

Virtually all mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and trauma-related disorders carry an increased risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide. Psychiatric disorder may be an almost necessary, yet insufficient, risk factor for suicide. More than a half of individuals who attempt or commit suicide meet diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder, most often comorbid with anxiety symptoms, substance use disorders, personality disorders, or in severe cases psychotic symptoms. The risk of suicidal behaviour in anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive-disorders is often underestimated. Undertreatment, comorbidity, treatment non-compliance, and poor adherence, as well as a high frequency of non-responders are common problems and challenges in the treatment of suicidal persons. There is growing evidence of lower risk of suicidal behaviour during closely monitored long-term treatment of suicidal patients having mood disorder, especially bipolar illness, indicating that treatment adherence is an important factor in medical diagnostic-specific suicide prevention.",

Scientifically, fainting is called a «syncopal state» (the word «syncope» comes from the Greek syn — with, together; koptein — to cut off, to break off), and is characterized by short — term loss of consciousness against the background of transient hypoperfusion of the brain and a drop in muscle tone. The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which the person regains consciousness on his own. After fainting, there may be a feeling of general weakness, feelings of weakness, fatigue, and the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is characteristic for older people. In the vast majority of cases, syncopal conditions are of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting are associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. At the same time, in some cases, the cause of the syncopal condition cannot be determined [4].",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "Major depression is a common disorder; nearly 10% of the population suffers from a depressive illness in any given year. There is a strong association between sleep disturbances and depression. The most common sleep disturbance associated with major depressive disorder is insomnia. The relationship between insomnia and depression is bidirectional in that insomnia is one of the symptoms of depression and chronic insomnia can be a risk factor for depression. Depression causes changes in sleep patterns and sleep quality. Depressed patients showed prolonged sleep latency, increased wakefulness during sleep, early morning awakening, decreased sleep efficiency, decreased amounts of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep abnormalities. Depression is currently one of the leading causes of disability in the world. There is a direct association between the severity of depression and the level of disability. Depression has a big impact on quality of life of patients. Studies have showed that patients with major depressive disorder have poorer quality of life than persons from the general population. Effects of depression on quality of life are equal to or greater than those of patients with chronic medical conditions. Untreated depression usually does not go away by itself and often gets worse with time and increases a person's risk of suicide; it is a fact that up to 15% of those who are clinically depressed die through suicide. Clinical depression is treatable with counseling and medication. The majority of people with depressive disorders improve when they receive appropriate treatment. Improvement in depressive symptoms during the treatment is related to improvement in the quality of life. Antidepressants are shown to improve quality of life. There are some tools for evaluating quality of life in depressive patients, today. These tools help us to assess improvement in depressive patients beyond the extent to which depression rating scales do. In clinical settings, quality of life instruments can show us when patients begin to feel benefits of antidepressant therapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

      "title": "Excessive daytime sleepiness in sleep disorders.",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is a significant public health problem, with prevalence in the community estimated to be as high as 18%. Sleepiness is caused by abnormal sleep quantity or sleep quality. Amongst others, multiple neurological, psychological, cardiac and pulmonary disorders may contribute. Risk factors for excessive sleepiness include obesity, depression, extremes of age and insufficient sleep. In the clinical setting, two of the most commonly encountered causes are obstructive sleep apnoea and periodic limb movement disorder. There is continuing discussion of the mechanisms by which these disorders cause daytime symptoms, with intermittent nocturnal hypoxia, sleep fragmentation and autonomic dysregulation identified as important factors. The increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea in obese subjects does not fully account for the increased rates of daytime sleepiness in this population and there is evidence to suggest that it is caused by metabolic factors and chronic inflammation in obese individuals. Sleepiness is also more common in those reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety disorders and significantly impacts their quality of life. Clinicians should be aware of factors which put their patients at high risk of daytime sleepiness, as it is a debilitating and potentially dangerous symptom with medico-legal implications. Treatment option should address underlying contributors and promote sleep quantity and sleep quality by ensuring good sleep hygiene. However, stimulant medication may be indicated in some cases to allow for more normal daytime functioning.",

      "title": "Recognize \"Sleepy\" Workers by Asking the Right Questions Early in the Rehabilitation Process",
      "abstract": "Recognize Sleepy Workers by Asking the Right Questions Early in the Rehabilitation Process The impact of sleepiness upon job performance has smoldered as a neglected issue for many years. In fact, only disastrous events, particularly involving nuclear power and the aviation industry, have succeeded in bringing the problem to the attention of both the general public and regulatory agencies. At present, obvious aggravating factors--external to, yet imposed upon the worker (such as shift work and jet lag) are under intense scrutiny. However, a major dilemma remains. Essentially, we have tripped over the razor-sharp tip of a massive iceberg. There are many employees inherently incapable of maintaining adequate alertness for job performance, irrespective of hours and work conditions. For example, the leading cause of severe sleepiness encountered by sleep medicine specialists is sleep apnea. This syndrome is characterized by repeated cessation of breathing during sleep. Individuals may struggle violently to overcome closure of the upper airway hundreds of times each night. Their consequent exhaustion may be compounded further by the serious drops in blood oxygen levels that many of them demonstrate. Potential complications, aside from incapacitating sleepiness, include heart failure, hypertension, and risk of sleep-related heart attacks, seizures, strokes and sudden death. It seems incredible that such a dramatic condition in fact is common--occurring in approximately one out of every fifty adult men. Narcolepsy, an often inherited disorder that appears due to neurochemical imbalances in the brain, was first described over 100 years ago and had been thought rare. We now recognize that it has a prevalence of roughly 1:1000 or greater, such that it is at least as prevalent as multiple sclerosis. A large number of additional men and women are diagnosed as having idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnolence: likely due to yet other perturbations in brain chemistry, that eventuate in severe sleepiness without classic narcolepsy. A variety of other physical causes of impaired wakefulness similarly abound. In short, we now realize that the magnitude of the population affected by these disorders is immense. No less striking is the severity of job impairment experienced by this group. Narcolepsy has been most thoroughly studied in this latter regard. Broughton and co-workers (1984) contrasted life effects of narcolepsy and epilepsy and found that although a higher percentage of people with narcolepsy currently were working (73.3 vs 55.0), people with narcolepsy more often reported reduced work performance due to the underlying condition: 61.4 vs 30.3. Narcolepsy also was reported as having led to a variety of specific problems: reduction in earnings in 31.8%, prevention of promotion in 22.7%, fear of job loss in 45.5%, and actual job loss in 23.3%. A more recent and somewhat larger survey (Alaia, 1988) cited reduced job performance in 84.6%, resulting job change in 57.1%, failure to receive promotion in 37.9%, and accidents on the job in 18.9%, with narcolepsy stated to have influenced initial job choice in 42.9%. At the same time, workers whose impairment derives from excessive sleepiness tend to be excellent rehabilitation candidates. For example, nearly all sleep apnea patients are restored to full alertness if their nocturnal breathing abnormality is corrected, now possible in the vast majority due to the advent of newer treatment approaches. Recognition: The Challenge Two obvious questions arise. First, if the prevalence of these disorders is so great, where have they been? Second, if effective treatment indeed is possible, why might individuals with sleep disorders still present for rehabilitation? Odds would favor many rehabilitation counselors already having seen workers unemployed as a direct consequence of excessive sleepiness--without ever knowing that such was the basic problem. …",

Humans evolved for 7–9 hr of night sleep, to be awake during the day and have a consistent sleep/wake routine. Fatigue complicated by sleep–wake patterns that are contrary to biological programming. In the modern work environment, fatigue-related performance decrements are common. Many body processes fluctuate on a 24-hr rhythm based on an internal timing mechanism or number of internal clocks which normally work in synchrony unless disrupted by scheduling changes. Sleep inertia is degraded vigilance, increased drowsiness and diminished performance that occurs immediately after awakening. Inter-individual differences exist in fatigue susceptibility and effectiveness of countermeasures.",

Parasomnias are divided into two categories: those that occur during nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and those occurring during rapid eye movement sleep (REM). NREM parasomnias include sleepwalking and night terrors. Examples of REM parasomnias are nightmares, hypnogogic hallucinations, and REM behavior disorder. Although many parasomnias in themselves are considered benign, they are clinically relevant as some have been shown to be associated with psychiatric illness (e.g., nightmare disorder) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., REM behavior disorder).",

The two overall epilepsy types are generalized and focal. Focal epilepsy most commonly indicates a focal brain injury like traumatic brain injury or tumor. In contrast, generalized epilepsy is due to a genetic etiology, not necessarily inherited. An epilepsy diagnosis is clinically made and can be supported by typical EEG and MRI findings. Nearly 4% of people develop epilepsy, with the largest peak during later years and the second peak during childhood. Nearly 70% of people are seizure-free after five years, whether via control with medications or, less commonly, the epilepsy itself remits. Life expectancy for epilepsy patients is lower. A key contributor to epilepsy mortality is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Uncontrolled generalized tonic clonic seizures are a key risk factor for SUDEP.",

A video-polysomnography revealed periodic leg movements (figure) and arousal followed by sleep episodes while standing, rhythmic marching, and falling (videos 1 and 2 on the Neurology ® Web site at [Neurology.org][1]). A reevaluation of his history revealed symptoms compatible with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Rotigotine1 proved very effective, supporting the diagnosis of RLS. Periodic leg movement disorder leading to sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder could also be considered. Automatic behavior denotes severe sleep deprivation2 and may represent a non-REM parasomnia. Severe RLS may present with automatic behavior complicating its diagnosis.

      "abstract": "In Reply . —Dr Jenkins has touched on an important and challenging problem that both researchers and clinicians face in diagnosing serious depression in medical inpatients. Are symptoms of depression due to organic illness and thus likely to respond to treatment of the underlying physical illness, or, on the other hand, are they of psychological origin and thus require counseling or antidepressant therapy? This difficulty, in part, arises from a lack of distinction between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Fleeting depressive symptoms (such as decreased energy, difficulty sleeping) are quite common among acutely ill medical patients (in or outside of the Veterans Administration system); however, such symptoms are often different in intensity and duration from those that comprise a major depressive disorder. The latter (by DSM-III-R criteria) requires a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day for 2 weeks or longer, and the simultaneous presence of a constellation of",

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "title": "UNEXPECTED AUTOPSY FINDINGS IN UNEXPECTED DEATHS.",
      "abstract": "Death is usually anticipated. Physiological death resulting from senility and the gradual wearing out of organs and tissues is probably an exceptional occurrence. The end usually comes as a culmination of some disease of whose ravages the clinician and the patient are aware. Sometimes it comes with suddenness as the result of an accident, of the imbibition of a poison, or of a sudden turn for the worse in an already existing disease, and sometimes it comes for no apparent reason. It is the unexpected cases of death to which reference is made in this paper. When one hears of an unexpected death, one's mind usually turns to two, or at most three, of the systems of the body. One thinks first perhaps of the circulatory system, and secondarily of the nervous and respiratory systems, and as a matter of fact, the majority of cases of unexpected death may be referred to one of these. But in the course of autopsy experience one learns that there is a wide range, in lesions of these systems, and that the primary cause of the demise may occasionally originate in other systems and tissues, although the actual termination of life may be due to the effect upon one of the three systems previously mentioned. The cases reported have, with a few exceptions been selected from a series of about 1200 autopsies performed at the Hamilton General Hospital during the past ten years. Many of the more unusual observations have been revealed in autopsies done on cases, which have been the subjects of coroner's investigations, and where little or no previous clinical history was available. No doubt some of the so-called unexpected findings",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

Body motility, eye movements, respiratory and cardiac rhythms, chin myogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and crying were evaluated by careful observation and by polygraphic recordings for periods of from 1 to 2 hr. A very rich and continuous motility is described consisting of rapid jerks, either diffuse or localized, and of slow movements. Rhythmic movements of the chin or peribuccal area occur in bursts and are particularly striking. The paucity of rapid eye movements (REM) is also remarkable. The EEG is composed of silent periods interrupted by discontinuous polymorphic activity. The fixation of the cardiac rate, the absence of periodic respiration and of apneic periods are the most important vegetative phenomena. Crying occurs in short periods rarely lasting more than 20 sec. The state of these previable prematures cannot be considered as waking; it seems to be a very immature state of sleep that differs from both the quiet and the active sleep of full‐term newborns. This atypical sleep, which appears to be present in other species characterized by a great degree of immaturity at birth, does not give any evidence of cyclic organization.",

      "abstract": "Central poststroke pain (CPSP), formerly known as thalamic pain syndrome of Déjerine and Roussy, is a central neuropathic pain occurring in patients affected by stroke. It is one manifestation of central pain, which is broadly defined as central neuropathic pain caused by lesions or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Thalamic pain was first described 100 years ago by Déjerine and Roussy and has been described as \"among the most spectacular, distressing, and intractable of pain syndromes\". CPSP is characterized by constant or intermittent pain and is associated with sensory abnormalities, particularly of thermal sensation. While the pain is frequently described as burning, scalding, or burning and freezing, other symptoms are usually vague and hard to characterize, making an early diagnosis particularly difficult. In fact, those who develop CPSP may no longer be under the care of health care professionals when their symptoms begin to manifest, resulting in misdiagnosis or a significant delay before treatment begins. Diagnosis is further complicated by cognitive and speech limitations that may occur following stroke, as well as by depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. Patients may also exhibit spontaneous dysesthesia and the stimulus-evoked sensory disturbances of dysesthesia, allodynia and hyperalgesia. The present study offers a historical reference point for future clinical and basic research into this elusive type of debilitating pain.",

      "title": "Sleep as a Component of Health in Areas of Armed Conflict and Disaster",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital physiological and psychological process essential for overall health and well-being, yet it is often severely disrupted in areas affected by armed conflict and disasters. In these environments, civilians frequently become internally displaced or refugees, experiencing fragmented or reduced sleep due to factors such as constant noise from drones and airstrikes, overcrowded shelters, and pervasive fear for personal safety. These sleep disturbances, including but not limited to insomnia and nightmares, are not merely secondary effects of a conflict or disaster but can also exacerbate stress responses, weaken immune function, and increase the risk of psychological toll and manifestations such as anxiety and depression. Public health initiatives increasingly recognize sleep disruption as both a predictor and consequence of trauma, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. However, the implementation of such interventions is often hindered by resource constraints in conflict and disaster zones. Elevated cortisol levels and inflammatory cytokines have been linked to prolonged sleep loss, which can further intensify stress responses and increase susceptibility to infections. Addressing sleep disturbances is crucial for improving overall health outcomes for the affected population and facilitating recovery and reintegration as crises subside. Integrating sleep-focused strategies into humanitarian and public health responses is essential for mitigating the long-term psychological and physical impacts of conflict and disaster, ultimately supporting the restoration of healthier and more stable communities.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleep‐related complaints affect 50–80% of patients on dialysis. Sleep disorders impair quality of life significantly. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disruption has a profound impact both on an individual and on a societal level. The etiology of sleep disorders is often multifactorial: biologicsocialand psychological factors play a role. This is especially true for insomniawhich is the most common sleep disorder in different populationsincluding patients on dialysis. Biochemical and metabolic changeslifestyle factorsdepressionanxietyand other underlying sleep disorders can all have an effect on the development and persistence of sleep disruptionleading to chronic insomnia. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleepor having nonrestorative sleep. It is also associated with daytime consequencessuch as sleepiness and fatigueand impaired daytime functioning. In most casesthe diagnosis of insomnia is based on the patient's historybut in some patients objective assessment of sleep pattern may be necessary. Optimally the treatment of insomnia involves the combination of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. In some cases acute insomnia resolves spontaneouslybut if left untreatedit may lead to chronic sleep problems. The treatment of chronic insomnia is often challenging. There are only a few studies specifically addressing the management of this sleep disorder in patients with chronic renal disease. Considering the polypharmacy and altered metabolism in this patient populationtreatment trials are clearly needed. This article reviews the diagnosis of sleep disorders with a focus on insomnia in patients on dialysis.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder and one of the most debilitating and baffling mental illnesses known. It is a disease that makes it difficult for a person to tell the difference between real and unreal experiences, to think logically, to have normal emotional responses to others, and to behave normally in social situations. People with schizophrenia may also have difficulty in remembering, talking, and behaving appropriately. Schizophrenia is one of the more serious mental illnesses and can have a variety of symptoms. This illness varies in its severity from one individual to another, and also within any one afflicted individual from one time period to another. Sometimes these symptoms come on suddenly, but most often, the illness develops slowly over months or even years. At first, symptoms may go unnoticed or may be confused with those of other conditions. For example, people with Schizophrenia may feel tense, be unable to concentrate, or have difficulty sleeping. Those afflicted also become increasingly isolated and socially withdrawn. As the illness progresses, the symptoms often become more bizarre, and are described as symptoms of psychosis. The person develops peculiar behavior, speaks nonsensically, and may develop hallucinations, that is, they may see, feel, smell, or hear things that are not really there. During the psychotic phase, people with Schizophrenia may also suffer from delusions, i.e., have thoughts that are fragmented, bizarre, and have no basis in reality. They may also develop disordered thinking and speech patterns in which the associations among their thoughts and words are very loose. Schizophrenia seems to worsen and improve in cycles known as relapses and remission, respectively. At times, patients may appear relatively normal, but usually there will be repeated episodes of the illness that will cause the symptoms to reappear. It is one of the most common serious illnesses that can cause repeated hospitalizations. Antipsychotic medications (often called neuroleptics) are very effective in controlling the symptoms of the illness. Because each person with Schizophrenia has a unique mix of symptoms no single medication works best for all people. Also, there is a high percentage of patients who do not comply with their medications due to bad side effects that they could not tolerate. However, a new generation of these antipsychotic medications has been shown to reduce the side effects, and more significantly has improved the quality of life of patients. Because of these new drugs, patients now are more integrated into society, some of them are able to graduate from college and many are gainfully employed and productive members of our society.",

The specific sounds reported during episodes of exploding head syndrome are quite variable and can include perceptions of fireworks, lightening cracks, or nondescript screaming. Visual experiences (e.g., light flashes) may also be involved. A variety of etiological theories exist for exploding head syndrome, but the most popular of these implicates abnormal surges of neuronal activity within the brainstem during sleep-wake transitions—surges which then are perceived as the loud and startling sounds. Although episodes are more common than initially thought and can have important clinical impacts on sufferers, exploding head syndrome is still a relatively unknown disorder.

In this chapter, the various anxiety disorders are defined and described according to widely-used schemata. The include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, ,Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. The epidemiology, treatment and sleep aspects are discussed. The physiology of Anxiety Disorders and the relationship to arousal, stress, and sleep-wake regulation are outlined.. Polysomnographic studies document limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clearpicture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder12.1 INTRODUCTIONAnxiety disorders are the most frequent type of psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 29% in the general population (Kessler et al., 2005). Anxious individuals have substantial disability and functional impairment (Roy-Byrne et al., 1999). Several studies have examined anxiety symptoms in people with sleep problems. In a parallel fashion, others have evaluated sleep problems in anxious individuals. Thus, among people complaining of sleep problems, 35-50% is comorbidly anxious. One study reported a 17 fold overrepresentation of clinically significant anxiety among those with sleep difficulties (Taylor et al., 2005).",

Especially, SDB has been gathering much attention as sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) in clinical physicians last three decades. SAS is characterized with heavy snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity. Pathophysiology of SAS is repeated obstructions of upper airway (pharyngeal sites) during sleep, so that marked hypoxemia and arousals occur. When SAS is severe and hypoxemia continues for long time, cardiovascular systems are much affected. Recent studies demonstrate that SAS is directly associated with hypertension, stroke, cardiac failure, and cardiac death. Another important clinical problem in patients with SAS is excessive daytime sleepiness that occurs due to repeated arousals during sleep. It has been reported that patients with SAS have more traffic car accidents. SAS impairs not only physical conditions but also mental and social conditions. Sleep disturbances, such as sleep loss, insomnia, and hypersomnia are also major health problem. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrated that sleep disturbances are common in general population. To understand the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of sleep disturbances are clinically important and useful for general physicians.",

The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

      "abstract": "We present a case of recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis in a 52-year-old male of Indo-Caribbean ethnicity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recurrent sleep paralysis is a widely under-reported yet worrisome symptom of various sleep disorders. Although a benign condition in most cases, sleep paralysis in a minority of patients causes great distress. Some patients exhibit bedroom avoidance behavior, whereas others experience bedtime anxiety, making it difficult to fall asleep. This leads to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, which can greatly impact a person's overall health. As in our case, this led to a vicious \"lack of sleep\" cycle where a patient who had bedtime anxiety and could not fall asleep, owing to his recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, also had poor quality sleep secondary to his OSA. This increases morbidity and has many potential consequences, which may include cardiovascular events, cognitive decline, and motor vehicular accidents. Sometimes, simply addressing the underlying medical condition cures the recurrent sleep paralysis as in this case where continuous positive airway pressure for OSA cured the recurrent sleep paralysis. One of our goals is to raise awareness of recurrent sleep paralysis so that patients can seek medical help and would not have to live with the anguish of the condition. Coming forward will also assist medical researchers in furthering their understanding of sleep paralysis.",

      "title": "ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SILEXAN IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ANXIETY SYNDROMES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Anxiety and depressive diseases represent leading causes of burden worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and suffering [1]. Although the heterogeneous clinical presentations do not always fully meet the criteria required for a diagnosis of a full-blown psychiatric disease as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the so-called “subthreshold” or “subsyndromal” severity consistently showed a long-term negative impact on general health, life quality and functionality, and hence a decreased working capability in the affected individuals [2, 3]. For both, subsyndromal as well as full-blown manifestations, beneficial clinical effects on anxious, depressive, psychosomatic and cognitive symptoms and favorable safety profile lacking pharmacological interactions, undesirable sedation, withdrawal symptoms, or abuse potential were repeatedly confirmed for Silexan in patients with primary anxiety syndromes [4, 5]. Additionally, in-vitro studies indicated stimulation of synaptic plasticity, and in rats repeated administration of Silexan decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test [6]. Aims &amp; Objectives Based on the available clinical and preclinical international evidence, the pharmacological profile suggests that Silexan, a proprietary active substance produced from Lavandula angustifolia Miller flowers that has been approved in many countries for the oral treatment of anxiety disorders, may also have an antidepressant effect [6]. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on data from placebo- controlled clinical trials with Silexan at a daily dose of 80 mg [7]. Methods The present meta-analysis investigating comorbid depressive symptoms was conducted based on five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials performed with Silexan in subthreshold anxiety (n = 3) and generalized anxiety disorders (n = 2) [7]. Results The results of the item depressed mood assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale clearly showed that Silexan has a beneficial effect on co-occurring depressive symptoms in these patients [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 315 patients suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder [7]. Silexan was significantly superior to placebo regarding the antidepressant efficacy measured with the Montgomery Å sberg Depression Rating Scale as well as the anxiolytic efficacy measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [7]. Discussion &amp; Conclusion Based on these encouraging results and the need for an antidepressant agent with a beneficial efficacy and tolerability profile lacking unfavorable pharmacological interactions or withdrawal symptoms harming the quality of life, especially in patients with milder forms of depression [4, 7, 8], the antidepressant efficacy of Silexan is currently being investigated in an international randomized placebo-and reference-controlled phase III trial in patients with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (EudraCT Number: 2020-000688-22).

      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

      "abstract": "Perhaps as many as 5% of adults are excessively sleepy to a clinically relevant extent.1 The comparable figure for children is not known, but sleepiness is associated with many different conditions and, although a neglected topic, it can be the cause of serious psychological and social disadvantage.2Narcolepsy is by no means the most common cause of excessive sleepiness. Nonetheless, it is not the rarity once supposed, and poses special problems of recognition and management, especially in young people. The purpose of this article is mainly to review the clinical picture of narcolepsy in children and adolescents, emphasising the need for paediatricians, child psychiatrists, and others to take a wide view of the ways in which the condition can show itself. The clinical picture is often very different from that of the fully developed narcolepsy syndrome in adults. It is, therefore, at particular risk of either being overlooked or misconstrued.\n\nNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder, the main classic feature of which is excessive sleepiness during the day, with recurrent episodes of irresistible sleep (sleep attacks). In its fully developed form the “narcolepsy syndrome” also includes sudden loss of muscle tone in response to strong emotion (cataplexy), vivid dream-like experiences before falling asleep (hypnagogic hallucinations) or on waking (hypnopompic hallucinations), and episodes of inability to move after waking in the morning (sleep paralysis). Estimates for the occurrence of the non-sleepiness (“ancillary”) components of the syndrome are: cataplexy (all cases where cataplexy is required for the diagnosis of narcolepsy; however, others accept that in about 20% of cases cataplexy is not present), hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations (50–60%), and sleep paralysis (40%). These symptoms occur in various combinations and less than half of those with narcolepsy develop all four of them. In narcolepsy, overnight sleep is generally disrupted, causing some degree …",

Paroxysmal non-epileptic disorders are defined as episodes of sudden onset and short duration that imitate an epileptic seizure, caused by a brain dysfunction of diverse origin that, unlike epilepsy, is not due to excessive neuronal discharge. Its incidence is much higher than epilepsy and it can appear at any age. It is important for diagnosis to analyze the triggering factors, the details of each episode, physical examination and only proceed to basic complementary tests such as video-electroencephalogram in case of doubt or for diagnostic confirmation.

      "title": "Correlation of Stigma with Self-compassion in Patients with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background & Aims: The bipolar disorder is important mental disorder, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression.This chronic and complex disease affects the mood of the patient, causing continuous and abnormal mood changes from extremely good to extremely poor and depressed.These fluctuations often last for weeks or months.Frequent episodes of depression and mania affect the functioning of the individual in personal, professional, family, social, and cultural domains.Patients with the bipolar disorder experience a phenomenon known as stigma.Stigma is defined as a set of cognitions and behaviors that are activated by labeling, leading to social exclusion and isolation.The stigma of mental illness distinguishes the patients from other populations.The stigma of mental illness renders the patients incapacitated and socially isolated.In addition, the experience of stigma decreases the quality of life and health-seeking behaviors of the patients, threatening their socio-economic health.Subsequently, the social participation of patients with mental illness is disrupted, and they refrain from seeking social assistance.In fact, stigma leads to the rejection of patients with mental illness by the society, disrupting their emotional regulation and making them unable to have proper emotional regulation strategies.Furthermore, the stigma of mental illness causes the patients not to have appropriate coping strategies for the disease, hide their medical history from the medical staff, and avoid communicating with their friends after discharge from the hospital.Given the importance of the concept of stigma, identifying the positively correlated behaviors seems essential.Self-compassion is a positive behavior that may be associated with stigma.Individuals with high self-compassion are more likely to accept negative life events and have more accurate self-assessments and better mental health.Self-compassion is an important factor in the adaptive responses to the mood problems in patients with a history of recurrent depression.High self-compassion reduces the mental vulnerability of patients with mental illness to problems, their depression and social anxiety, shame caused by the illness, and selfcriticism.In contrast, the lack of self-compassion leads to self-judgment, a sense of further isolation, and a rush of negative emotions about oneself, which ultimately lead to the loss of intimacy in the relationships with others.Low self-compassion is present in a wide range of individuals with mental disorders and causes emotional distress, so that individuals with mental illness and low self-compassion are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.The present study aimed to assess the correlation between stigma and self-compassion in patients with the bipolar disorder.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 200 patients with the bipolar disorder admitted to Iran Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran, who were selected via continuous sampling.Data were collected using a demographic data form and stigma and self-compassion tools.The demographic data form included data on age, gender, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation status, family history of mental disorders, number of family members, and number of admissions.The researcher evaluated the validity and reliability of the instruments.To determine validity, the instruments were provided to seven professors of the department of psychiatric nursing at Iran and",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome is defined when five or more central apneas and/or hypopneas are present per hour of sleep, more than 50% of all respiratory events. CSA usually occur during NREM stage and rarely during REM. CSA is important to recognize because of complications ranging from frequent nighttime awakenings,sleepiness to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We present a 40 year old female patient with rare CSA during REM sleep and dream enactment. Report of Case 40yo African American female with history of loud snoring, witnessed sleep apnea, and daytime fatigue. She reported nightmares, sleep talking, and acting out her dreams without injury. Epworth sleepiness score was 5 /24. Her past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety. She has no history of head trauma, no neurologic or cardiovascular disorders. Her medications include fluoxetine and,quetiapine. She denied substance use, narcotic use, or alcohol use. Her level 1 sleep study showed predominantly REM-associated central sleep apneas which is rare. She also was observed to have loss of REM sleep muscle atonia suggestive of REM Behavior disorder. Her sleep architecture was atypical with decreased N3 sleep stage. REM sleep duration was adequate. She was noted to have loss of REM muscle atonia based on AASM guidelins elevated chin EMG, excessive transient muscle activity, and witnessed movement during REM stage via video monitoring. During the study, she had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 13.1 per hour of sleep, Central apneas were predominantly noted during REM stage, 10 per hour, comprised of 50% of her respiratory events. The minimum SpO2 value with CSA was 94%. She had normal sinus rhythm. Her sleep was fragmented. A total arousals were 28.4/hour,and 7.9/hour were respiratory arousals, and the rest were spontaneous arousals. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 to 60 %. Her room air arterial blood gas was normal with PaC02 of 37 mmHg. MRI of the brain/brainstem was ordered given her atypical REM sleep. She had no acute intracranial abnormalities. There is a non specific finding of a low lying cerebellar tonsils without evidence of Chiari I malformation. Conclusion Our patient has rare idiopathic central apnea in REM stage and is third case reported. She also has loss of muscle atonia during REM with dream enactment which is also rare in her age group. Injury precaution advised.",

In fact, adolescent sleep problems commonly co-occur with depression and anxiety, and likely share complex bidirectional relationships over time. Evidence indicates that sleep problems, particularly insomnia, often precede the emergence of the onset of depression in adolescents, and may mediate the sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression. An important future direction is to explore sleep improvement interventions tailored to the unique developmental needs of adolescents, which may represent a novel approach to prevent adolescent onset mental disorders.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

The confused elder is more often anxious, very disoriented, with poor onirism, disturbed sleep, ideas of persecution and behavior disorders. Even if a multiple causality is usual, initiating circumstances come principally from an affective source. There is rupture with customary situation of the elder which hold a plurality of risk factors. These confusional disorders increase with aging and cognitive impairment. Late life delusional subject has also persecutory ideation without dissociation but with emotional reactions and affective changes. Different factors promote birth of late life delusion (personality features, isolation, sensory defect...). On psychodynamic way, these two disorders are issued from a breakdown followed by a more or less durable appointment. Confusion agrees with a somatic and psychic regression (consciousness disorganization). This is an elder's attempt to prevent anxiety. Late life delusion lays on denial and projective mecanisms. It is jointed with prejudice and intrusion (with regard to ownership, health and reputation). This is an elder's attempt to establish defences against depression. In the two situations, treatment consists on a biological regulation associated with psychodynamic approach taking elder personality, actual condition and recent life events into account.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

Patients with insomnia view their problem in very emotional terms and for them it is very serious. And when patients see improvement, they are very grateful patients. Additionally, a complaint of insomnia increases morbidity in the elderly, for reasons ranging from falls to coronary events. Utilization of health care resources is higher in patients with severe insomnia. Insomnia should be considered a serious complaint from the patient because of the associated impairment of psychosocial function and quality of life.

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are negative emotional states familiar to us all through personal experience. Less familiar are severe states of depression, in particular, which can actually shorten the lives of sufferers by over a decade. The relationship of these very severe states of illness to the milder cases more common earlier in development is important. Most patients who have suffered from depression will suffer from further episodes during their lifetime, and an early onset may make recurrence more likely. A number of factors increase the risk for depression, including family history, stressful life events, early life experiences, personality (particularly the traits of neuroticism and perfectionism) and mood lability (marked ups and downs). Sleep disturbance may both provoke and/or signal the onset of mood disorder. Sleep is therefore doubly important as a gateway to treatment. Understanding more about how sleep interacts with the established risk factors would allow vulnerable young people to be identified earlier for more effective intervention. Early identification of sleep disorder and depression allows psychological treatments to be used, which are less effective once a full depressive episode and a cascade of neurobiological and psychological effects have occurred.",

The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

In their developmental sequence there is at first crying, then a long, sustained expiratory cry without a succeeding inspiration; cyanosis replaces the previous flushing of the face (although sometimes pallor is more marked than cyanosis); then there is a stiffening of the limbs, usually in extension, followed by loss of consciousness, relaxation, inspiration, and, in a short time, recovery. In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum—a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case,",

However, the sleep-wake rhythm may be out of sync with the light-dark cycle or endogenously out of sync, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in activities of daily living. Sleep disorders are classified by the American Sleep Disorders Association, as intrinsic dyssomnias, extrinsic dyssomnias, parasomnias, or medical/psychiatric sleep disorders. Circa¬dian sleep disorders have been categorized separately to recognize that in most cases the etiology of circadian dis¬turbances is a mix of internal and environmental factors or a temporary mismatch between the two. Symptoms are usually insomnia or hypersomnia, common symptoms in patients with circadian sleep disorders although other causes can be attributed and must be excluded before a diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder is made. In the patient without other sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool in assessing circadian sleep disorders. These records should be kept for 2 weeks or more, as a disturbance due to job changes or travel across time zones can have effects on sleep and daytime alertness weeks after the event.

This sleep disorder is a final common pathway for many people who initially develop sleeplessness in the context of acute stressors (e.g., pain, job loss), but then acquire a form of \"learned\" sleeplessness as they become increasingly overconcerned about their unsatisfying sleep patterns. Patients report reduced total sleep time, with increased sleep latency (greater than 30 min), or increased wakeafter sleep onset time, though these findings are not always corroborated on PSG studies. Patients with this form of chronic insomnia are often vexed by its seemingly unpredictable nature from night to night, but to be diagnosed symptoms must be present on three or more nights per week, for more than 1 month (DSM-IV) or 6 months (ICSD-2). The essential feature of this form of insomnia is a pattern of sleep disturbance that evolves over time as a result of psychological distress that triggers unhelpful behaviors and physiological arousal. This chapter will summarize the current understanding of the development of this disorder, and the clinical approaches that may be useful to resolve it.",

When sleep starts are excessive, they are considered a parasomnia and included in the category of sleep-wake transition parasomnias by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders [2]. They can cause frequent awakenings and sleep onset difficulty. The syndrome was first described by S Weir Mitchell [3]. This peculiar type of event consists of a massive myoclonic jerk in which the main muscles involved are the axial ones. Sleep starts can be accompanied by a dream, or the impression of falling. Epileptic seizures and parasomnias are the two major groups of sleep-related paroxysmal disorders in childhood. Epileptic seizures are usually characterized by random occurrence, stereotyped behavior, brief duration, and hypertonus or clonic jerks [4]. The pathogenesis of sleep starts is unknown. However, they involve partial activation of the central nervous system producing skeletal muscle activity. This could arise as a consequence of a synchronous volleys of pyramidal tract activity arising during the transition from wakefulness to sleep [5].

However, the origin of such dreams remains largely unexplained, and there have been no attempts to reconcile repetitive traumatic nightmares with nontraumatic nightmares, dysphoric dreams that do not awaken the dreamer, or with more normative dreams. Based on recent research in cognitive neuroscience, sleep physiology, fear conditioning, and emotional-memory regulation, we propose a multilevel neurocognitive model that unites waking and sleeping as a conceptual framework for understanding a wide spectrum of disturbed dreaming. We propose that normal dreaming serves a fear-extinction function and that nightmares reflect failures in emotion regulation. We further suggest that nightmares occur as a result of two processes that we term affect load—a consequence of daily variations in emotional pressures—and affect distress—a disposition to experience events with high levels of negative emotional reactivity.",

The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical.

      "abstract": "The potentially adverse impact of poor sleep quality, insomnia, and other sleep disorders on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been the subject of increasing exploration over the past decade. Obstructive sleep apnea has been the most extensively studied sleep disorder in relation to hypertension, and is thought to be causally related through mechanisms including heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and vascular endothelial dysfunction that are triggered by sleep-disordered breathing.1 A growing body of research evidence has also revealed relationships between insomnia and CVD. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and is defined by subjective reports of difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking too early.2 With insomnia, both sleep quality and duration are often impaired. Although a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be based on self-report alone, objectively assessed insomnia features using polysomnography reveals longer sleep onset latency, more frequent nocturnal awakenings, and prolonged periods of wakefulness during the sleep period relative to normal sleepers.3 Observational studies employing objective sleep measures show that individuals with insomnia are more likely to have CVD, even after controlling for comorbid sleep disorders, and other potentially confounding comorbidities.4 Short sleep duration has also been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, higher blood pressure (BP), metabolic syndrome, greater coronary calcification, and higher levels of stress hormones.5 An important pathway through which sleep may affect CVD risk is through its relationship with BP, with substantial support for an association between insomnia and incident hypertension.6, 7 For example, in a prospective study of 786 men and women from the Penn State Cohort, those with chronic insomnia, determined by polysomnographic study and subjective reports of sleep problems persisting for over a year, were at over twice the risk of developing hypertension over a 7.5-year follow-up period. Furthermore, chronic insomnia coupled with short sleep duration (<6 hours) was associated with a fourfold increased risk of developing hypertension.8 Other studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, have reported similar observations, reinforcing the perspective that insomnia, when coupled with short sleep duration, may be especially hazardous in terms of its association with hypertension and CVD.9-11 Poor sleep quality is a widespread problem, commonly reported by patients with a variety of medical and mental health conditions,12, 13 as well as among those with diagnosed sleep disorders. However, the potentially broad impact of poor self-reported sleep quality on CVD risk has received relatively little attention. In the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Lo and colleagues report14 an informative meta-analysis examining the association between subjective sleep quality and BP. The authors include data from studies based on over 45 000 participants spanning five continents and provide formal analyses of studies that assessed subjective sleep quality using the well-established and validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.15, 16 Their analyses showed that poor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher BP and an increased likelihood of hypertension. The impact of poor sleep quality is perhaps likely to be most conspicuously reflected in BP during the nighttime sleep period. Ambulatory BP monitoring studies have established that BP typically exhibits a circadian rhythm characterized by a fall in pressure during the nighttime sleep period. Relative to daytime pressure, a nighttime dip in BP of ≥10% is considered normal and individuals with this level of BP dipping are referred to as BP dippers, whereas a nighttime BP dip of <10% describes nondippers.17 Lo and colleagues found that in the subset of studies in their meta-analysis, which used both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ambulatory BP monitoring, BP dippers were characterized by better sleep quality than nondippers. Other studies, using subjective as well as objective measures of sleep quality derived from polysomnography and actigraphy, also have shown poor sleep quality to be associated with a blunting of the normal nighttime dip in BP.18-22 The nondipping circadian BP profile is associated with target organ damage, including cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease23, 24 and is a strong prognostic indicator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for both patients with and those without hypertension.23, 25-28 This evidence underscores the importance of BP measured during the nighttime sleep period, reflecting its greater prognostic significance than clinic BP, or ambulatory BP assessed during the daytime.29 Nonetheless, the physiological mechanisms accounting for blunted nighttime BP dipping and elevated nighttime BP are not well understood.30 Sympathetic nervous system activity normally shows a substantial decline from daytime waking activities to nighttime sleep, but the magnitude of this decline is attenuated in the context of a nondipping nighttime BP profile.21, 31, 32 Heightened nighttime sympathetic nervous system activity would favor peripheral vascular constriction, resulting in abnormally elevated systemic vascular resistance during the sleep period.33 The contribution of vascular disease to a blunted nighttime BP dip is supported by observations that a nondipping circadian BP profile is approximately twice as common in patients with coronary heart disease compared with age-matched healthy controls.34, 35 Blunted BP dipping has also been associated with impaired vascular endothelial function in women with untreated hypertension.35 As might be anticipated, in a study of men and women with hypertension, the hemodynamic mechanism related to a nondipping BP profile was a failure for systemic vascular resistance to show a normal decline during the nighttime sleep period.37 In view of the well-established pathophysiologic significance of elevated systemic vascular resistance in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension,38 coupled with the prognostic significance of elevated nighttime BP, it is not difficult to appreciate the potential importance that sleep quality may have in the pathogenesis of hypertensive heart disease. The available evidence therefore clearly implicates poor sleep quality and insomnia as risk factors in the cause of hypertension. It also suggests that in the context of high BP and hypertension, poor sleep quality may exacerbate hypertension by promoting target organ damage and increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the critical question of whether poor sleep quality is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension and CVD remains unanswered. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement calling for research aimed at better understanding the association between sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia with CVD.39 Despite the wealth of available evidence, it is almost all observational, and the existence of a causal relationship between insomnia and CVD remains conjecture rather than inference. However, there is some preliminary evidence suggesting that sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for hypertension. In a pilot study of 22 adults with high BP, who slept <7 h/d, 13 were randomized to a 6-week intervention designed to extend the sleep period and 9 to a control condition.40 Those in the sleep-extension group showed a postintervention increase in sleep duration of 35 minutes following the intervention, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in 24-hour BP, whereas no significant changes occurred in the control group. We now need more well-designed randomized controlled trials to test the broad hypothesis that improving sleep quality in individuals with insomnia or subjectively reported sleep problems will reduce the risk of developing hypertension, as well as help control BP in those with hypertension, ultimately reducing the risk of adverse clinical events. Examining the effects of pharmacological treatments to improve sleep would be of interest, but interventions using cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia may be especially informative. Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia is safe and effective and is the current gold standard for insomnia treatment.41 Therefore, it is ideally suited for intervention trials in healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension and/or other medical and psychiatric comorbidities. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",

Psychoanalytic observation of psychosomatic patients (and others as well) reveals that the inability to name, recognize, contain or work through one's affective states is frequently one manifestation of defensive structures of a psychotic kind (more radical than denial which deals with certain neurotic anxieties). Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are associated with a number of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders, and many psychiatric patients report symptoms such as insomnia, tiredness, fatigue, and excessive sleepiness. Despite their known negative impact on daytime functioning and quality of life, less than 10% of individuals with these symptoms visit physicians specifically for their sleeping problems. Although there are many explanations for this lack of reporting, one possibility is that individuals are often unaware of the impact of sleepiness on their daytime functioning. Therefore, the burden of identifying sleepiness and its consequences often resides with physicians and other health care professionals. This process of detection is assisted by rating scales and subjective and objective tests. Although prior discussions on these topics have focused on the understanding and identification of either excessive sleepiness or insomnia, these symptoms often coexist, introducing a clinical challenge in that it becomes unclear which of these two should become the initial focus of clinical attention. When both excessive sleepiness and insomnia coexist, a circadian rhythm sleep disorder may be present, such as jet lag type, delayed and advanced sleep phase types, and shift work type.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

It is particularly relevant to patients with Parkinson disease (PD) because sleep can have a positive, although transient, effect on symptoms that exceeds that seen with the use of levodopa dosing (i.e., “sleep benefit”). Unfortunately, all too often PD patients spend their nights in misery. It may be difficult for some of them to turn or get out of bed, and many awaken frequently to urinate. Others may drool excessively, experience leg restlessness or pains, and still others are bothered frequently by disturbing nightmares.

However, they often go unrecognized after patients leave the intensive care unit (ICU). Case Presentation . A 40-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with community-acquired pneumonia and multiorgan failure requiring mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. He developed protracted delirium and severe ICU-acquired weakness but was eventually discharged home. The patient returned to a follow-up clinic two months post-ICU discharge and revealed that he was suffering anxiety from memories in the ICU of different staff trying to harm and kill him, including being repeatedly suffocated. By providing context to the memories, the patient had significant relief in his anxiety. Conclusions . Intrusive memories contribute to psychological morbidity post critical illness, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reduced health-related quality of life. The majority of critical illness survivors do not share their intrusive or frightening memories, and therefore, most healthcare professionals are unaware of the problems they can pose. Assessment of patients’ memories from the ICU is essential and may create the opportunity to help patients place memories into context and improve psychological morbidities.",

Parasomnia overlap syndrome is a term used for parasomnias that occur in both REM and NREM sleep stages, such as catathrenia. RBD is a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep stage and is characterized by acting out dreams (oneirism), leading to unwanted motor actions such as kicking, punching, or slapping, or sudden abrupt movements that can cause unexplained injuries to self or bedpartner. Memory of the associated dream is usually preserved. Diagnosis is obtained via video polysomnography with findings of REM activity without atonia and video recording of the oneirism. Treatment starts with developing a safety plan, improving sleep hygiene, and identifying any medications or other triggers such as snoring or leg movements. Melatonin, benzodiazepines, and a few other medications are used for treatment of RBD and other REM parasomnias. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2021;51(12):560–565.]",

Acute fatigue is a normal condition or phenomenon that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue, lasting at least 6 months, does not disappear after ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs activities and contributes to various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, epileptic seizures, and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. For example, in Japan, more than one third of the general adult population complains of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it.

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

The REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Restless legs syndrome occurs with myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe syndrome of sleep apnea interacts with neurologic disorders in several ways. 1) Many patients with neurologic disorders have coexisting sleep apnea simply because obstructive sleep apnea is so common.

It causes suffering to many who go undiagnosed, and it burdens families and institutions providing care for the elderly by disabling those who might otherwise be able-bodied. What makes depression in the elderly so insidious is that neither the victim nor the health care provider may recognize its symptoms in the context of the multiple physical problems of many elderly people. Depressed mood, the typical signature of depression, may be less prominent than other depressive symptoms such as loss of appetite, sleeplessness, anergia, and loss of interest in, and enjoyment of, the normal pursuits of life. There is a wide spectrum of depressive symptoms as well as types of available therapies. Because of the many physical illnesses and social and economic problems of the elderly, individual health care providers often conclude that depression is a normal consequence",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "abstract": "In noise effect research often the awakening reaction is maintained to be the only important health related reaction. The main argument is that sleep represents a trophotropic phase (\"energy storing\"). In contrast to this awakening reactions or lying awake belong to the ergotropic phase (\"energy consuming\"). Frequent or long awakening reactions endanger therefore the necessary recovery in sleep and, in the long-run, health. Findings derived from arousal and stress hormone research make possible a new access to the noise induced nightly health risk. An arousal is a short change in sleeping condition, raising the organism from a lower level of excitation to a higher one. Arousals have the function to prevent life-threatening influences or events through activation of compensation mechanisms. Frequent occurrences of arousal triggered by nocturnal noise leads to a deformation of the circadian rhythm. Additionally, the deep sleep phases in the first part of the night are normally associated with a minimum of cortisol and a maximum of growth hormone concentrations. These circadian rhythms of sleep and neuroendocrine regulation are necessary for the physical as well as for the psychic recovery of the sleeper. Noise exposure during sleep which causes frequent arousal leads to decreased performance capacity, drowsiness and tiredness during the day. Long-term disturbances of the described circadian rhythms have a deteriorating effect on health, even when noise induced awakenings are avoided.",

This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Specific sleep stages are associated with or altered by clinical conditions such as aging, disease states, sleep disorders, and drug use. Gastric acid secretion in patients with duodenal ulcers and nocturnal angina attacks in patients with coronary disease are associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleepwalking and night terrors occur predominantly during stage 4 sleep, while attacks of dyspnea in asthmatic children occur in all stages except stage 4. Enuretic episodes occur predominantly in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In treating insomnia, drugs which are effective in the sleep laboratory are recommended. Following the withdrawal of REM suppressant hypnotics, insomnia, increased dreaming, and nightmares may occur and lead to drug dependence. If these drugs are withdrawn, very gradual withdrawal is recommended as well as informing the patient of possible increases in dream frequency and intensity.",

There is that state during the first year of the child's life in which an object removed from direct perception ceases to exist for the child.<sup>1,2</sup>It is suggested that in the act of denying, the perception of a disagreeable object is actively rejected in the hope that the ancient sequence will be repeated and the object will cease to exist. The ostrich with its head in the sand is the proverbial symbol of denial. Since the denial mechanism stems from a very early developmental stage, it is perhaps not surprising that when frank denial is seen to any appreciable degree in adults, it is in association with serious mental illness.

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

      "abstract": "The biological bases of fear and anxiety are dependent on the major brain structures, and neuronal circuits involved in emotional information processing and behavior are demarcated. Emotional and cognitive processes cannot be dissociated, even when considering such a basic emotion as fear or anxiety.[1] Extended periods of lockdown and inability to go out of home for more days itself are stressful for COVID-19 noninfected individuals. The cognitive apprehension of COVID-19 pandemic situations is critically involved in emotional distress and also influences coping strategies or defense mechanisms. Doctors and hospitals are available on priority for COVID-19 patients, and mental health issues are usually not given priority till COVID-19 cases are on rise. Young and working individuals have further stress due to responsibility of family care, future career, and financial needs. Psychologically, when the living environment changes to compulsory lockdown, people feel uneasy and anxious.[2] When the possible causes of spread for epidemic is not clear, close-minded attitudes and rumors often increase. Fear and stigma lead to further negative behavior. For example, an Indian person who was suspected to have COVID-19 infection was so fearful to spread the virus that he committed suicide.[3] It is essential to have a brief idea of available methods to remain away from fear and anxiety in lockdown. The options of coping are not exactly similar to routine conditions. It is needed to understand the difference of coping methods. There are options with self home care–based approach as described in Table 1.Table 1: Difference in stress/anxiety coping strategies in routine circumstances and COVID-19 lockdownFinancial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Insomnia generally is defined a subjective report of difficulty falling sleep, difficulty staying asleep, early awakening, or nonrestorative sleep. It is one of the most common health complaints among the general population. In pathogenesis of insomnia predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors play an important role. Predisposing factors include arousal-prone personality, elevated baseline physiologic arousal, rigid circadian system, and other individual characteristics that make one vulnerable to or set the stage for the development of insomnia. Precipitating factors are the events or conditions that trigger the insomnia. Common examples include life stressors and change of sleep-wake schedule. The perpetuating factors, such conditioning of bedtime cues with arousal, maladaptive sleep-wake habits and worries over sleeplessness, then should become the focus of the treatment. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacological methods of treatment are used in the management of insomnia. In the case of the diagnosis of transient or short-term insomnia, a basic method of treatment is usually administrating the right hypnotics and information on the sleep hygiene. In chronic insomnia, a basic treatment is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help pharmacologically by regular use of sedative and hypnotic antidepressant medication in the evening only as needed taking hypnotics drugs (no more than 2-3 times a week).",

Panic disorder, which is distinguished by recurring, unexpected attacks of fear not bound to particular situations, may also be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy and/or with clomipramin, benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the main symptom of which is a persistent, free-floating fear over a period of at least several months, may be helped through relaxation techniques, counseling and/or medication with low doses of sedating tricyclic compounds or short-term treatment with benzodiazepines.

One of the most common dyssomnias with imperative sleepiness is narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic disease that greatly affects quality of life. The present study of 57 patients shows that the negative assessment is partly due to the subjective views exhibited by the narcoleptic personality prone to underestimation, negative self-image and depressive disposition. The personality traits may be due to an adaptation reaction to the disease but also to the biological predisposition. Comparison with population data for our Republic brought no evidence of progress at education or family life being adversely affected by narcolepsy, however, decreased assertion in employment and limitation in self-realization in free time was an explicit consequence of the disease. All 57 patients reported excessive daytime sleepiness as the most discomforting symptom that in 40% of them was responsible for career curtailment in a productive age and for living on partial or full disability.",

Underlying psychiatric conditions affecting decision making capacity may be implicated. Normal aging process of organ systems and increased geriatric comorbidities render them vulnerable to accidental injuries and delayed management of treatable medical conditions in an isolated home environment. During medicolegal investigation, it is essential to identify features that differentiate from genuine elder maltreatment. Diogenes Syndrome is an extreme form of fatal self-neglect for individuals in social isolation with hoarding of rubbish or household items. This presents considerable forensic difficulties because of the mysterious circumstances, a lack of medical history, suspicious findings on the body including purging of putrefactive fluids and injuries following falls or post-mortem animal predation in a chaotic scene.",

The amnesia was described in 1964 by Fisher and Adams, and as yet about 1000 cases have been reported. Middle aged or elderly patients prevail. The attack of amnesia lasts from several to about 20 hours and begins suddenly being regarded as mental confusion. The amnesia covers recent and remote events in many years. During the attack the patient is not appearing to be ill, but is depressed not knowing what has happened. The awareness of own personality, the ability to solve logical problems and visuospatial functions are preserved. The ability to execute complex activities, e.g. car driving, is normal. The aetiology of the disorder is completely unknown. The hypotheses for explaining the syndrome are: 1. ischaemia in the posterior cerebral arteries region with transient fall of blood supply through the vertebrobasilar system, 2. epilepsy or migraine, 3. disturbed aggregation of platelets in the cerebral vessels leading to loss of vessel patency. The first hypothesis seems least plausible. Attacks of this amnesia were noted after triazolam, after thalamic infarction and cerebral angiography, in brain tumours, hydrocephalus, scleroderma, frontal lobe haemorrhage. After an attack the events occurring in it are not remembered. Recurrence of attacks is very rare. Most authors consider that the disorder is benign and regresses without sequelae or only with slight changes in cognitive functions and memory fixation.",

GAD is one of the most frequent additional diagnoses among anxiety and mood disorders. Indeed, the disorder is considered by many clinical scientists to be the basic anxiety disorder, out of which emerge the other adult emotional disorders. Furthermore, worry is pervasive throughout the mood and anxiety disorders, and it is ubiquitous among human beings in general. The importance of GAD is further reflected in the documented facts that people suffering from the problem have very high rates of medical health care utilization, high rates of absenteeism from work, significant impairments in social role functioning, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.",

      "title": "Unveiling the enigma of peduncular hallucinations: Visual hallucination following occipital lobe infarct",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Peduncular Hallucination (PH), initially delineated by Lhermitte in 1922[1] predominantly manifests as intricate visual phenomena, often endowed with realism and dynamism, frequently involving familiar figures and locales. Despite these vivid episodes, patients grapple with differentiating their hallucinations from actuality, though they generally retain a degree of insight into their hallucinatory nature. Remarkably, the authenticity of these hallucinations is so convincing that individuals frequently engage in verbal or even physical interactions with the perceived entities or environments. PH instances tend to occur more frequently during the nocturnal hours or in dimly lit settings. During interludes between these hallucinatory episodes, patients exhibit unimpaired memory and consistently provide accurate descriptions of their hallucinatory experiences, even in the presence of cognitive impairment affecting other facets of their daily lives.[2] Etiologically, the onset of PH typically follows an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event affecting the midbrain, thalamus, or pons, with posterior circulation infarction emerging as the prevailing causative factor.[3] An intriguing neurological mechanism potentially contributing to the emergence of peduncular hallucinations involves the diaschisis phenomenon. In this context, a lesion in the left occipital region may induce dysfunction in midbrain structures through a diaschisis mechanism.[4] Over a span of 2 months, the patient experienced episodes of dizziness and stumbled while walking. Fortunately, these falls did not result in any physical harm or loss of consciousness. There were no post-fall complications such as seizures, confusion, memory impairment, or bleeding. Initial days following the falls seemed normal. However, after this period, family members noticed peculiar behavior. The patient began murmuring to himself consistently throughout the day and expressed a belief that a group of 6 to 7 individuals intended to harm him. He vividly described these people and their attempts to harm him, including methods like administering poison and electrocution. Strangely, he even reported seeing vehicles like trains inside his house, animals like rabbits, and vibrant colors such as pink, yellow, red, and green surrounding him. Remarkably, these visual occurrences persisted even when he closed his eyes and took place while he was fully conscious. Although initially distressed, he gradually comprehended that these were only images, leading to a reduction in his distress. The patient's basic functioning, including self-care, appetite, and interactions with relatives, remains relatively unaffected, as stated by family members and observed behavior. Upon examination of the central nervous system, parameters such as visual acuity, color perception, and eye movements appeared normal. Pupillary reflexes were within the expected range. Motor, sensory, and cranial assessments yielded normal results. Intentional tremors were present, but rigidity was absent. The patient exhibited a wide-based gait and faced difficulties during tests like the Romberg test and in performing tasks involving alternating movements and tandem walking. He is also a known case of hypertension for the past 5 years on Telmisartan 40mg, and his Blood pressure was maintained on this medication. Despite these issues, vital signs remained stable, and other systemic examinations revealed no notable abnormalities. However, a diagnosis of Parietal Hallucinosis was established based on his CT-Brain, which revealed an infarction in the left occipital lobe, as illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1: CT brain (plain) showing the left occipital lobe infarct. The blue arrow marks shows the region of infarct in the left occipital regionThe patient commenced a daily regimen of Donepezil 5mg once daily and Melatonin 10 mg at bedtime. Following three days of consistent medication, there was a notable subjective reduction of approximately 50–60% in the frequency and vividness of visual hallucinations. In addition, the patient and their family members received psychoeducation regarding the nature and etiology of hallucinations and the underlying neurobiology. The presented case report sheds light on the intriguing and complex phenomenon of PH. PH is a rare and distinctive form of hallucination characterized by vivid and dynamic visual experiences that closely resemble perceptions yet lack external sensory stimuli. This case illustrates the typical features of PH, including the patient's struggle to differentiate between the hallucinatory experiences and reality, the realistic and complex nature of the hallucinations, and the tendency to engage in interactions with the perceived entities. The pathophysiology of PH remains under investigation. This report highlights its association with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic events affecting brain regions like the midbrain, thalamus, or pons, often linked to posterior circulation infarction.[5] These lesions disrupt neurotransmitter systems and sensory pathways, potentially due to imbalanced cholinergic and serotonergic activity.[6] Additionally, the concept of diaschisis proposes that a lesion in one area can impair interconnected regions, potentially explaining PH emergence from a lesion in the left occipital region affecting midbrain structures.[4] Treatment approaches encompass both pharmacological interventions targeting cholinergic and sleep-related pathways, as well as non-pharmacological strategies including cognitive-behavioral therapies and psychoeducation.[7] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "title": "My Dream, My Rules: Can Lucid Dreaming Treat Nightmares?",
      "abstract": "Nightmares are defined as repeated occurrences of extremely dysphoric and well-remembered dreams that usually involve subjective threats to survival, security, or physical integrity. Generally, they occur during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and lead to awakenings with distress and insufficient overnight sleep. Nightmares may occur spontaneously (idiopathic) or as recurrent nightmares. Recurrent nightmares cause significant distress and impairment in occupational and social functioning, as have been commonly observed in post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. By contrast, during lucid dreaming (LD), subjects get insight they are dreaming and may even control the content of their dreams. These features may open a way to help those who suffer from nightmare disorder through re-significations of the dream scene, i.e., knowing that they are dreaming and having control over their dream content. Thus, lucid dreamers might be able to render nightmares normal dreams, thereby assuring a restoring sleep. The aim of the present study is to review the existing literature of the use of LD as an auxiliary tool for treatment of nightmares. We conducted a careful literature search for eligible studies on the use of LD treatment for nightmares. We observed that whereas LD may be a feasible aid in the treatment of patients with nightmares through minimizing their frequency, intensity and psychological distress, the available literature is still scarce and does not provide consistent results. We conclude therefore that more research is clearly warranted for a better estimation of the effective conductance and therapeutic outcome of LD treatment in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the propensity to have recurrent and unprovoked seizures; this propensity can result from a number of underlying aetiologies. Epilepsy is thus best considered a symptom of an underlying brain disorder. A single seizure is not usually considered sufficient to make a diagnosis of epilepsy. Epileptic seizures occurring solely in association with precipitants or triggering factors are termed acute symptomatic or situation-related seizures. Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner. Lip smacking or chewing movements, grimacing, undressing, the carrying out of purposeless activities or of aimless wandering may all occur on their own or in different combinations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

Half of elderly individuals report some extent of sleep difficulties, including trouble initiating sleep, poorer sleep efficiency, increased time in bed, more night-time awakenings, earlier wake-up times and more daytime naps. The adverse effects of poor sleep in this population can include reduced memory, impaired concentration, inhibited functional performance, decreased quality of life, chronic fatigue and increased risk of cognitive decline, malaise, accidents, falls and mortality. As such, the appropriate assessment and treatment of sleep disorders, particularly in older populations, are vital. Carefully considered sleep diaries and histories are essential diagnostic tools; comorbid problems such as pain or depression and current medications should be considered as possible causes. Non-pharmacological interventions such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioural treatments should be considered first.

Parasomnias are also considered to be automatisms since the subjects sometimes do not have conscious awareness during these episodes resulting in some medico-legal consequences. Parasomnias can significantly affect the quality of sleep resulting in daytime impairments and they can also affect sleep and safety of the bed-partners. However, a thorough clinical assessment, appropriate tests where indicated, and judicious use of medications can help a vast majority of patients with parasomnia disorders.",

Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue and history and investigations should always be individualized. Management should initially aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes; however, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.

Of the many disorders associated with excessive sleepiness in the general population, the most frequent are mental health disorders, particularly depression. However, most mood disorder studies addressing hypersomnia have assessed daytime sleepiness using a single response, neglecting critical and clinically relevant information about symptom severity, duration and nighttime sleep quality. Only a few studies have used objective tools such as polysomnography to directly measure both daytime and nighttime sleep propensity in depression with normal mean sleep latency and sleep duration. Hypersomnia in mood disorders, rather than a medical condition per se, is more a subjective sleep complaint than an objective finding. Mood symptoms have also been frequently reported in hypersomnia disorders of central origin, especially in narcolepsy. Hypocretin deficiency could be a contributing factor in this condition. Further interventional studies are needed to explore whether management of sleep complaints improves mood symptoms in hypersomnia disorders and, conversely, whether management of mood complaints improves sleep symptoms in mood disorders.",

An excessive focus on diagnostic criteria for bipolar or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders risks missing this particular set of patients; defined through their dynamic presentation as much as by any cluster of symptoms or types of course. Objectives To explore the concept and relevance of oneroid-like cyclic psychosis through a clinical case and review. Methods We report the case of a 37 year old woman with bipolar disorder (three previous instances of manic episodes with psychotic symptoms) and various gynecological issues that required hormone therapy. After a couple of days having difficulty sleeping, the patient developed a clinical picture consisting of wide and sudden oscillations between hyperactive and inhibited psychomotor activity, moods of dread and ecstasy, and states of disorganized thought and childlike activities with perplexity and mutism. Frequent behaviors as if experiencing visual alucinations and repeated allusions to feeling as if in a dream. These symptoms lasted for 2-3 weeks, after treatment with risperidone and lithium. A narrative review concerning the case was also performed. Results Kleist’s ‘innate instability’ permeates much of the previous literature. Similar entities highlight different issues closely related to various biological rhythms: atypical psychosis and epilepsy, puerperal psychosis and estrogen dysregulation, cyclic psychosis and sleep disorders, delirious mania and effectiveness of electro-convulsive-therapy, etc. Conclusions Our findings point to the clinical relevance of oneiroid cyclic psychosis as innate instability. Further studies on the role of biological rhythms and its repercussions on daily practice are required. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness are the most frequent sleep complaints after traumatic brain injury. Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications. Unfortunately, the treatment of sleep disorders associated with traumatic brain injury may not improve neuropsychological function or sleepiness.

Some disturbances of the circadian system are responsible for clinical syndromes characterized by chrono-fatigue, one of them being the sleep delayed phase insomnia. Circadian sleep disorders, either functional or structural, are characterized not only by disturbances in sleep architecture and/or sleep quality, but also by the inability to fall asleep and stay awake at desired times. Similarly, sleep and fatigue present in those circadian disorders typically exhibit a daily cyclic pattern. Night workers and shift workers do have chronic sleep deprivation and desynchronisation of their circadian system with the entraining environment. Those phenomena are responsible for severe vigilance problems, a decrease in work productivity and deleterious health side effects. Fatigue and sleep problems in circadian disorders can now benefit from treatments based on the programed use of synchronizers of the circadian clock, like chronotherapy, bright light and melatonin, combined with adequate sleep hygiene recommendations.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry to sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. The non REM (NREM) parasomnias include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. In children, NREM parasomnias occur out of stage N3 (first part of the night) but in adults can occur out of stages N1 or N2 during any part of the night. We describe a case of NREM parasomnia with atypical clinical presentation. A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "The definition of insomnia is surprisingly quite difficult. It is not possible to decide whether a person has insomnia just by the length of his sleep time. This is because there is a significant difference in how much sleep each person needs. Insomnia is a state in which the patient' s physical, psychological, and social activities are interfered with by a strong feeling of sleep deficiency upon waking in the morning. Insomnia is a symptom, not a name of a disease. In treatment of insomnia, it is not enough to just make the patient sleep by use of sleeping pills. It is essential to research what lies beneath the insomnia, identify the cause, and remove it.",

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

Sleep may be disturbed by the aging process, age-related medical conditions or psychiatric conditions. There are two common sleep disorders in this population: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and restless legs syndrome. Obesity or anatomic changes with aging affecting the upper airway may cause obstructive sleep apneas, which are associated with the development of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric disorders. Symptoms of restless legs are also prevalent in the elderly, resulting in sleep-onset insomnia or frequent nocturnal awakenings. Since sleep pathology can negatively impact cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric functions, assessment and treatment of the underlying sleep disorders may positively impact a patient's health and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping are all highly prevalent among the elderly, reflecting changes in sleep architecture, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and circadian sleep-wake cycles. Insomnia is sometimes associated with subjective daytime sleepiness, as well as other clinical and socioeconomic consequences. The daytime sleepiness will at times lead to napping. Although napping is viewed as a common age-related occurrence, little is known about its benefits or consequences. Factors reported to be contributors to daytime napping include sleep-maintenance difficulty and sleep fragmentation with consequent daytime sleepiness, nighttime use of long-acting sedating agents, daytime use of sedating medications, and dementia. However, a correlation between sleep disturbance and daytime napping has not been consistently observed. Whether napping is beneficial, neutral, or detrimental is an important issue, in light of conflicting findings regarding the impact of daytime napping on nighttime sleep and recent reports of an association between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, including increased mortality risk. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between napping and insomnia, and between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, and to explore the clinical implications of improving insomnia and reducing daytime napping. Clinical evaluations of hypnotic agents should assess efficacy for both improving insomnia symptoms (particularly sleep-maintenance difficulty, in the case of elderly patients) and reducing daytime sleepiness thatwould lead to inadvertent napping.",

Less effective (or even destructive) treatments have been seized upon, in part because they do not require understanding patients. Understanding them means facing facts about ourselves, our families, and our society that we do not want to know, or, in the case of repressed feelings and experiences, do not want to know again. This reluctance to understand is particularly tragic in the case of the acutely disturbed college student, whose crisis may lead either to reorganization at a higher level of functioning and growth or to a wasted life. The central role of terror in producing symptoms and the genesis and handling of symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations, are briefly discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related hallucination (SRH) is a parasomnia that may be encountered in the form of altered dream mentation in α-synucleinopathies, particularly in the setting of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Visual hallucinations (VH) are complex, well-formed, episodes that represent a core diagnostic criterion for DLB. We report a patient who presented with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), VH, and perceiving the world as if he were in a persistent dream-like state coinciding with new cognitive deficits. Report of case(s) A 74 y/o male presented with a subjective perception of “being in a constant dream-like state” for the past 2 years. He describes “atypical nightmares and hypnopompic visual hallucinations” The Patient describes that objects do not feel real, but appear drawn out as in a cartoon. He feels “disconnected” from the environment and perceives images as “distant, distorted, unreal, but also very colorful, vivid, saturated as a cartoon animation sequence. He no longer feels safe to drive and his wife reveals a failure to appreciate depth leading to an increased frequency of falls. Ophthalmologic exam was unremarkable including normal visual acuity, field testing, and color vision. ESS: 8, Sleep log: subjective total sleep- 7-8 hrs/night. Polysomnography conforms the presence of dream enactment behaviors and REM sleep without atonia meeting the diagnostic criteria for RBD. AHI-3, SaO2: 92%. REM latency: 92 minutes. Conclusion People with DLB experience a spectrum of sleep disorders, especially RBD, but also experience a range of sleep and wake-related complex visual hallucinations. The latter may reflect impairment in sensory integration, particularly during the transformation from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DLB due to alteration in visual sensory processing. Sleep clinicians serve a critical role in the evaluation of SRH, and differentiating these from other mimics, such as VH related to neuropsychiatric conditions. Due to their bizarre and perplexing presentation, visual-spatial processing disorders (VSP) in DLB may be stigmatized, dismissed, or attributed to RBD. Sleep clinicians must therefore include recognizing VSP in any patient presenting with SRH. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "La depresion se caracteriza por la presencia de tristeza, perdida de interes o placer, sentimientos de culpa o falta de autoestima, trastornos del sueno o del apetito, sensacion de cansancio y falta de concentracion, es el resultado de interacciones complejas entre factores sociales, psicologicos y biologicos. Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar. (Alberdi Sadupe, Taboada, & Vazquez , 2006).\r\nEn su forma mas grave, puede conducir al suicidio, si es leve, se puede tratar sin necesidad de tratamiento farmacologico, pero cuando tiene caracter moderado o grave se pueden necesitar farmacos y psicoterapia profesional. (OMS, 2017)\r\nEn un estudio realizado a 500 estudiantes universitarios en Lima-Peru, se encontro que la prevalencia de depresion segun los niveles de complejidad corresponde el 9.7% a depresion leve, el 2.8% a depresion moderada y el 0.05% a una depresion severa. \r\nLa presente investigacion busca determinar la prevalencia de la depresion de los estudiantes universitarios en la ciudad Bucaramanga en el ano 2017; utilizando un instrumento disenado para evaluarla clasificandola: en rango normal, ligeramente deprimido, moderadamente deprimido y severamente deprimido.

In the United States, its prevalence is at least 1 in 1000 making it more common than multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Its symptoms lead to severe lifestyle consequences, with profound impact on the affected persons, their interpersonal relationships, job, school experiences, and family life. Despite this, little has appeared in the nursing literature about the disorder. The most characteristic symptoms include uncontrollable excess daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (bilateral voluntary muscle weakness), sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and disturbed night‐time sleep. Characteristics of normal sleep are reviewed and compared with disturbances seen in narcolepsy. The aetiology, assessment, diagnosis, pharmacologic therapy, non‐pharmacologic therapy and psychosocial issues are discussed along with needed research directions.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BP), also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels (1). Some of the most prominent and characteristic symptoms of BP include dramatic disturbances in sleep:wake or rest:activity cycles, with restlessness in the manic phase and extremely low levels of activity during the depressive phase (“having difficulty getting out of bed”) (2, 3). Also, rest:activity cycles can profoundly change the course of clinical manifestations; pharmacological agents such as lithium and antidepressants, which are commonly used to treat this illness, significantly alter the cycling of affective episodes over the longitudinal course of the disorder (2, 3). In PNAS, Pagani et al. (4) report, to their knowledge, the first large-scale systematic analysis of rest:activity phenotypes in 26 pedigrees segregating for severe BP. This study involved monitoring of actigraphy for two weeks in 136 euthymic (between episodes of mania or depression) BP subjects and 422 of their non-BP relatives. To identify sleep, activity, and circadian rhythm phenotypes with a significant genetic component, the authors estimated heritability. In simple terms, they compared the degree of familial relationships with the level of similarity in 73 phenotypes collected for all family members. In addition to identifying heritable rest:activity traits, this analysis also identified a subset of phenotypes correlated with the disease status. Systematic delineation of heritable disease-associated traits, as illustrated in the Pagani et al. paper (4), will be critical in ongoing efforts to link genomic lesions—such as those identified by next-generation sequencing—to complex psychiatric disorders.",

Frequent (recurrent) typical dreams presented by nonepileptic individuals were studied to clarify the nature of typical dreams and to note the possible presence of electroencephalogram abnormalities as have been found during the all-night sleep of certain temporal lobe epileptics with recurrent dreams. Four individuals were interviewed, their dreams collected, and a total of 11 nights of sleep recorded. Although not apparent from initial interviews, all four individuals had more than one specific typical dream. All typical dreams were painful in feeling tone and intrusive. A typical dream may occur in varied motivational contexts, at times simply in association with a somatic sensation. Three individuals had abnormal wave forms in their all-night electroencephalograms. No sustained or epileptiform abnormalities occurred. The appearance of frequent typical dreams may represent a dissolution of the dream mechanism related, in some instances, to an altered neurophysiological factor.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "title": "Mirtazapine in Primary Insomnia: Case report and Literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or achieving restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunities. This condition often results in significant daytime impairments, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, and irritability. Insomnia can be primary or comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety or depression. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

Pathophysiology of paradoxical insomnia remains largely poorly understood.

      "title": "Practical Consequences of Fatigue-Related Performance Failures",
      "abstract": "THE FACT THAT TIRED PEOPLE DO NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS WELL-RESTED PEOPLE DO IS A TRUISM THAT HAS BEEN LONG CONFIRMED BY CAREFUL EMPIRIC study in the laboratory.1 What is less obvious is the way in which fatigue manifests itself in performance changes. At one extreme, the fatigued subject may be in a microsleep (or, indeed, full sleep), in which case there will be a missed or tardy response. Such effects are often best detected by measuring lapses (unduly slow responses), for example, in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. This was shown nicely in a study of repeated sleep restriction,2 in which the number of lapses increased as the week of restricted sleep progressed. However, even without microsleeps, there can be a general slowing in information-processing speed.3 Others4 have argued that sleep loss results in a loss of cognitive creativity, as indicated by a tendency to use old information processing strategies, even though they are no longer optimal or even practical. Certainly, from all viewpoints, the more extreme (and/or chronic) the sleep loss and the longer and more boring the task, the more likely performance decrements are to occur.5\r\n\r\nIn most real-world situations, the worst consequences of fatigue result not from a response slowing from 200 milliseconds to 750 milliseconds, for example, but from a major cognitive or attention failure—something many in the field refer to as a loss of situational awareness.6,7 This loss manifests itself in the operator no longer responding appropriately, or perhaps even responding completely inappropriately, to the situation. Thus, in hindsight, it is clear to the individual concerned that an error was made or that an important feature of the situation was missed. Sometimes this loss of situational awareness results in a catastrophe such as Three Mile Island or Exxon Valdez8; at other times, the situation is saved by additional levels of safety control, resulting in only a near miss. A recent (4/10/2007) public letter from Mark Rosenker, the chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), to Marion Blakely, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and to the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATC) union gives a useful insight into such real-world examples. The letter discusses one recent catastrophe and four recent near misses in the field of commercial aviation that may have resulted from a loss of situational awareness related to fatigue. It also gives the sleep community a compelling case for continuing their public campaign against chronic sleep loss and in furthering the study of the performance consequences of such loss. The full text of the letter is available on the NTSB public website at http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2007/A07_30_32.pdf.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, NTSB Chairman Rosenker expressed concern about accidents and near misses perhaps attributable to ATC personnel working while fatigued. He noted that the NTSB had long been concerned with the effects of fatigue in persons involved in critical functions and the dangers to safety that arose as a consequence. He also documented the large number of suggestions that the NTSB had made to the FAA over the years with the aim of improving the situation and noted that few of them appeared to have been acted upon. In the beginning of his letter, Chairman Rosenker discussed a recent (8/27/2006) fatal air crash at Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe airplane had been cleared by air traffic control (ATC) for takeoff on runway 22, which is 7,003 feet long and equipped with high-intensity runway lights; however, the crew mistakenly taxied onto runway 26, which is 3,500 feet long and unlighted, and attempted to take off. The airplane ran off the end of runway 26, impacted the airport perimeter fence and trees, and crashed. Of the 47 passengers and 3 crew members on board the airplane, 49 were killed, and one received serious injuries… During its ongoing investigation of this accident, the Safety Board has learned that the air traffic controller who cleared the accident airplane for takeoff had worked a shift from 0630 to 1430 the day before the accident, then returned 9 hours later to work the accident shift from 2330 until the time of the accident at 0607 the next morning. The controller stated that his only sleep in the 24 hours before the accident was a 2-hour nap the previous afternoon between these 2 shifts.\r\n\r\nThe NTSB chairman also gave four examples of near misses from Chicago (3/23/2006), Los Angeles (8/19/2004), Denver (9/25/2001), and Seattle (7/8/2001), all potentially involving fatigued ATCs. In all four cases, a loss of situational awareness may have been to blame. In three cases, the ATC put two planes on a collision course on the same runway; in the fourth, the controller failed to notice that the pilot had selected the wrong runway (which was closed for repair). Here is the Los Angeles example.\r\n\r\nA controller cleared a Boeing 737 passenger airplane to taxi onto and take off from runway 24L at the same time that another passenger airplane, a Boeing 747, had been cleared to land on the same runway and was on a short final approach. The pilots in the landing airplane saw the 737 taxi onto the runway and discontinued their approach about 12 seconds before the impending collision would have occurred, passing approximately 200 feet above the 737 during the go-around. The investigation determined that when the controller began working the local control position, he received a correct position-relief briefing that the 747 was approaching runway 24L. The controller later indicated that he subsequently developed a mistaken belief that the 747 was landing on the adjacent parallel runway 24R. The investigation determined that the controller had worked a shift the previous evening from 1530 until 2330, then went home and slept between 5 and 6 hours before returning to work the incident shift, which began at 0730. The controller described the portion of his shift before the incident as a “hard day” and attributed his error, in part, to fatigue.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may concern shift work and overtime, both of which can have a potentially negative impact on the amount of sleep obtained. It is perhaps no coincidence that all 5 incidents occurred immediately after a short return, i.e., a break of only 9 hours between the end of one shift and the start of another. Short returns have been cited as the major problem with regard to backward (phase advance) rotating shifts.9 Such issues can often be worsened by a shortage of qualified personnel to fill positions and an aging workforce. Many in the FAA undoubtedly care deeply about the ATC fatigue issue, and there has been some FAA research activity in this regard and have been a few attempts at employee education. However, as the NTSB letter notes, “The findings that controllers have minimal recollection of the FAA's previously disseminated fatigue-related information and poor awareness of fatigue-related issues and that they inconsistently apply personal strategies for maximizing restorative sleep suggest that safety could be improved by providing more intensive training to controllers on shift-work and fatigue-related issues.”\r\n\r\nThe examples given in the NTSB letter reinforce the need for the sleep community to continue to study the issue of insufficient sleep leading to a loss of situational awareness, even though such experiments may be difficult to design and execute. The NTSB letter also suggests a useful roadmap by which elected officials, the FAA, their employees, other government agencies and the traveling public can be better educated regarding the negative consequences of fatigue and the various ways in which such negative consequences can be ameliorated or avoided. The sleep community is ideally suited to take an active role in this endeavor by ensuring the development and implementation of scientifically accurate education and outreach tools.",

      "title": "Combining Methods of CBT and Progressive Relaxation for Treating Primary Insomnia: A Case Study",
      "abstract": "Primary insomnia is a mental health problem that is often reported due to the combination of either difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep.It is known that people with primary insomnia experience an increased arousal of physiological, cognitive or emotional process, combined with negative conditioning that is associated with sleep.Progressive relaxation is one of the methods known to be effective in minimizing primary insomnia due to the person's need to release their tension.Frequently, the problem that causes primary insomnia derives from anxiety and muscle tension.Further work on the field is needed to show more the effectiveness of progressive relaxation in primary insomnia, especially in Indonesia, due to the lack of papers showing an intervention effect toward mental health problems.This paper presents a single case study of a graduate student who was diagnosed with primary insomnia.Graduate students are more likely to experience sleep deprivation, due to academic pressures and poor sleeping habits.Primary insomnia was diagnosed in this participant because they met the criteria of primary insomnia, such as frequent complaints of inability to fall asleep, and maintaining sleep for at least one month and an impairment in social and occupational functioning.It was shown during counseling that the participant was experiencing distress mainly caused by family problems.The participant felt burdened about the future due to their family's expectations on several subjects such as career, relationships and academic performance.The participant felt the need to fulfill all of the family's requirements.Another intervention, such as the ABC model from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), was needed due to the participant's negative core belief that made them unable to see their own positive traits.The participant also learned a mantra to cancel out unnecessary negative thoughts that caused sleep disturbance.The intervention was conducted for five sessions over a period of three weeks.The participant reported that before she was introduced to progressive relaxation, she had difficulty maintaining her sleep, she woke up five or six times during her sleep, and she was able to sleep only after midnight.After being taught progressive relaxation, the participant reported that her primary insomnia symptoms had decreased.She was able to sleep without any disturbance and fall sleep at 10 p.m.The participant's anxiety toward her family's expectations also decreased markedly.She reported that she was able to focus on what matters in the present, able to distinguish between her own needs and her family's expectations.Mantras were constantly used by the participant even a year after the intervention.She reported that using a mantra was the most efficient way for her to cancel out negative thoughts.This single case study showed that a short-term intervention was capable of providing an effective outcome for an individual with primary insomnia.It was also shown that progressive relaxation was successful in treating primary insomnia.This single case study showed the need to reduce anxiety for people with poor quality of sleep.It is suggested for further study to replicate progressive relaxation for reducing primary insomnia symptoms due to the successful outcome of this single case study.",

An estimated 1.8 million Americans are current nonmedical users of sedatives. Many sedatives act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, producing depressed cortical function and disinhibition. Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, vasomotor collapse, and even death. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications. Patients can be withdrawn with a taper of a long-acting benzodiazepine or phenobarbital; inpatient treatment may be required for severe use disorder or withdrawal.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances-particularly insomnia - are highly prevalent in anxiety disorders and complaints such as insomnia or nightmares have even been incorporated in some anxiety disorder definitions, such as generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

Patients with acute or chronic pain often complain of difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, shorter sleep duration, unrefreshing sleep, and poor sleep quality in general. According to the majority of the experimental human studies, sleep deprivation may produce hyperalgesic changes. The selective disruption of slow wave sleep has shown this effect more consistently, while results after selective REM sleep deprivation remain unclear. Patients with chronic pain have a marked alteration of sleep structure and continuity, such as frequent sleep-stage shifts, increased nocturnal awakenings, decreased slow wave sleep (SWS), decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and alpha-delta sleep. Many analgesic medications can alter sleep architecture in a manner similar to the effects of acute and chronic pain, suppressing SWS and REM sleep.",

Hoarding refers to the excessive acquisition of relatively worthless items, which eventually results in the compromise of living space and/or the daily activities of affected individuals. As a symptom, hoarding is relatively common in a significant minority of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the context of obsessive-compulsive disorder, symptoms typically emerge in the teens through the early 20s. However, hoarding also appears to exist as a distinct syndrome, which is characterized by late onset, childhood adversity, various Axis II traits, and a history of alcohol misuse. While the explicit position of hoarding in the psychiatric nomenclature remains undetermined, this behavior is likely to surface in both psychiatric and primary care settings.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "title": "Reconsidering sleep perception in insomnia: from misperception to mismeasurement",
      "abstract": "Summary So‐called ‘sleep misperception’ refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective–objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture ‘wake‐like’ brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro‐ and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non‐rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought‐like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.",

Older adults have increased prevalence of various primary sleep disorders, including restless leg syndrome, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, circadian rhythm disturbances and periodic limb syndrome. Challenges in identifying, diagnosing, and treating sleep disorders in older adults with dementia also exist, which further complicates the management of sleep disorders in these patients.

Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized as those who cannot sleep, those who will not sleep, those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and those with increased movements during sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in daytime impairment, is diagnosed using history findings and treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without sleep hypnotics. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs that worsens with rest, is relieved by movement, and often occurs in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome is treated based on the frequency of symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is diagnosed using a sleep log or actigraphy, followed by overnight polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, such as modafinil; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate). Patients with snoring and witnessed apneas may have obstructive sleep apnea, which is diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in the patient acting out dreams with possible harmful consequences. It is diagnosed based on history and polysomnography findings, and treated with environmental safety measures and melatonin or clonazepam.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "SLEEP APNOEA: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND TREATMENT",
      "abstract": "An awakening has taken place over the last 25 years to the science of sleep disorders. Foremost amongst these, both in the medical world and the public eye, has been Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (SAS). The prevalence is thought to be the order of 1-2%. Males are eight times more commonly affected than females, although after the menopause the gap narrows considerably. Sleep apnoea occurs in children, usually in relation to large tonsils and adenoids, but in adult life patients usually present between the age of 40 and 60 and the prevalence increases with age. Numerous apnoeas or hypopnoeas during the night's sleep result in disordered sleep architecture and unrefreshing sleep. This is usually accompanied by night-long snoring which may lead to marital discord and even complaints from neighbours. Symptoms on waking may be a headache and a feeling of not being refreshed by sleep. Sleepiness during the day can interfere with work and social activities and may produce risks to the patient and others if it occurs while operating dangerous machinery or driving. Over a longer time scale SAS results in intellectual and memory deterioration, a higher incidence of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, polycythemia and pulmonary hypertension. Right heart failure is particularly likely if there is chronic airflow obstruction contributing to a low arterial oxygen level. Asystolic periods and tachyarrhythmias may occur during apnoeic periods. The increased mortality of SAS relates to coronary and cerebrovascular disease and arrhythmias. Sudden death occurs with greater frequency in patients with SAS, mainly at night.",

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain. Treatment takes into account the aforementioned risk factors, plus interventions appropriate to the malfunctioning system.",

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of sleeprelated upper airway obstructions, which usually are associated with oxygen desaturation. A special situation of abnormal sleep disorders in the elderly is degenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), and prion diseases all pose different challenges and disruptions to sleep.

These episodes of hypoxia or apnea can lead to tissue inflammation, and are causal factors of disturbed sleep in both men and women. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep. Compared to men, women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as pregnancy. It is therefore not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during menopause, too. Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.",

However, the most common symptom of schizophrenia is disability in everyday functioning: impairments in social, living, and vocational outcomes. The striking clinical signs of schizophrenia are episodic in nature and can come and go even in the absence of treatment, as demonstrated by the fact that up to a third of people with schizophrenia demonstrated remission of these symptoms even prior to the development of antipsychotic medications. In contrast, disability in schizophrenia develops early in the illness and is persistent, even during periods when the symptoms just described are absent because of treatment or spontaneous remission.",

      "title": "Hallucinations related to artificial ventilation in the prone position",
      "abstract": "We read with interest the recent correspondence (Hudsmith & Navapurkar. Anaesthesia 2001; 56: 1124) regarding the case of the critically ill patient who reported nocturnal hallucinations and nightmares about ‘not waking up’ and delusional memories of his time spent on Intensive Care, being nursed in the␣prone position. Hallucinations, nightmares and distressing memories are symptoms of re-experiencing. Re-experiencing is one of a cluster of three symptoms, often associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD and other psychological difficulties have been extensively documented in survivors of critical illness and Intensive Care admission [1, 2]. In fact, the incidence of PTSD after Intensive Care treatment has been found to be as high as 38% [3, 4]. This problem has been widely recognised, and yet PTSD frequently remains undiagnosed and subsequently not treated, despite the publication of consistent evidence. Certain factors have been found to affect a person's response to a traumatic event, including the amount of stress in the person's life at the time of the trauma [5]. We wonder whether in this case, the patient has developed PTSD to his ICU experience, possibly predisposed to by his pre-operative anxieties, as evidenced by his repeated refusal to allow the surgical team to insert a nasogastric tube. Interestingly, the suggestion of inadequate sedation in this patient, despite appropriate sedation scores, may well be questionable in light of recent evidence that suggests that PTSD may be related to the recall of delusions alone, and that even unpleasant memories for real events may give some protection from anxiety and the later development of PTSD-related symptoms [6]. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) can be diagnosed as early as 2 days post-trauma. The criterion for ASD is closely modelled on PTSD, but with an additional symptom of ‘dissociation’. This includes symptoms of numbing, reduced awareness, depersonalisation, derealisation and amnesia [7]. ASD is strongly predictive of the later development of PTSD [8, 9], and systems should be developed to diagnose it as brief early interventions have been shown to prevent PTSD [10]. If an individual does display significant symptomatology following a traumatic event, particularly if this continues, it would seem appropriate to offer more formal treatment at an early stage [11], since longer term PTSD is often associated with comorbid disorders that interfere with therapeutic success [12]. The ICU outpatient clinic therefore, may well be too late for some of these patients, since PTSD is diagnosed 4 weeks after the traumatic event and becomes chronic at 3 months. Addressing symptoms during the acute phase of the trauma response may prevent the more complicated forms of post-traumatic adjustment. We need to follow up sooner, rather than later. We would therefore welcome further expansion of the role of outreach teams to identify and direct the necessary psychological care of those patients who have recently left the critical care environment. Current research at the University Hospital of Wales has identified a high incidence of ASD in survivors of Critical Care between 4 and 7 days postdischarge from the Intensive Care Unit. This prompted the investigation and application of a more pro-active and eclectic counselling approach, which is resulting in a clinically significant and meaningful reduction in PTSD, anxiety and depression in patients after treatment on Intensive Care.",

      "title": "When and How to Investigate the Patient with Headache",
      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

The typical course of a psychogenic epidemic at a workplace progresses from sudden onset, often with dramatic symptoms, to a rapidly attained peak that draws much publicity and is followed by quick disappearance of the symptoms. Over 90% of the affected persons are women, and the symptoms range from dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and fainting to epileptic-type seizures, hyperventilation, and skin disorders. The background mechanisms are thought to be generalized beliefs and triggering events which create a sense of threat that leads to a physiological state of arousal. This state, in turn, creates new beliefs which give meaning to the sense of arousal. The new belief spreads through sociometric channels. Predisposing factors include boredom, pressure to produce, physical stressors, poor labor-management relations, and impaired interpersonal communications, and lack of social support. It is important that a thorough investigation be carried out in all instances. Investigation is not only necessary for diagnosis, but it also reassures the management, the employees, and the press that physical factors are unlikely to be responsible for the disease.",

      "title": "Insomnia associated with medical disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

      "title": "Violence in sleep",
      "abstract": "Although generally considered as mutually exclusive, violence and sleep can coexist. Violence related to the sleep period is probably more frequent than generally assumed and can be observed in various conditions including parasomnias (such as arousal disorders and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder), epilepsy (in particular nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy) and psychiatric diseases (including delirium and dissociative states). Important advances in the fields of genetics, neuroimaging and behavioural neurology have expanded the understanding of the mechanisms underlying violence and its particular relation to sleep. The present review outlines the different sleep disorders associated with violence and aims at providing information on diagnosis, therapy and forensic issues. It also discusses current pathophysiological models, establishing a link between sleep-related violence and violence observed in other settings.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for human survival since it helps to restore and maintain our bodies' immune systems and other essential processes. One-third of a person's life is devoted to sleeping, although few are aware of the many positive aspects of this activity. Two distinct types of sleep, REM and NREM, have been identified. A good night's rest is achieved when REM and NREM sleep alternate in a regular pattern. Disruptions to this cycle, whether they originate physiologically or psychologically, have been linked to a variety of health problems. Polysomnography (PSG) equipment is often used in sleep labs inside hospitals to perform sleep studies. A polysomnogram is an in-depth medical technique that records a patient's vital signs while they sleep and necessitates a hospital stay. Clinically, sleep apnea is defined as a breathing disease in which there are periodic pauses in breathing lasting 10 seconds or more that occur more than five times during the night. Sleep apnea may be classified as either Obstructive, Central, or Mixed. The prevalent sleep problem known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by the relaxation of muscles in the upper airway during sleep. The purpose of this study is to provide a technique for screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea by analysing Heart Rate Variability of Electrocardiogram (ECG) data while the subject is asleep. The goals of this study are to create computational approaches for identifying OSA based on characteristics extracted from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals derived from sleep electrocardiograms (ECGs). Physio Net's Apnea-ECG recordings serve as the source for the ECG data.",

Sleep problems occur frequently in the general population, and are even more common in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI patients have restless sleep, complain of spasms, difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, snoring, often awaking in the early hours of the morning and are unable to fall asleep again, and during the day time they are tired and sleepy. Patients with SCI often say they sleep less or don?t feel rested when they wake up. Studies have been reported that sleep disturbances have potential negative impact and sleep disorders can hinder the rehabilitation process and affect global outcomes in patients with spinal cord injury. It is important to assess the presence of sleep problems in SCI patients, and to provide effective treatments when indicated for their compliance of rehabilitation program and increasing quality of life.",

Moreover, they appear at nearly all levels of morphological organisation, ranging from the intracellular space to tissue and organs. One important feature of rhythmic behaviour is its ability to respond in a characteristic manner to different external requirements.

      "title": "Paediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem, affecting approximately one-third of the children in the general population. Despite its high prevalence, paediatric insomnia is often unrecognized and untreated in clinical practice. It is commonly associated with other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric comorbidities, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). If left untreated, paediatric insomnia may be linked to a constellation of negative impacts in the affected child, including an increased risk of health-related problems (e.g., obesity/overweight, pain, fatigue), psychological issues (e.g., anxiety, depression), interpersonal problems (e.g., poor family relationships, peer problems) and impaired daytime functioning (e.g., poor alertness, impaired school performance), as well as elevated levels of family stress and impaired parental mental health and quality of life. Several factors may contribute to paediatric insomnia, including genetic influence, hyperarousal and hypersensitivity, circadian issues, poor sleep hygiene, comorbid medical conditions, and psychosocial and behavioural factors. A thorough assessment is essential to inform the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents. Actigraphy can provide a continuous and objective estimation of sleep-wake patterns, and is a useful tool in the assessment of paediatric insomnia. Behavioural interventions are usually recommended as the first-line treatment and there has been limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of medications for treating paediatric insomnia. The current chapter provides an overview of paediatric insomnia, including the classification and diagnostic criteria, prevalence, consequences, and factors associated with childhood insomnia, as well as its assessment and management.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWD) are sleep dysfunctions related to circadian functioning. They are characterized by symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occur because the intrinsic circadian pacemaker is not entrained to a 24-h light/dark cycle. Affected individuals with a free-running disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome (N24SWD) have a longer sleep–wake cycle that produces a sleep pattern that typically delays each day. The disorder is seen in 70% of blind people, and among people with healthy vision, it is a rare pathology. Among sighted cases, 80% are young men and 28% have a psychiatric disorder. The patient was a 14-year-old boy with a psychiatric pathology diagnosed with a PANDAS syndrome (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci), a sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood lability accompanied by obsessive compulsive-like issues and/or tics, in association with a streptococcal A infection that occurs immediately prior to the symptoms. As a comorbidity, he exhibited severe insomnia due to an irregular sleep pattern that strongly delayed his sleep schedule day to day. It affected his daily routines, as he was not going to school, and aggravated, furthermore, the psychiatric symptoms. He was referred for sleep consultation, where the case was explored by ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) using the novel system Kronowise ® (Chronolab, University of Murcia) and diagnosed with a non-24-h sleep–wake disorder (N24SWD). The first treatment approach for the patient was focused on improving symptoms during the acute infection and psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, sleep pathology was treated by light therapy and melatonin. After 8 months and different trials, it was possible to establish a treatment to normalize the symptoms and fix his sleep rhythm in a normal schedule as well as to reduce anxious symptoms during the day. The association of PANDAS and N24SWD has not previously been reported in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have reached epidemic rates in the modern world. It is important to note that they can affect children as well as adults. Sleep is of the utmost importance for the maintenance of body homeostasis. Many disease processes affecting sleep have been associated with numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, fatigue as well as a wide range of behavioral, hormonal and metabolic derangements. Sleep disorders in childhood can be classified by age of incidence (in infants, toddlers, school-age children or adolescents) and by the exact nature of the symptoms. They are classified in insomnias, hypersomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm disorders and respiratory disorders which affect sleep. Parasomnias are the most common sleep disorders in toddlers, with night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking being the most common. Respiratory disorders are the most important in older children, especially obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. All sleep disorders are clinically manifested with symptoms of sleep deprivation. Their management always involves improvement of sleep hygiene, though in some cases (such as obstructive sleep apnea) specific medical treatment is also available and warranted. A three-way relationship of trust, compassion and cooperation between child, family and healthcare professional is a prerequisite for the effective management of childhood sleep disorders. Nursing staff are the main factor cultivating that relationship in the context of inpatient care.",

Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

We know that some patients will subject themselves to constant suffering and discomfort, or will practise the most patient and painful imposture, for no conceivable object save to be exceptional or to attract attention; and there is no want of charity in suspecting that in some cases the somnambulism was but hysterical simulation or morbid malingering.",

Flashbacks are typical symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and their main features are intrusive and vivid images that occur in a waking state. We present a case study of a man diagnosed with social anxiety disorder who had reexperiencing symptoms similar to flashbacks of what he considered \"shameful situations\". The differential aspects between flashbacks and obsessional imagery are discussed. Reexperiencing symptoms and imagery of social phobia as well as the sociocultural influence over the symptomatology of psychiatric disorders are then highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood. Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are present during all stages of the condition and exert a negative impact on overall course, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. We examine the partnership between circadian system (process C) functioning and sleep–wake homeostasis (process S) on optimal sleep functioning and explore the role of disruptions in both systems on sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that sleep problems in bipolar disorder result from dysregulation across both process C and process S systems. Biomarkers of depressive episodes include heightened fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and a greater percentage of awakenings, while biomarkers of manic episodes include reduced REM latency, greater percentage of stage I sleep, increased REM density, discontinuous sleep patterns, shortened total sleep time, and a greater time awake in bed. These findings highlight the importance of targeting novel treatments for sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder. Keywords: bipolar disorder, circadian rhythms, sleep–wake homeostasis",

The clinician's first task is to separate sleep problems originating in the physiologic changes of aging from those originating in pathological processes. Normal elderly persons have greater difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, compared with younger persons, and sleep is qualitatively more shallow with more involuntary movements and abnormal breathing. Sleep complaints reach a pathological level as elders begin to experience deterioration of function during their period of normal wakefulness, manifested as excessive sleepiness, concentration deficits, and mood changes, or the emergence of bizarre or dangerous behavior during sleep. Sleep disorders are associated with excess physical and psychiatric morbidity and are treatable. An approach focused on sleep-related syndromes is a useful basis for rational treatment, and the treatment of many sleep disorders can be provided without expensive sleep laboratory testing.",

Sometimes, the most important problems following concussion are not immediately apparent to the patient.

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages.

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa. The impact of early childhood events in particular may have the long-lasting effects,especially if epigenetic changes are involved.",

In my experience, prolonged loss of consciousness lasting for several hours that is neither EDS nor ordinary sleep attacks can occur in PD patients and indeed seems to be a symptom unique to PD.<bold>Case presentation:</bold> Eight patients with PD are reported who showed episodes of loss of consciousness lasting for 4-24 h that appeared to be deep sleep or a coma, and could not be roused even by strong painful stimuli. After four hours or more, they spontaneously resumed consciousness without sequelae.<bold>Discussion and conclusions: </bold>According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders - Third edition (ICSD-3), “hypersomnia due to a medical disorder,” a synonym of EDS, and “narcolepsy, type 2”, a synonym of sleep attacks are the representatives of sleep disorder in PD. However, the diagnostic criteria of these two disorders in ICSD-3 differ from the prolonged loss of consciousness in my cases. As it has brought great concern to family members, medical staff, and emergent hospital personnel, we must pay more attention to this type of loss of consciousness.",

Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Nightmares are intense and unpleasant dream experiences that characterize approximately 4 percent of the adult population at least on a weekly basis. Nightmare frequency is often co-morbid with other mental complaints; however, recent results indicate that nightmare disorder is independent from waking mental dysfunctions. Nightmare disorder is intimately related to poor subjective sleep quality, and according to polysomnographic studies nightmare subjects’ sleep is characterized by increased sleep fragmentation and hyper-arousal. These findings suggest that instead of the psychopathological perspective nightmare disorder should be viewed as a specific sleep disorder that requires targeted treatment. Nevertheless, in order to choose the adequate treatment procedure clinicians should examine the co-morbid mental disorders as well taking into consideration the severity of nightmare distress, the latter supposed to be the mediator between nightmare frequency and waking mental dysfunctions.

      "abstract": "Schedule-dependent sleep problems tend to increase as the youngster moves from middle childhood through preadolescence and into adolescence. This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Stroke: Pathophysiological Links, Clinical Implications, and Management Strategies",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and stroke are intricately linked through a complex, bidirectional relationship. Sleep disturbances such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) not only increase the risk of stroke but also frequently emerge as consequences of cerebrovascular events. OSA, in particular, is associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of incident stroke, primarily through mechanisms involving intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation. Conversely, stroke can disrupt sleep architecture and trigger or exacerbate sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances, and breathing-related sleep disorders. These post-stroke sleep disturbances are common and significantly impair rehabilitation, cognitive recovery, and quality of life, yet they remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Early identification and management of sleep disorders in stroke patients are essential to optimize recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. Therapeutic strategies include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, medical devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and emerging alternatives for CPAP-intolerant individuals. Despite growing awareness, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding non-OSA sleep disorders and their impact on stroke outcomes. Improved diagnostic tools, broader screening protocols, and greater integration of sleep assessments into stroke care are urgently needed. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay between sleep and stroke, emphasizing the importance of personalized, multidisciplinary approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Advancing research in this field holds promise for reducing the global burden of stroke and improving long-term outcomes through targeted sleep interventions.",

The epidemiological evidence is reviewed, the diagnostic criteria most frequently used in clinical practice are examined, and a series of therapeutic recommendations for the correct treatment of this pathology is presented. Sleep disorders are very prevalent in the general population (one-third experiences difficulty with sleep initiation/maintenance at least once a week, and about 6-15% meet the criteria for insomnia disorders), but remain relatively poorly understood and frequently overlooked by healthcare professionals. Prevalence estimates of insomnia disorder vary between 5% and 20%. Sleep disorders co-exist with psychiatric and medical conditions with an interactive and bidirectional relationship. About 70-80% of psychiatric patients show some sleep disturbance and there is a correlation between the severity of the sleep disturbance and the severity of the psychopathology. Untreated sleep disorders increase the risk of cardiovascular events, cognitive impairment, motor vehicle accidents, obesity, diabetes, and efficiency and safety at work, leading to increased all-cause healthcare utilization and being a strong predictor of sick leave or disability pension and poor quality of life. Sleep disorders can cause drowsiness or excessive daytime sleepiness, which can lead to functional impairment in 15% of the general adult population. Sleep quality should be a routine target in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric and non-psychiatric diseases to ensure sleep health based on early diagnosis and adequate therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

      "abstract": "The state of sleep consists of different phases that proceed in successive, tightly regulated order through the night forming a physiological program, which for each individual is different but stabile from one night to another. Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

SW, CA and ST are different clinical manifestations of the same disorder being ST the most severe and SW the mildest manifestation. Disorders of arousal are typical parasomnias of NREM sleep, mainly slow wave sleep. Pathophysiological mechanism of these disorders is the state's dissociation of wakefulness and sleep. The conjunction of the constitutional factors (genetic, age, sleep privation, drugs, psychological, etc.), and precipitant factors (light, sound, temperature, touch, apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, fever, psychological, etc.) permit three possible arousal behavioral response: A full awakening, a shift stage of sleep or a partial arousal. Clinical significance of arousal parasomnias depend on the age. In children are caused by developmental and genetic factors and usually are autolimited. In adults usually are caused by psychopathology. In the elderly are often caused by organic brain syndromes. Parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are: Rhythmic movements of sleep, sleeptalking, starts and the nocturnal cramp. Most of them are mild disorders, almost physiological phenomena that usually don't need any treatment.",

S disturbances have been shown to increase risk and/or exacerbate psychiatric and physical health problems in many different populations. However, few studies have examined the relationships among sleep, psychiatric, and cognitive functioning in Veterans with TBI.\r\nMethods: Retrospective chart reviews of 137 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI referred for cognitive rehabilitation at the Veteran Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.\r\nResults: 100% of Veterans reported clinically significant sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory [PSQI] global scores >5). Veterans also reported clinically relevant impairments in sleep latency (50 minutes), total sleep time (5.5 hours), and sleep efficiency (77%). More severe sleep problems were related to greater endorsement of depressive, post-concussive, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Conversely, sleep disturbance showed limited associations with objective neuropsychological assessment. Overall measures of affective functioning were significantly associated with global measures of sleep quality, though such relationships were not observed for quantitative measures of sleep.\r\nConclusions: Veterans with mild to moderate TBI exhibit very high rates of sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance is associated with higher levels of comorbid psychiatric symptomatology, particularly affective complaints. The high prevalence of sleep problems in Veterans with a history of TBI underscores a need to develop both a better understanding of etiologic mechanisms relating brain injury and sleep and a better clinical appreciation of the ramifications of sleep disturbance on daily functioning and recovery in individuals who experience TBI.",

Consistent performance decrement is difficult to find, but marked increase in fatigue is a common problem. Sleep loss, both total and partial, tends to potentiate the circadian influence on performance and interact with other stressors to enhance the stress-induced physiological responses.

Its wide presence in the phylogenetic vertebrate scale and even in human fetuses as young as 12 weeks directed the search for the common anatomic and biochemical mechanisms involved. The demonstration that yawning is not connected with high CO2 or low O2 blood levels left aside a prevalent metabolic hypothesis. Its close relationship with the sleep-wake cycle, specially in moments previous to falling asleep and after awaking has been related to changes in personal situation and activity. A single component of this reflex which is to be found exclusively in humans, is the fact that yawning is contagious. Thus, it is considered a component of the adaptative mechanism that is part of the surveillance reflex, becoming a significant paralinguistic evolutive expression aimed at protection and social cohesion. The common anatomical structures and neurochemical systems taking part in yawning, the sleep-wake cycle and the temporal lobe epilepsy may imply that yawning results from a set of protective systems induced by endogenous opiods which intervene in the inhibition and prevention of the temporal lobe epileptic seizures.",

Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

      "abstract": "Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an umbrella term for several chronic conditions in which partial or complete cessation of breathing occurs many times throughout the; one SDB condition in particular, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), has been globally recognized as a growing public health issue. OSAS is a chronic disease involving repetitive pauses in breathing during sleep that can cause numerous health issues if left untreated such as increased risk for hypertension, coronary heart disease, type-2 diabetes, stroke and depression. Daytime sleepiness, which can occur secondary to OSAS, impacts one’s ability to operate a motor vehicle properly and is likened to driving under the influence of alcohol. Early screening has the potential to identify OSAS and initiate subsequent treatment, which can improve breathing during sleep and decrease daytime sleepiness. The significance of early detection cannot be overlooked, as the far-reaching effects of OSAS have large public health implications.",

Although most acute episodes of LBP are self-limiting, recurrent pain occurs in about 50–75% of individuals within 1 year. For the majority of patients, LBP is a chronic-recurrent problem and thus initial treatment recommendations should focus on long-term active approaches to health and well-being. Psychosocial and affective factors are the best predictors of an episode of acute LBP transitioning to a chronic pain state. These include depression, anxiety, trauma, social marginalization, passive coping, and fear. Exercise is generally the best supported treatment for LBP, although there are no real data to suggest that any one particular approach is uniquely beneficial. Excessive rest, unnecessary imaging, negative language, inaccurate and unhelpful diagnoses, excessive activity restrictions, and reliance on generally unhelpful or overtly harmful medications lead to iatrogenic disability and worse outcomes.",

Third, the extant literature is summarized regarding short or long sleep duration and/or insufficient sleep, insomnia and insomnia symptoms, general (non-specific sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm abnormalities that result in sleep disturbances, and, briefly, sleep-disordered breathing. Fourth, the review highlights the social/behavioural context of sleep, including discussions of sleep and race/ethnicity, socio-economic position, and other social/environmental factors, in order to place these findings in a social-environmental context relevant to public health. Fifth, the review highlights the issue of sleep as a domain of health behaviour and addresses issues regarding development of healthy sleep interventions.

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations of diurnal variation of mood and early morning awakening in depression have been incorporated into established diagnostic systems, as has the seasonal modifier defining winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, SAD). Many circadian rhythms measured in depressive patients are abnormal: earlier in timing, diminished in amplitude, or of greater variability. Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

      "title": "Developing an International Core Outcome Set for SSD Interventions",
      "abstract": "Unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) is defined as normal or near-normal hearing in one ear and a severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment in the other ear.1 Common causes of SSD in adulthood include vestibular schwannoma and associated surgery, Ménière's disease, and bacterial or viral infections. SSD affects an estimated 12 to 27 individuals in every 100,000 of the general population.2Shutterstock/Inspiring, hearing loss, deafness, technology.Figure 1: Steps to develop a core outcome set for SSD interventions for adults. Hearing loss, deafness, technology.Difficulties in daily life as a result of SSD vary considerably from person to person. Functional difficulties in everyday life are commonly reported, such as difficulties in speech perception in noisy environments and poor spatial awareness. SSD can also negatively affect one's psychological well-being, resulting in worries about losing one's hearing in the other ear and/or reduced confidence and belief in one's abilities to participate in social situations. Various social impacts of SSD can result from activity limitations and participation restrictions, including withdrawal from and within situations.3 The multidimensional burden of SSD on an individual's overall health is indicated by reductions in health-related quality of life.4 Interventions like a contralateral routing of signals (CROS) aid or a bone conduction device aim to alleviate the impact of SSD by rerouting signals from the impaired ear to the better-hearing ear.5 In the past decade, we have seen the introduction of cochlear implantation,6 which restores hearing by delivering information directly to the impaired side, thus creating a sensation of true binaural hearing. TREATMENT CHALLENGES The challenge faced by people diagnosed with SSD, health care professionals, and clinical researchers is understanding which intervention (if any) is ideal.7 How can we measure the benefits or harms associated with an intervention for SSD? Existing literature has highlighted inconsistencies in the benefits and risks (side effects), or outcome domains, assessed when evaluating these interventions. For example, clinical studies that evaluate these interventions have measured performances such as speech perception in quiet or noisy environments and sound localization. Studies have also assessed tinnitus symptom severity and quality of life. The tests (measurement instruments) that researchers have chosen to measure these effects also vary widely from study to study. For example, sound localization can be measured using a setup of four loudspeakers arranged at the front, back, and sides (90 degrees apart) or a more complex setup of six loudspeakers arranged in a semi-circle in front of the participant (30 degrees apart). This diversity of chosen measures poses a challenge to both health care users and professionals when comparing and contrasting various study outcomes. In some cases, researchers choose available measures because they are standardized or easily accessible, and not because of their importance to health care users or professionals themselves. ADDRESSING THE INCONSISTENCY Identifying appropriate outcome domains is crucial to designing clinical trials to evaluate the effects of various interventions for SSD.8 Selected outcomes need to be vital and tailored to key stakeholders such as health care users, professionals, or budget holders to minimize bias when making decisions about health care.9 Furthermore, the choice of outcome measures should be based on what is important and of interest to people making decisions about health care, not on what outcome instruments are available or most commonly used. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative just celebrated its 10th anniversary. The network brings together researchers interested in the development of agreed and standardized sets of outcomes, known as core outcome sets. Part of the COMET work focuses on developing recommendations on minimum standards for the design of core outcome set (COS) studies.10 A COS is a recommendation of what should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific area as a minimum. If developed from the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, a COS can overcome the problems imposed by the utilization of diverse measures. In the field of audiology and ENT, a group led by Professor Deborah A. Hall at the University of Nottingham has developed a COS for tinnitus.11 Professor Iain A. Bruce and his team at the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre are working on the PONCHO study: Prioritizing Outcomes iN Childhood Hearing lOss. THE CROSSSD STUDY The Core Rehabilitation Outcome Set for Single-Sided Deafness (CROSSSD) project is an international initiative that aims to develop a COS for SSD interventions. It aims to find an agreement on what outcomes are critical and should always be measured when evaluating interventions for SSD, using the methodology proposed by the COMET initiative. We have an advisory group of clinical professionals from the United Kingdom, United States, and Europe. The CROSSSD project also works closely with people who have lived experience of SSD. They have been integral to the design and delivery of the CROSSSD study. For example, a promotional video (http://bit.ly/2QbLJk) was developed alongside collaborators with lived experience of SSD to increase awareness of the project and help with global participant recruitment. Our methodology is as follows (Fig. 1): Systematic review of the published literature reporting interventions for SSD to identify the outcome domains and measurement instruments that have already been used.12 Workshops using a range of qualitative methods to explore patient perspectives on outcomes. Interactive online consensus exercise, known as a Delphi survey, with key stakeholders to identify which outcome domains are important when evaluating SSD interventions. Interactive consensus meeting with a subgroup of the key stakeholders to discuss the Delphi survey findings and recommend a minimum set of outcome domains that are relevant to all. So far, we have completed the systematic review of the literature. From 72 papers, we identified a total of 244 outcome domains. Many of these were duplicates or not directly relevant to SSD, and so we were able to produce a shortened list of 44 unique candidate outcome domains. The Delphi survey engaged 277 participants from 30 countries. They suggested five additional candidate outcome domains. The e-Delphi concluded in February 2020 and the CROSSSD team are currently preparing for the interactive consensus meeting to finalize the core outcome domain set. FUTURE STEPS Once a COS is developed, we would know what is important to measure in all studies; however researchers also need to consider how the included outcomes should be measured. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) international initiative has collaborated with the COMET initiative to develop guidelines for selecting outcome measurement instruments for outcomes included in a COS.13 For instance, if quality of life is an outcome in a COS, indicated to be critical and important to always measure for SSD interventions, COSMIN standards can help us establish what commonly agreed instrument or questionnaire everyone should utilize to measure it. Appropriate dis emination strategies14 will ensure that anyone designing a trial in this area will have a list of outcomes to measure as a minimum, alongside a list of recommended instruments to utilize. The COS will not prevent researchers from measuring additional outcomes or utilizing supplementary instruments. Future studies in the field should adopt the recommended COS to reduce the heterogeneity of measures utilized. Moreover, only outcomes meaningful to all stakeholders will be employed and, as a result, transparency will be established since both benefits and harms will be reported. Clinical researchers will be supported in thinking critically about what they are trying to measure, and they will not select their outcomes simply based on the popularity or accessibility of available instruments. Uptake of the COS will be encouraged internationally to improve research quality, enhance clinical decision-making, and facilitate meta-analysis in systematic reviews.

      "title": "Neglect",
      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "title": "Sleep and home parenteral nutrition in adults: A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Infusions of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are often cycled at night coinciding with sleep episodes. Adult consumers of HPN are known to experience poor sleep attributed to frequent awakenings and long durations of wakefulness after falling asleep. Consequently, most consumers do not meet recommendations for sleep duration and quality or daytime napping. The primary underlying pathophysiology resulting in sleep problems is nocturia; however, other factors also exist, including disruptions caused by medical equipment (ie, pump alarms), comorbid conditions, dysglycemia, and medication use. Early guidance on sleep is imperative because of the central role of sleep in physical health and wellbeing, including mitigating complications, such as infection risk, gastrointestinal problems, pain sensitivity, and fatigue. Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population. Addressing comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders, and nutrition deficiencies may also help. Pharmacologic interventions and technological advancement in HPN delivery are also needed. Research on sleep in this population is considered a priority, yet it remains limited at this time.",

      "title": "A guide to pharmacologic management of target symptoms of severe tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Patients who report severe tinnitus often describe a highly distressing experience leading to significant irritation, annoyance, insomnia, and difficulty coping. This can be highly intrusive and interfere with the ability to work, play, and enjoy life. When sufficiently severe, the distress may go beyond what the individual can tolerate and lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed. Medication is necessary when patients exhaust their emotional and physical reserves in coping with a noxious sensation. Distressing symptoms of tinnitus include the perceived loudness itself, as well as insomnia, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, agitation, obsessive thinking about the tinnitus, worry about job performance, despair, depression, fear of sound, and hyperacusis.1,2 For each of the problem target symptoms, a thorough evaluation is needed. Where these symptoms go beyond the tinnitus management counseling, referral to primary care is warranted. Insomnia is a common complaint with severe tinnitus and is associated with the risk of anxiety and depression.3–4 Understanding the nature and duration of the insomnia, etiology of awakenings, and degree of daytime function allows the primary-care clinician to design appropriate behavioral and pharmacologic interventions.5 Non-pharmacologic interventions for insomnia are preferred and should be attempted first. Good sleep hygiene involves keeping the same sleep/wake time and avoiding daytime naps and stimulating television or reading before bedtime. In addition, patients should limit caffeine intake for 8 hours before bedtime, limit alcohol intake for 4 hours before bedtime, and limit exercise for 3 hours before bedtime. ANTI-INSOMNIA MEDICATIONS The choice of medication for insomnia depends on the type of insomnia and etiology. Paradoxically, some of the very medications associated with causing tinnitus may also help lessen it in some individuals. Classes of medication associated with tinnitus include analgesics, antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, cardiac, vascular, gastrointestinal, hypnotics, and antidepressants.6–7 In choosing a medication for a patient, the primary-care clinician should do a thorough medication history and take other systemic conditions and medication interaction effects into account. Anti-insomnia agents include barbiturates, benzodiazepines (BDZ), non-benzodiazepines (NBDZ), and sedating antidepressants. Barbiturates are rarely used anymore due to their high potential for abuse and significant withdrawal symptoms. When used safely, benzodiazepines (BDZ) are effective for the short-term management of sleep. They act by enhancing the action of a neurotransmitter GABA (y-Aminobutyric acid) that causes central nervous system depression and sedation. Examples of benzodiazepines used for sleep management include estazolam (ProSom), flurazepam (Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), temazepam (Restoril), and triazolam (Halcion). Their advantages are that they promote sleep and can be used up to 4 months as needed. Their disadvantages are that may lead to daytime drowsiness or hangover and to psychological and physiological dependence and they require a gradual taper to discontinue. Signs of benzodiazepine abuse include ongoing requests for dose escalation, impaired function, overuse, and requests for new prescriptions early. In addition, withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines include nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, sweating, shaking/tremors, and seizures.8 Chronic maintenance on a benzodiazepine for sleep may work fine. However, BDZ may be a short-term solution to a long-term problem. If dose escalation occurs, it merits a re-evaluation of the sleep problem in the context of a co-morbid mental health condition. In a study of 113 patients receiving discontinuation treatment for long-term benzodiazepine use (>3 months), 75% were maintained on a low dose, 50% reported continued therapeutic effectiveness on the same dose without escalation, and many shifted from a prescribed dosing to “as needed” without increasing the dose.9 In clinical practice, patients with severe tinnitus and without a history of substance abuse appear to use the benzodiazepine sparingly when the tinnitus is most severe. However, caution needs to be exercised with patients who have a substance abuse history who are at increased risk for abuse of benzodiazepines. These individuals may derive greater benefit from a different class of medications—sedating antidepressants. Benzodiazepines and tinnitus Benzodiazepines, as both anti-insomnia and anti-anxiety agents, have been studied for tinnitus. The best study on benzodiazepines was a small (n=40), prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study on Tinnitus Registry patients with constant tinnitus of at least 1 year's duration. The study examined the daily use of alprazolam for 58 days. By weeks 4 and 12, at a maximum of 1.5 mg of alprazolam, 76% of the treatment group reported a reduction in loudness measures on objective (tinnitus synthesizer for pitch matching, loudness matching, minimum masking levels, and residual inhibition) and subjective VAS measures, compared to 5% of the placebo group.10 However, a small, double-blind, triple crossover study (n=21) involving diazepam did not show a reduction in tinnitus volume.11 Severe tinnitus may cause anxiety or agitation that interferes with concentration, mood, and daytime function. Cognitive awareness or hyperawareness of the tinnitus may lead to monitoring, which in turn can lead to catastrophic misinterpretation and the belief that tinnitus may become progressively louder.12 This distorted cognitive appraisal may increase tinnitus-associated anxiety or agitation. Benzodiazepines are used for the short-term treatment of acute anxiety, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and panic attacks.13 Non-benzodiazepines While results on benzodiazepines are mixed, empirical use of benzodiazepines reveals that some patients experience benefit with a reduction in loudness and/or annoyance when taken in low divided doses “as needed” across the day. Non-benzodiazepines (NBDZ) are currently more commonly used for insomnia because they have a shorter duration and are less likely to cause a “hangover.” NBDZ have a non-selective action on GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, but, unlike BDZ, they do not provide smooth muscle relaxation or increase the seizure threshold.8 Clinically addressing insomnia in patients with severe tinnitus improves ability to function and tolerate the noxious tinnitus sensation. Advantages of NBDZ include that they are non-addictive and there is no shortening of REM or stage 4 sleep, as with BDZ. Disadvantages are that NBDZ are shorter acting and have been criticized for not providing a sufficient number of hours of sleep due to their shorter action. This has led to controlled-release or extended-release versions. Since these medications affect benzodiazepine receptors, they may present some potential for abuse and should be used with caution. Some patients with severe tinnitus benefit from a NBDZ such that this may be considered helpful for insomnia. The importance of a good night's sleep for people with severe tinnitus cannot be overstated. Just as poor sleep aggravates chronic pain, it also heightens the perception of tinnitus. Restorative sleep often leads to feeling more resilient and better able to cope. Examples of NBDZ are zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata), and ramelteon (Rozerem). ANTIDEPRESSANTS Antidepressant medications were discovered serendipitously with the monoamineoxidase inhibitors (MAOIs- Nardil), and came into use by the 1950s. The tricyclics (TCAs- Elavil) appeared in the 1960s, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs-Prozac) by the late 1980s.14 Norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are all thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Currently, there are several classes of antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), alpha2 noradrenergic antagonists, serotonin 2 agonists/blockers/serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SARIs/SSRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). All antidepressants are considered equally efficacious in that no particular one has shown better than 50%–70% effectiveness with depression.15–16 Antidepressant medications provide a “ceiling” for anxiety and a “floor,” regulating mood and increasing resilience. Non-pharmacologic treatment is provided first and may include structured time, exercise, 10,000-Lux light therapy, and psychological counseling. Severe depression, with its risk of suicide, usually requires medication. Antidepressants have been studied in the treatment of tinnitus with mixed results. A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n=92) of patients with severe tinnitus and depression who were treated with nortriptyline (Pamelor) showed a significant decrease in depression, MPI tinnitus interference, and tinnitus loudness.17 A 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n=76) of patients who were treated with sertraline (Zoloft) also showed a decrease in anxiety, depression, TSQ score, and perceived loudness.18 These studies appear to indicate that for patients with anxiety or depressive symptoms accompanying tinnitus, an antidepressant may help both affective symptoms and tinnitus interference and/or perceived loudness. However, a 31-day, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n=120) of non-depressed patients with severe tinnitus treated with paroxetine (Paxil) showed no differences on anxiety or depression measures, the THQ, or tinnitus loudness.19 The only significant finding in that 2005 study was a post-hoc question posed by the audiologist in which subjects acknowledged a significant decrease in aggravation caused by tinnitus. There is mounting suspicion that tinnitus involves a strong central component with auditory cortical plasticity resulting in changes in the auditory cortex and limbic system.20 Serotonin 5-HT is ubiquitous and plays an important role in altering sensory pathways, modifying emotion, and regulating the sleep/wake cycle.21 It may be that antidepressants address only the cognitive and emotional appraisal of the tinnitus on a continuum from annoyance to aggravation. Antidepressants may provide a small benefit for patients with severe tinnitus with or without significant anxiety or depression if only to reduce the bothersome quality of severe tinnitus. Table 1 contains a summary of the medications discussed in this article.Table 1: Toolbox for severe tinnitus.CONCLUSIONS Persistent, severe tinnitus should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Patients experiencing severe tinnitus deserve the compassion and attention of their audiologist and primary-care clinician along with other specialists as needed. The uncertainty attached to having severe tinnitus along with the etiologic ambiguity is highly stressful. The primary-care clinician should manage the patient's chronic tinnitus just as he or she does other common conditions. Audiology and otolaryngology are in a unique position to provide education to primary-care providers who may not be well-informed about tinnitus etiology and management. With our aging population, tinnitus will likely become an even more significant problem than it is now. Habituation to the distorted tinnitus perception is possible with the wide range of tools available to audiology. Benzodiazepines and antidepressants may address co-morbid target symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, and depression that negatively affect tinnitus perception and lessen coping. The well-being of patients with severe tinnitus depends on seamless communication between the audiologist and the primary-care clinician. It is of utmost importance to replace a delayed and disjointed healthcare response with one that effectively diminishes tinnitus suffering and softens the impact of a chronic condition affecting millions.",

      "title": "Clinical and instrumental features in 82 patients with insufficient sleep syndrome",
      "abstract": "Summary Insufficient sleep syndrome possibly represents the worldwide leading cause of daytime sleepiness, but remains poorly recognised and studied. The aim of this case series is to comprehensively describe a cohort of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome. Eighty‐two patients were studied concerning demographic and socio‐economic features, medical, psychiatric and sleep comorbidities, substance use, sleep symptoms, actigraphy, video‐polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests and treatment. The typical patient with insufficient sleep syndrome is a middle‐aged adult (with no difference of gender), employed, who has a family, often carrying psychiatric and neurological comorbidities, in particular headache, anxiety and depression. Other sleep disorders, especially mild sleep apnea and bruxism, were common as well. Actigraphy was a valuable tool in the characterisation of insufficient sleep syndrome, showing a sleep restriction during weekdays, associated with a recovery rebound of night sleep during weekends and a high amount of daytime sleep. An over‐ or underestimation of sleeping was common, concerning both the duration of night sleep and daytime napping. The average daily sleep considering both daytime and night‐time, weekdays and weekends corresponds to the recommended minimal normal duration, meaning that the burden of insufficient sleep syndrome could mainly depend on sleep fragmentation and low quality. Sleep efficiency was elevated both in actigraphy and video‐polysomnography. Multiple sleep latency tests evidenced a tendency toward sleep‐onset rapid eye movement periods. Our study offers a comprehensive characterisation of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome, and clarifies their sleeping pattern, opening avenues for management and treatment of the disorder. Current options seem not adapted, and in our opinion a cognitive‐behavioural psychotherapy protocol should be developed.",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years.

      "abstract": "Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep disorder, is commonly associated with other mental and somatic disorders, making it a significant health concern. It is characterized by nighttime symptoms and daytime dysfunction, with sleepiness being a potential criterion for the latter. Sleepiness is a normal physiological state that is typically experienced near usual bedtime, in normal circumstances. In insomnia, it seems somewhat logical the idea that there is significant daytime sleepiness. However, the topic has been the subject of various discussions in sleep medicine, with studies yielding contradictory and inconsistent results. In this article, we aim to critically examine daytime sleepiness in individuals with insomnia disorder and propose an alternative approach to addressing it, both in clinical practice and research settings. It is crucial to further investigate the role of daytime sleepiness in insomnia, particularly by focusing on sleepiness perception as a more relevant dimension to explore in majority of patients. It is plausible that certain insomnia phenotypes are objectively sleepy during the day, but more studies are necessary, particularly with well-defined clinical samples. The implications of assessing sleepiness perception in insomnia for clinical practice are discussed, and new avenues for research are suggested.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

Most patients with REM behavior disorder will eventually manifest neurodegenerative diseases like parkinsonism, dementia with Lewy body, or multisystem atrophy.There are also secondary causes of RBD associated with narcolepsy or use of antidepressant medications.A patient may be warned about the future development of these neurological disorders. Treatment consists of preventive measures while sleeping to avoid injury to the patient as well as the bed partner. In severe cases, the patient may be prescribed melatonin or clonazepam.",

      "title": "Monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis.",
      "abstract": "In brief, therefore, we are dealing with an illness characterised by a single delusional system - in this instance with hypochondriacal content - which can occur at any age from late adolescence onwards, appears to affect the sexes equally, and has a very poor prognosis without treatment. Its presentation appears to be relatively independent of cultural factors. A previous history, or a family history, of psychotic illness seems very uncommon. However, substance abuse and/or head injury seem to be background factors in a high proportion of younger patients and I would speculate about the role of the ageing brain in the more elderly patients. Within the delusional system, the patient shows marked illogicality insisting, against all evidence, on a physical aetiology, going to many physicians, and initiating strange 'cures' of his own. Although paranoid anger is not uncommonly a feature, secondary depression, shame and avoidant behaviour are more frequent. The illness causes great anguish, and sometimes suicide. Folie à deux is relatively common. At present, pimozide appears to be the most specific treatment and can be dramatically effective. There are scattered reports of improvement or even cure with other neuroleptics or tricyclic antidepressants but, in general, these seem less effective than pimozide (Cashman & Pollock, 1983; Brotman & Jenike, 1984; Pylko & Sicignan, 1985). However, a single case report recently from the USA is intriguing: an apparently excellent result with amoxapine, currently perhaps the most antidopaminergic of the antidepressant drugs (Tollefson, 1985). However, although the case description is suggestive of MHP, the author regards it as one of major depressive illness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

The differential diagnosis for social anxiety includes panic disorder, agoraphobia, atypical depression, and body dysmorphic disorder. Treatment for social anxiety can be quite effective and consists of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy (including such medications as beta-blockers, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants), or a combination.

      "title": "Parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical and/or experiential phenomena accompanying sleep that involve skeletal muscle activity (movements, behaviours), autonomic nervous system changes, and/or emotional-perceptual events. Parasomnias can emerge during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of sleep; therefore, all of sleep carries a vulnerability for parasomnias. Parasomnias can be objectively diagnosed by means of polysomnography (i.e. the physiologic monitoring of sleep—figures 4.14.4.1, 4.14.4.2), and can be successfully treated in the majority of cases. Understanding of the parasomnias, based on polysomnographic documentation, has expanded greatly over the past two decades, as new disorders have been identified, and as known disorders have been recognized to occur more frequently, across a broader age group, and with more serious consequences than previously understood. Parasomnias demonstrate how our instinctual behaviours, such as locomotion, feeding, sex, and aggression, can be released during sleep, itself a basic instinct. There are at least eight reasons why parasomnias should be of interest and importance to psychiatrists: 1 Parasomnias can be misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated as a psychiatric disorder. 2 Parasomnias can be a direct manifestation of a psychiatric disorder, e.g. dissociative disorder, nocturnal bulimia nervosa. 3 The emergence and/or recurrence of a parasomnia can be triggered by stress. 4 Psychotropic medications can induce the initial emergence of a parasomnia, or aggravate a preexisting parasomnia. 5 Parasomnias can cause psychological distress or can induce or reactivate a psychiatric disorder in the patient or bed partner on account of repeated loss of self-control during sleep and sleep-related injuries. 6 Familiarity with the parasomnias will allow psychiatrists to be more fully aware of the various medical and neuro-logical disorders, and their therapies, that can be associated with disturbed (sleep-related) behaviour and disturbed dreaming. 7 Parasomnias present a special opportunity for interlinking animal basic science research (including parasomnia animal models) with human (sleep) behavioural disorders. 8 Parasomnias carry forensic implications, as exemplified by the newly-recognized entity of ‘Parasomnia Pseudo-suicide.’ Also, psychiatrists are often asked to render an expert opinion in medicolegal cases pertaining to sleep-related violence.",

      "abstract": "The content of thought, which emerges from the processing of information from the social context lived, is a critical factor that guides whether the behavior is psychopathological or not. In cases where worry, anxiety and fear are dominant in the content of thought, the individual may find himself in some psychopathological processes. Adversity and uncertainty are the main factors that lead to the experience of worry, anxiety and fear which is the last point of these. Uncertainty of information from the social context lived, when matched with adversity, may lead to chaotic situations at the cognitive level, e.g., thought contents such as distortions in thought, severe anxiety and fear. Obsessive compulsive disorder derives from severe worry and anxiety. Although the disorder is classified under anxiety disorders, it is actually a thought distortion disorder. The individual finds himself repeating the strange behavior patterns accompanied by strange thought contents in order to get rid of the severe anxiety and accelerated thought cycle he is exposed to. Ambiguity and uncertainty also may lead to the accelerated thought cycle, ruminations, severe thought distortions, over-generalizations. Ruminations, especially, impair the individual’s ability to think and process emotions gradually. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder will be discussed in terms of ambiguity and uncertainty with the combination of adversity. Positive Psychotherapy, which is one of the latest effective technique in recovery processes of the diseases, will be mentioned.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) dominate the clinical picture, the nonmotor complaints are often more disabling for the Parkinson patient. REVIEW SUMMARY Behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive changes occur commonly and are frequent causes for concern. Depression affects up to half of Parkinson patients and can worsen their motor function. Drug-induced psychoses can range from benign visual hallucinations to paranoid delusions. Dementia, classically described as subcortical, usually occurs in the elderly PD patient and is often clinically distinct from the cortical dementia of Alzheimer's disease although pathological descriptions overlap. A parkinsonian personality has been noted by psychoanalysts and movement disorder experts characterized as rigid and compulsive yet cautious and apprehensive with a subordinate behavior. Sleep disturbances associated with PD include insomnia, sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, vivid dreams, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Sensory symptoms, including pain, may occur, as do symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including postural syncope. Problems with bladder and bowel control and sexual dysfunction are common and often distressing to both the patients and their partners. Fatigue, akathisia, seborrheic dermatitis, and scoliosis are conditions intrinsic to or aggravated by PD. Most of these problems are amenable to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. CONCLUSION Helping patients with PD cope with these difficulties is just as important as manipulating therapy to provide control of their motor symptoms. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:18-27, 2000)",

      "abstract": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Delirium is common among critically ill patients and it prolongs the length of ICU and hospital stays and is associated with worse outcomes, including cognitive impairment and increased mortality. No medications have been shown to have a consistent therapeutic benefit. Delirium is a form of brain dysfunction characterized by the acute onset of fluctuating mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. These features are also seen in states of acute sleep deprivation. It is believed that the state of delirium contributes to disrupted sleep just as sleep deprivation is considered a modifiable risk factor for delirium. Improving sleep conditions and other nonpharmacologic interventions to promote sleep may be an underused approach to preventing and treating delirium in critical illness.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep (1). Contrary to popular belief, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most common causes of insomnia (1). In fact, untreated insomnia, itself, is a risk factor for the subsequent development of clinical depression and psychiatric distress (2).",

      "title": "0978 I Cannot Stay Still - A Case of Sleep-Related Rhythmic Movement Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder (SRRMD) is characterized by repetitive rhythmic motor behaviors involving large muscle groups that occur predominantly during stage N1 sleep. SSRMs are common in infants and children but they usually spontaneously resolve before adolescence. This case presents a rare adult case of SRRMD. Report of case(s) A 60-year-old man initially presents to clinic for evaluation of repetitive movements needed to initiate sleep. Patient reports the problem starting in his childhood, where he needs to rock and roll intentionally in bed to fall asleep. He had been prescribed clonazepam 2mg and had been taking this along with doxylamine and melatonin nightly, but still reports frequent nocturnal awakenings due to body rolling. He specifically denies any hypnic kicking/jerking, or discomfort in legs while falling asleep. Patient has no excessive alcohol consumption, marijuana, or illicit drug use. Differentials for the patient’s condition include hyperarousal, chronic anxiety, iron deficiency, sleep-related breathing disorder, and rhythmic movement disorder. Patient consequently underwent an in-lab diagnostic polysomnography study which showed no evidence of sleep-related breathing disorders with AHI of 1.6 (AASM 3%). Sleep efficiency was low at 60.8% and sleep architecture showed decreased REM sleep and decreased N3 sleep. Rhythmic movements were noted during sleep and it was manifested by excessive transient muscle activity in both limb &amp; chin EMG leads and also whole body rocking in the video recording. Moderate periodic limb movements were noted with PLM index to 17. Patient was seen in clinic 6 months later with persistent symptoms and his dose of clonazepam was increased slowly to 2.5 mg and then 3 mg. On the 3 mg of clonazepam, patient had resolution of symptoms. Conclusion Our case describes a patient who had SRRMs that commenced in childhood persisting well into adulthood. Reported adult cases of SRRMD are few, and have been associated with sleep apnea, REM sleep behavior disorder, and RLS, while many remain idiopathic such as the case with this patient. While benzodiazepines are still first line for SRRMD, further work up and investigation into possible comorbid conditions could yield insight into the etiology and offer alternative treatment options to patients.

It is of equal importance compared with others in the 21st century. Stress management is a common phenomenon globally. The imbalance of any occasion creates stress. The most significant factors include separated from family, loneliness, fatigue, multi-nationality, limited recreation activity, and dissatisfaction of job opportunity, which tends to cause healthcare issues, especially sleep deprivation and depression. The long-lasting stress causes chronic mental fatigue. It has positive and negative impacts, which depend on situations.

      "title": "Personality disorders a main risk for panic disorder",
      "abstract": "This chapter presents an overview of the major categories of mental illness and mental retardation. It also describes the procedures for formulating a diagnosis and the role of the correctional counselor in assisting the diagnostic process.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, generally known as the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) is considered the \"bible\" of mental health disorders and their descriptions. DSM-IV-TR lists 16 major diagnostic classes, but those most commonly seen in corrections include mood disorders, psychotic disorders, mental retardation, personality disorders, and substance-abuse dependence.Mood disorders are among the more common forms of mental disturbance; however, they can range in intensity from mild to severe where daily functioning can be disrupted for a significant period of time. Major depressive disorder is characterized by a persistent depressed mood, frequent crying, lack of interest in almost all activities, problems sleeping, lethargy, feelings of worthlessness, problems concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. A dysthymic disorder is also a depressive disorder but tends to be more chronic in duration. In contrast, a manic disorder is characterized by an experience of intense elation or sometimes an irritable mood. The individual may experience feelings of grandiosity, a decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, difficulties with attention, physical or mental agitation, and an over-involvement in activities that are experienced as pleasurable without regard to any risk involved. Persons with bipolar disorder cycle through manic episodes and depressive episodes. Some of these disorders may occur in response to environmental factors.Psychotic disorders, on the other hand, tend to be pre-existing and they do not occur on a continuum from mild to severe. One cannot be mildly psychotic. Psychotic disorders are those in which the person has an impaired sense of reality. The symptoms of schizophrenia, for example, include disorganization in speech and behavior, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling things that are not there), or delusions (having erroneous beliefs that involve a misinterpretation of an event or experience), flat affect, problems initiating activities, ritualistic behavior, and limited connections with others. Because these individuals act on information that is not shared by others, their actions can be quite unpredictable.A diagnosis of mental retardation now requires an IQ score of about 70 or below with an inability to cope with common life demands. Mentally retarded individuals are likely to have trouble coping in prison settings, experiencing difficulties following directions. They may also be vulnerable to being victimized or manipulated by other inmates. Mild mental retardation and borderline intellectual functioning tends to be more common to correctional settings. These individuals may have higher IQ scores than mentally retarded individuals but may still have major adjustment problems.Personality disorders are defined as \"… an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture (American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 686). Personality disorders begin in adolescence or early adulthood. These disorders are grouped into clusters based on common dimensions. Cluster A, the odd-eccentric cluster, contains the personality disorders of paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. These disorders are characterized by a pervasive mistrust, a preference for isolation, an inability to experience a wide range of emotions, a pervasive tendency to distort perceptions and information, odd and/or magical thinking, an unusual appearance, and behaviors that are eccentric or bizarre.Cluster B, which covers the dramatic–emotional dimension, contains the diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder. In general, these disorders are marked by a disregard for the normal expectations of society or social relationships, a lack of empathy for others, impulsivity, irritability or mood swings, irresponsible behaviors, deceitfulness, difficult interpersonal relationships, substance abuse, difficulties with controlling emotions, a tendency to engage in self-destructive behaviors, a desire to be the center of attention at all times, and a sense of low self-worth that gets communicated as either grandiosity or as self-degradation.The last cluster, C, covers the anxious–fearful dimension and includes the personality disorders of avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. People with personality disorders have difficulty coping with stressful events; their judgment tends to worsen as their stress levels increase. They may be manipulative and impulsive, and may harm themselves or threaten suicide when angry or unable to cope.Offenders addicted to drugs or alcohol are diagnosed as substance-dependent or substance abusing. The substance-dependent individuals have developed tolerance for the substance and will have withdrawal associated with cessation of use. They are unable to cut down on use, and take the substance in larger amounts over time. In addition, substance dependence leads to a decrease in other social, occupational, and recreational activities, as well as an increase in the amount of time spent in activities surrounding obtaining the drug. Substance-abusing individuals have not developed a tolerance to drugs or alcohol but tend to use substances in dangerous situations and continue to use in spite of persistent problems caused by such use.Suicide is not a diagnostic category, but it is important because of the increased incidence of suicide in correctional settings, especially jails. Suicide can be associated with almost any category of mental disturbance, including substance abuse. While there is no single indicator that will alert the mental health professional to suicide, most people who commit suicide have spoken about it to someone. All suicidal statements and attempts should be taken seriously.The diagnoses listed above are determined by clinical psychologists or psychiatrists aided by a number of personality, intelligence, and other mental health assessments. An in-depth interview with the client helps to put these assessments in the contexts of the client's life. Counselors and other correctional professions provide important observational information. They are often the first to recognize a problem, and must report the behavioral characteristics of the client (e.g., not sleeping) rather than their assumptions (seems depressed). Their observations should also mention the patterns of the client's behavior, indicating when it occurs, its frequency, and its context.Sometimes these mental health assessments impact a defendant's legal status. On very rare occasions, diagnoses may factor into an insanity defense, or a determination of not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI). In such instances, the diagnosis is one of several criteria examined in an attempt to determine a defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense. More commonly, one's mental state may affect one's competency to stand trial. These determine the defendant's mental state at the time of a trial or other legal proceeding. Both decisions are legal concepts rather than mental-health concepts, and both decisions are made by the court rather than mental-health practitioners.",

      "title": "Hypnosis as an Adjunct to Anesthesia in Children",
      "abstract": "Most children anticipate the prospect of submitting to surgery and anesthesia with fear and apprehension. Youngsters who have to be given an anesthetic are afraid that something disastrous may happen to them while they are asleep. The child fears not only what he can understand but also what is less understandable, such as will he ever wake up or is he going to be killed? There are many connections in the child's mind between anesthesia, sleep, and death.1 When a child is brought to the operating room heavily premedicated or asleep, without having his fears allayed or his anxieties resolved, he will usually experience a nightmare of restlessness on recovery. During such a confused and stressful state, a child is more subject to psychic trauma than one who will recover quickly and quietly to a state of full consciousness and awareness.2 Sleep disturbances, temper tantrums, hallucinatory phenomena, and dependency reactions have been reported after surgical procedures where anesthesia was administered.3 In order to cope with this situa¬ tion, anesthesiologists in recent years have become more aware and better oriented to the psychological aspects of anesthesia for children.4·5 It is but a short step in inducing anesthe¬ sia in children with the use of stories, music, and flavoring agents to the superior effec¬ tiveness of an hypnotic induction. With children, relaxation by means of hypnosis is worth while. The comparative ease of inducing hypnosis in many children is a surprising finding. More than half of them can reach a sufficient hypnotic depth to permit minor surgical procedures, such as venipuncture, spinal tap, and reduction of simple fractures, to be performed. Hypnosis is a valuable method of inducing anesthesia or achieving basal anesthesia in children.6·7 Hypnotic inductions permit the use of posthypnotic suggestions that render recovery from anesthesia less distressing and more pleasant. Results in such cases are gratifying, because on recovery these children are quieter, more comfortable, and more cooperative than those who undergo anesthesia induced by chemical agents alone. Although hypnosis may be performed suc¬ cessfully in younger children on occasion, youngsters between the ages of 7 and 14 years are the most susceptible. These chil¬ dren usually make good subjects because of their heightened powers of imagination and their ability to play a role or create a fantasy. I try to use the child's own experiences—things with which he is famil¬ iar, so that better imagery can be produced. If children are admitted the day prior to surgery, a visit may be made in the after¬ noon or evening in order to take advantage of the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the child and to ascertain his area of interests. If it is possible to have a pre¬ liminary rehearsal of the hypnotic induction, it will serve the anesthesiologist well. How¬ ever, no attempt should be made to force the situation. For children admitted in the early morning for surgery a few hours later",

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder (PD)",
      "abstract": "Participants of expert group on CPG for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder S.C Tiwari, Nilesh Shah, I.D. Gupta, B.N. Gangadhar, Devendra Vijay Vergiya, Pratap Sharan INTRODUCTION Short description of anxiety disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Definition: One of the anxiety disorders, where the primary symptoms of anxiety are present at most days for at least several weeks at a time, and usually for several months. The symptoms should usually involve elements of: Apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \" on edge\", etc) Motor tension (restlessness, inability to relax, trembling) Autonomic over activity (light-headedness, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, dry mouth etc) The transient appearance of depressive symptoms, does not rule out the diagnosis of GAD as main diagnosis. The sufferer must not meet the full criteria for depressive episode, phobic disorder, panic disorder or OCD. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder have high anxiety and are worried about intrapsychic conflicts or external environmental events. They have multiple somatic symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, difficulty in concentration, irritability, fatigue, muscular tensions and difficulty in sleeping particularly early insomnia. They have vague apprehension about future events and fear of unknown. Common features observed in anxiety disorders include: Panic Disorder- Episodes of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by severe autonomic activity, palpitations, sweating, dyspnoea, chocking sensation or other somatic symptoms like chest pain, trembling, nausea, discomfort or fluttering sensation in abdomen and impending fear of death. Patient perceives it as a serious medical condition and invariably reaches to a medical emergency setup where after thorough physical evaluation he is declared normal. Phobias- Many patients with GAD suffer from irrational, unrealistic fears and acute autonomic reactions to certain specific situations or extreme fear to certan inanimate objects. They include agarophobia (fear of open spaces) fear of crowds, being out side home alone or traveling in a bus train or car. Some may have fear in closed spaces (claustrophobia) fear of heights (acrophobia) fear of opposite sex (hetero-phobia) fear of sight of blood (erythrophobia) or fear of facing certain social situations (social anxiety disorder) the common feature among all phobias being intense fear, increased autonomic activity and avoidance behavior (avoiding the fearful object or situation). Obsessive compulsive disorder- (OCD) has been seperately dealt with in details in these guidelines however the patients suffering from OCD have recurrent repetitive unwanted intrinsic thoughts (obsessions) or actions (compulsions) or both which lead to extreme distress, loss of time and impairment of functioning of the individual. The obsessious include douts, ideas of contamination, sexual thoughts or religious preoccupations or negative thoughts towards gods/goddess, the compulsions include activities like counting, checking, repeating, washing hoarding and touching objects, some have to and fro movements of body parts. Patient is aware of the irrationality of thoughts/actions but cannot control them, which produces intense anxiety and autonomic arousal with feelings of helplessness and guilt. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Usually it occurs after a terrifying event that involving physical or psychological traumatic event. It may also occure because of witnessing or experiencing a serious harm to other significant persons in life. Patients have terrifying recollections of the event, or nightmares. Some patients have an experience of living the event in an illusionary or imaginary situation with hallucinations, or flashback episodes. The patients suffer from intense psychological or physical distress. Many patients develop loss of interest, estrangement from others, sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. This phenomenon may persist for one month or more before it is diagnosed. Natural history and course The age of onset is difficult to specify, as most of the patients have been anxious for long but report late. Nearly 1/3rd of the patients who have GAD seek psychiatric treatment. Many go to GPs, physicians, cardiologist, chest specialist for the somatic component of the disorder. Because of the high incidence of co-morbid mental disorders, the course and prognosis is difficult to predict. The occurrence of several negative life events greatly increases the likelihood that the disorder will develop. In all, a chronic condition may be life long. COMMON INGREDIENTS OF MANAGEMENT PLAN (FLOW CHART-1 AND 2)FLOW CHART 1. Management of Generalized Anxiety DisorderFLOW CHART 2. Management of Panic DisorderThe aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following ways. 1. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times required as long as 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. 2. Psychotherapy Cognitive behaviour therapy Behavioural techniques Supportive Psychotherapy Insight oriented Psychotherapy Goals Psycho-education Direct explanation of the symptoms and disorder to the patient and the family. Monitoring of anxiety Cognitive restructuring: Corrects the hypothesized cognitive distortions and helps to identify and counter fear of bodily sensations. Efficacy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has proven efficy other psychotherapies do help in ameliorating symptoms of anxiety. It addresses cognitive distortions and somatic symptoms. More effective with chronically anxious patients, may need 8-10 sessions. It has been shown that yogic techniques produced greater motivation to practice than progressive relaxation Meditation was found to be as effective as pharmacotherapy in controlling symptoms of anxiety. The overall efficacy claims are backed by very few Indian studies, but are useful. It requires considerable time and discipline from the patients. Adverse effects These are relatively benign. Some patients may develop dependence on the therapist and that needs cautious vigil. 3. Combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention Long-term outcome is better when they are used in combination. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION 1. Performing a diagnostic evaluation Psychiatric evaluation and physical examination is necessary. It includes history of present illness, current symptoms; past psychiatric history, general medical history and history of substance use, personal history (eg. psychological development, life events and response to those events), social, occupational and family history; review of the patient's medications; physical and mental status examination and adequate diagnostic tool and criteria. Diagnose GAD according to ICD-10 (W.H.0,1992). Anxiety should not be due to the other Axis I disorder (eg. mood disorder, psychotic disorder, social phobia, OCD, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD) or a general medical condition (eg. hyperthyroidism) or substance use disorder (intoxication or withdrawal), (see appendix-1 for flow chart). 2. Evaluating particular symptoms Patients experience excessive anxiety but many of them experience panic attacks, which may worsen the clinical picture. The prolonged illness may cause depressive symptoms with emergence of suicidality and substance abuse. 3. Evaluating severity of functional impairment Many may continue to function in their social and occupational lives with some impairment, others may become severely incapacitated and give up their jobs and social duties. The impairment in different areas can be assessed self-administered visual analog scale. FORMULATING TREATMENTS AND CHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS The aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following way. 1. Establishing and maintaining atherapeutic alliance The treatment of GAD may be long lasting hence the alliance is crucial. Understanding the life events, the extent and severity of symptoms requires confiding and lasting therapeutic relationship. Attention to the patient's worries and fears are essential for long term gains 2. Monitoringthe patient's psychiatric status The symptomatic improvement in psychological and autonomic symptoms leads to greater confidence in the treating doctor. The anxiety goes slowly with treatment and bursts of severe symptoms during the treatment need constant monitoring. 3. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times is seen as a 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. a). Goals Reduce psychological and autonomic symptoms and other co morbid conditions. Improve occupational and social functioning. b). Efficacy Little Indian data to address the issue; mainly western data available. c). Adverse effects Different for different class of drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and pregabalin are recommended as first line drugs due to their favorable risk-benefit ratio, with some differentiation regarding the various anxiety disorders. The common category of pharmacological agents used in management of generialised anxiety disorders include SSRIs, SNRIs, Pregabalin, TCAs, Benzodiazepines, Antihistamines, Atypical antipsychotics, and Antioxidants. Role of vitamin A, C and E has been evaluated and recommended in adequate doses for patients suffering from GAD. Dosing Majority of patients respond to the low dose of antidepressants (with the exception of OCD). In the elderly, treatment should be started with half the recommended dose or less in order to minimize initial adverse drug events. The antidepressant dose should be increased to the highest recommended therapeutic level if the initial treatment with a low or medium dose fails. For patients who do not improve with standard treatments, a number of alternative options should be tried including augmentation with small dose of antipsychotics or adding another anxiolytic agent or addition of non-pharmacological therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Yoga, Meditation and increased physical activity as described below. 4. Non-pharmacological treatment Non pharmacological treatment found useful in treatment of anxiety disorders include supportive therapy, Exposure therapy (e.g. gradual exposure in vivo, \"flooding\") and response prevention. Psychoeducational advice, and suggesions to not to avoid feared situations are helpful in management. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Adequate strength of evidence is available for Individual CBT, Group CBT and Self-directed CBT. Choosing between medications and CBT is determined by a number of factors, particularly the patient's preference, treatment options at hand, adverse drug effects, onset of efficacy, comorbidity (e.g. with depression), financial considerations, time availability, accessibility of psychiatric and psychological treatment resources, and experience of the clinician. Steps of CBT shall include: Psychoeducation Self-monitoring Systemic exposure to panic inducing cues Countering anxious beliefs Exposure to fear cues Modify [mal-adaptive behaviors Relapse prevention Dealing with transference issues Resolving interpersonal and other emotional issues. Initial expectations and anticipation favoring CBT Accept that the worrying is out of control Perhaps, worrying offers some protective value. CBT will facilitate future adversities, despite the worrying. During the course of the treatment, revised understanding: The reasons for worrying and fears cannot be controlled Subjectively learn to control response to the fears and worries Learn to obviate the behaviour of worrying Worrying does not have a protective value Actually, worrying reinforces negative thinking Excesive worrying increases likely hood or more anxieties in the future CBT does not alter the method of managing source of the worries CBT helps to be better equipped to handle the future stress. Indian modules of psychotherapy Several therapists have talked about Search of Indian module of psychotherapy and it is a felt need to have such a module, which is socially and culturally relevant. Ancient Indian thought has provided very rich knowledge regarding mind and its functioning. From the Vedic period issues relating to mind, consciousness, understanding of human life, its existence and the concept of Atman have been widely studied and several explanations to improve the quality of human life are available in Vedic and Post Vedic literature. The Bhagvad Gita contains in condensed form all the philosophical and psycholoical wisdom of the Upanishads. Bhagwad Gita describes all aspects of yoga, psychology and is unique among the psychlogical and philosophical teachings for a student of psychotherapy, various aspects of psychotherapeutic techniques are described in it. In this excellent module of Psychotherapy through 18 chapters way of self knowledge, the Yoga of action (karma) knowledge of renunciation and action, the path of meditation, knowledge of the absolute and eternal, yogic vision, yoga of devotion, profound knowledge of three Gunas and the wisdom of renunciation and liberation have been described at length, which leads to personality transformation of Arjuna. In the modern psychotherapy, cognitive restructuring is the goal of psychotherapy, which has been accomplished a great deal through Bhagwad Gita. Prekshadhayan A Jain Meditational technique propounded by Acharya Mahapragya, which includes relaxation, meditation, yoga, asanas and pranayam, a comprehensive capsule of behavioural management has been tried in management of GAD. On mental level, it proves to be an applied method to train the mind to concentrate. It offers a way to treat serious anxiety disorders with or without drugs. Large trials of this technique are still awaited. At present, few scientific studies are available. 5. Providing Education To The Patient And Family This seemingly unimportant aspect is most relevant to Indian settings where awareness of psychiatric illness and its realization and need for treatment with compliance is little. Many feel dejected, angry, isolated and may have suicidal ideas. Family and the patient need to be told that this is like any other illness that needs treatment and success depends on compliance. 6. Addressing early signs of relapse The education that the illness is a chronic relapsing illness is essential and emergence of anxiety with or without treatment should be promptly treated. Sudden discontinuation may lead to emergence of withdrawal symptoms thus early recognition by the patient and the family helps in prompt treatment. MANAGEMENT AS PER THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE ILLNESS The treatment recommendations for the different anxiety disorders are summarized in Table I. Some antianxiety drugs are effective in all anxiety disorders, whereas some drugs have only been studied in specific anxiety disorders and thus should be reserved for use in these particular disorders. Panic disorder and agoraphobia. In acute panic attacks, mouth desolving short-acting benzodiazepines and reassurance to the patient may be sufficient. SSRIs SNRIs are first-line treatments for longterm management. Patients should be treated for atleast six to eight months or longer to prevent relapses. A combination of CBT and anxiolytic medication has been shown to have the best treatment outcomes. In GAD and Social anxiety disorder (SAD): Choice of Drugs for Management are SSRIs, SNRIs and pregabalin. Buspirone and hydroxyzine are second line treatment. Benzodiazepines should only be used for long-term treatment when other drugs or CBT have not shown results. Specific phobia: Specific phobia should be treated with behaviour therapy including systematic desensatisation. SSRIs or short acting benzodiazepines should be tried in cases not responding to behaviour therapy. OCD: Choice of treatments is the SSRIs and the TCA clomipramine. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention are other proven techniques of management. PTSD: Choice of treatments includes the SSRIs and venlafaxine. Therapeutic conversation, psychoeducation and regrief therapy are non-pharmacological treatment techniques advocated. TREATMENT UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS (FLOW CHART-3)FLOW CHART 3. Management of Anxiety Disorders in Special PopulationPregnancy. The use of SSRIs and TCAs in pregnancy does not have increased risk for malformations. It is recommended to avoid paroxetine alprazolam use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant. Breast-feeding. SSRIs and TCAs are excreted into breast milk, they do not cause any harm to the new born because the concentration in breast milk is very small however infants of mothers on benzodiazepines, should be observed for signs of sedation, lethargy, poor suckling, and weight loss, and if high doses have to be used and long-term administration is required, breast feeding should probably be discontinued. Treating children and adolescents. Choice of treatment should be SSRIs concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior have ben reported therefore careful monitoring is advisable, presence of comorbid depression should be looked fore. Treating the elderly. Elderly have increased sensitivity for anticholinergic properties, an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension, and ECG changes during treatment with TCAs, and possible paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, which include depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, or violent behavior. Thus, treatment with TCAs or benzodiazepines is less favorable, while SSRIs appear to be safe. Treatment of patients with severe Physical disease. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and endocrine disease, irritable bowel syndrome, malignency, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hyperthyroidism may have associated anxiety reactions with their somatic disease state. Such anxiety disorders may compound the management and the prognosis of these primary conditions. Advocated pharmacological agents in such conditions include SSRIs and Venlafaxine. WHEN TO STOP TREATMENT Decesion to stop treatment will depend on clinical response of the patients. Usualy the treatment is stopped in a tapering manner after atleast 6 months stability of clinical improvement and asymptomatic status of the patient. Before stopping the treatment, the nature of illness possibilities of recurrence, response to triggers and his/her ability to cope with the situation should be discussed at length. Patient's personal view should be included in decesion making of stopping the treatment. Patient should be encouraged to adapt alternative methods of anxiety reduction like yoga, pranayam, relaxation techniques including progressive muscular relaxation (PMR)/Shavasan etc. which can be mastered by him before weaning off the smallest dose of antianxiety medication. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MBCBT) for reducing cognitive and somatic anxiety and modifying dysfunctional cognitions in patients with anxiety disorders has been tried where in different versions of mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and strategies to handle worry, such as, worry postponement, worry exposure, and problem solving have been employed. However, these studies are on small number of patients and need carefull review for further application. MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION Diffrent side effects will emerge with different category of antianxiety medication. They should be carefully observed and addressed to. Side effects of medication can be drug related or dose related. If it is drug, related, alternative class of drug should be tried for adequate length of time. If it is dose related then the dose of the drug has to be reduced. Things to remember for GAD: Anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects to be kept in mind when using tricyclic and Tetra cyclic for side effects. Precaution in suicidal patients. Long-term treatment may be required. Psychopharmacological therapy combined with psychotherapy works better.",

This review highlights neuropsychiatric and cognitive observations that have direct relevance to patient care and outcome.Delirium is a common event, especially the hypoactive forms in the elderly. The recognition of significant cognitive dysfunction is worrying since it has profound implications for how we treat and manage patients within intensive care and beyond. The most important message is that the 'awake' intensive care unit patient is not necessarily free of significant brain dysfunction. There is also the added complication of psychological disturbances related to real or imagined delusional experiences underlying the importance of memory and recall. Longer-term implications, particularly debilitating conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, mean that there is a need for improved post-intensive care unit rehabilitation care.Health professionals working with the critically ill must routinely include the assessment of brain cognitive function. While some of the consequences may be unavoidable, we need to reassess our sedation and care practices to ensure we are not confounding the problem. Practical options to improve outcome are being developed and emphasise that the recovery from critical illness is psychological as well as physical.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are disabling conditions. In anxiety disorders, the person experiences severe, often persistent (or recurrent) anxiety that is excessive and/or inappropriate to the situation. They often co-exist with other psychiatric conditions (depression, substance abuse). In medical or surgical disorders, distinguishing ‘normal’ anxiety from an anxiety disorder requiring treatment can be very difficult. This chapter presents the key features of anxiety, the main anxiety disorder subtypes, and the varied reactions to stress and trauma. The focus is on using the person’s symptoms to both understand their presentation (making the diagnosis) and to engage them in treatment. The chapter opens by presenting elements of anxiety that are easily understood and are present in all anxiety disorders, proceeding to highlight clinical features, course, and treatment for each of the main anxiety and obsessional disorders. This chapter provides <bold>knowledge</bold> about: • Physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. • Shared features of anxiety disorders. • Specific features, course, and treatment of each of the disorders, including phobias, panic disorder, hypochondriasis, obsessive–compulsive disorder, acute stress reaction, and post-traumatic stress disorder. <bold>Practical tips</bold> include: • Key items to consider in diagnosing anxiety disorders. • Disorders to exclude. • The components of the anxiety triad.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

Majority of these problems are transitory and self-limiting and usually are not recognized by first care physicians and need education.Analysis of sleep structure at the developmental age and of sleep disorders associated with different sleep phases on the basis of video/polysomnography results.Literature review and illustration of fundamental problems associated with sleep physiology and pathology, with special attention to paroxysmal disorders. Additionally 4 cases from our own experience were presented with neurophysiological and clinical aspects.Discussion on REM and NREM sleep, its phases and alternating share according to child's age was conducted. Sleep disorders were in accordance with their international classification. Parasomnias, occupying most of the space, were divided in two groups: primary and secondary. Among primary parasomnias disorders associated with falling asleep (sleep myoclonus, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome) are important. Another disorders are parasomians associated with light NREM sleep (bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder) and with deeper NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnabulism, night terrors), with REM sleep (nightmares, REM sleep behavior disorder) and associated with NREM and REM sleep (catathrenia, sleep enuresis, sleep talking). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and epileptic seizures occurring during sleep also play an important role. Frontal lobe epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome should be considered in the first place in such cases. Our 4 cases document these diagnostic difficulties, requiring video/polysomnography examination 2 of them illustrate frontal lobe epilepsy and single ones myoclonic epilepsy graphy in children is a difficult technique and requires special device, local and trained personnel. It is crucial in gathering objective data about sleep disorders.Correct diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders during sleep in children is possible thanks to video/polysomnography, and enables proper management and pharmacotherpy. It enables improvement or cure disorders during the sleep and moreover enables the obtainment of positive changes in child's every day life.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are central features of many movement disorders, exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms and impairing quality of life. Understanding these disturbances to sleep is clinically important and may further our understanding of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the current anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and the recognised primary sleep disorders. In addition, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for disruption to sleep across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for the alpha synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years. Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medication used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affects sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is also some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, an ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep and to treat sleep disturbance to improve quality of life. Key sleep disorders also act as important biomarkers and have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and the development of future therapies.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias.

Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

      "title": "Touching the unconscious in the unconscious – hypnotic communication with unconscious patients",
      "abstract": "If hypnosis means contact to the unconscious to modulate psychological and physiological functions by means of suggestions, and if this is facilitated by attenuation of the critical mind, then the question arises as to whether suggestions also have an effect when waking consciousness is otherwise eliminated, namely by coma or anesthesia. A prerequisite would be perception, which actually is evidenced by reports of patients after traumatic brain injury, artificial coma, resuscitation or general anesthesia. Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently observed after these medical situations is hardly explainable without some sort of awareness under such conditions. Even advanced neurophysiological diagnostic cannot yet rule out consciousness or sensory processing. Especially reference to perception during unconsciousness is given by the results of a recent multicenter study on the effects of hypnotic communication with patients under controlled adequate deep general anesthesia. The observed reductions in incidence and severity of postoperative pain, opioid use, nausea and vomiting cannot be explained by the reaction of a few but only by a considerable proportion of patients. This leads to a strong plea for a more careful treatment of unconscious patients in the emergency room, operating theater or intensive care unit, for the abandonment of the restriction of therapeutic communication to awake patients, and for new aspects of communication and hypnosis research. Obviously, loss of consciousness does not protect against psychological injury, and continuation of communication is needed. But how and what to talk to unconscious patients? Generally addressing the unconscious mind with suggestions that generally exert their effects unconsciously, hypnotic communication appears to be the adequate language. Especially addressing meaningful topics, as derived from the basic psychological needs and known stressors, appears essential. With respect to negative effects by negative or missing communication or to the proposed protective and supporting effects of therapeutic communication with patients clinically rated as unconscious, the role of consciousness is secondary. For the effects of perceived signals and suggestions it does not matter whether consciousness is absent, or partial, or unrecognized present.",

Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Insomnia (hyperarousal), parasomnias (partial arousal) and the sudden death syndrome of infancy are all attributed to disorders of arousal. It is concluded that diurnal hyperarousal leads to difficulty in getting off to sleep and staying asleep, whilst nocturnal arousal leads to excessive somnolence during the day, due to broken sleep during the night.",

In particular, sleep loss can trigger symptoms of mania or hypomania in certain bipolar patients [10]. Additionally, decreased sleep duration proved to be the best predictor of a manic state the following day in patients afflicted with rapid cycling bipolar disorder [6]. Since mania in turn causes insomnia, the development of mania is potentially self-reinforcing and could become autonomous after being initiated by precipitating factors [11]. Repeatedly, the importance of adequate treatment of sleep disturbance has been underscored over the centuries [4] [8].",

Because these disorders manifest themselves highly variably among children of any given age, and even in an individual affected child, they need an appropriate diagnostic evaluation so that the many environmental and background factors that may be relevant to the further course of the problem can be assessed.Extensive data were obtained on approximately 1400 children who were tested before beginning school in 2005 by means of a special sleep questionnaire and another screening instrument that is used to assess behavioral strengths and difficulties (the SDQ, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire).Five percent of the children were found to have difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or nocturnal awakening. Less frequent problems included parasomnias such as pavor nocturnus (0.5%), sleepwalking (0.1%), and frequent nightmares (1.7%).Sleep disorders increase the risk of daytime fatigue and of psychological problems in general, including both hyperactivity and excessive emotional stress. These results imply that sleep problems and emotional disturbances are intimately connected and underscore the importance of diagnosing sleep problems in young children.",

Hablaremos en primer lugar de algunos trastornos del movimiento relacionados con el sueño y frecuentes en la infancia. El mioclono nocturno benigno del lactante es motivo de consulta habitual en Pediatría. El síndrome de piernas inquietas, relacionado a menudo con los movimientos periódicos de piernas en el sueño, se asocian con frecuencia a ferropenia. Los movimientos rítmicos del sueño, que se realizan en la conciliación, no suelen requerir ningún tipo de intervención aunqueresultan muy llamativos para las familias.

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "title": "Sleep In The Medical Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Residual symptoms occur in many depressive patients after acute treatment [1]. There is growing evidence that residual symptoms are also prevalent in bipolar disorder during the euthymic phase and in unipolar depression, they are predictors of early relapse [2,3]. In long-term outcome, patients remitting from depression with residual symptoms, have more depressive symptoms and impaired social functioning, thus needing more aggressive treatment [4]. Residual symptoms might be conceived as the persistence of the original mood disorder, despite in a milder presentation, or still be in relation to the neurobiological disorder substrate. Residual symptoms include core mood and functional symptoms of depression. The most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and disinterest. The clinician should be aware that patients despite being in apparent remission should be questioned thoroughly in order to identify residual cognitive difficulties, impairment of work and activities, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbances or mild depressive mood [5]. The consequences of low-quality remission impairing psychosocial functioning have to be emphasized. In this presentation we will review the available evidence of the role played by the pharmacological treatments in the residual depressive symptoms.",

Charakter spanku se měni s narůstajicim věkem a při individualnim hodnoceni je někdy nesnadne vymezit, ktere problemy jsou přirozene a ktere již patologicke. Kvalitu spanku mohou zhorsovat faktory jako zarmutek, osamoceni, uzkost nebo změna prostředi. Staři lide maji obecně tendenci chodit dřive spat, ale dele usinat, v noci se casto probouzeji, rano dřive vstavaji a přes den i několikrat usinaji. Pro lepsi klasifikaci poruch spanku bylo v roce 1990 nově přepracovana verze Mezinarodni klasifikace poruch spanku (International Classification of slep Disorders {--} ICSD) ve spolupraci s různými asociacemi a spolecnostmi pro výzkum poruch spanku. Poruchy spanku se podle teto mezinarodni klasifikace děli na primarni poruchy kam zařezujeme dyssomnii a parasomnii a sekundarni poruchy, ktere jsou spojene s onemocněnim somatickým nebo dusevnim. Přiciny poruch spanku mohou být různe, a proto se diagnostika musi být pecliva. Sestra se zde take velkou casti zapojuje do diagnostiky. Při výzkumu bych chtěla zjistit, jake maji klienti v domovech důchodců poruchy spanku, jak jsou informovani o poruchach spanku a jestli maji klienti vhodne prostředi pro spanek. Hypoteza, že klienti v domovech důchodců trpi poruchu usinani se potvrdila. Hypoteza, že klienti v domovech důchodců jsou informovani o poruchach spanku se potvrdila, ale s malým rozdilem od varianty, že informace klienti o poruchach spanku nemaji. Hypoteza o neznalosti metod pro navozeni kvalitniho spanku se potvrdila. Hypoteza, že klienti v domově důchodců maji vhodne prostředi pro spanek se nepotvrdila. Sestra je zde velmi důležita, protože je vždy na blizku. Měla by se zajimat o problemy klientů se spankem a snažit se je řesit jinak než farmakologickou cestou. Sestry by měly být dostatecně informovane o těchto důležitých krocich, aby s těmito informacemi uměli zachazet a použivat je ve sve praxi. Spanek přece slouži k celkove regeneraci a nacerpani nových sil.",

      "abstract": "The intentional killing of oneself can be seen as evidence not only of personal breakdown, but also of a deterioration of the social context in which an individual lives. Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with upheavals in personal relationships, through alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-reported because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see Definition and comparability).",

      "abstract": "In modern society, more and more people work during ‘non-standard’ working hours, including shift and night work, which are recognized risk factors for health, safety and social well-being. Unfortunately, humans are physiologically unsuited to inverted schedules, leading to negative consequences for shift workers, employers, and society. The circadian and homeostatic processes which govern sleepiness and alertness are improperly aligned for night workers. Shiftwork, in particular night work, causes disruption of biological rhythms, perturbation of social and family life, with a negative influence on performance efficiency and health. Deterioration of health can manifest in the short-term as sleep disorders and accidents; in the long term there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal, psychoneurotic and cardiovascular diseases, and impairment of the female reproductive function. Night work and rotating shift work disrupt the circadian timing system. This disruption may produce significant deleterious symptoms ¡n some workers. Shift-work scheduling may aggravate certain medical conditions. Vulnerable individuals may develop clinical depression when working shifts.",

A lack of sleep, or sleep deprivation (SD), is a widespread phenomenon that can induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. This review focused on the biological explanation as well as the research investigating the numerous effects that SD can have on cognition. A reduction in sleep does not occur independently of the effects on memory, attention, alertness, judgment, decision-making, and overall cognitive abilities in the brain, resulting in decreased function and impaired cognitive performance.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that the increasing worldwide prevalence of chronic pain may be as high as 20-50 %. Furthermore, chronic pain is strongly associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and in particular, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Accordingly, pain is associated with decrements of many aspects of patient's lives including physical and emotional functioning, affective symptoms and sleep problems. The negative impact is higher in patients with greater pain severity. However, there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and these symptoms. Patients with somatisation, health-seeking behaviours and poor sleep are at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. The risk increases in tandem with severity of anxiety, depression or sleep problems, and those with multiple predisposing factors are at the highest risk (Figure 1)\nTherefore, clinically, it may be prudent to consider pain, sleep problems and anxiety/depression as co-existent components of a triad, where the presence of symptoms of one component should prompt investigation for the others.",

Pain, in its severer forms, as for example trigeminal neuralgia, migraine, or the various colics, is one of the heaviest crosses the human race has to bear. Usually pain is a danger signal or warning of some beginning disease process, trauma, or physiological upset. It also may be the hang-over effect of past disease processes. It can arise from purely psychic origin, which is perhaps the most difficult to alleviate.

      "abstract": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.",

      "title": "Disrupted Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Schizophrenia and Their Interaction With Dopamine Signaling",
      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is a common feature of schizophrenia, and is associated with symptom severity and patient quality of life. It is commonly manifested as disturbances to the sleep/wake cycle, with sleep abnormalities occurring in up to 80% of patients, making it one of the most common symptoms of this disorder. Severe circadian misalignment has also been reported, including non-24 h periods and phase advances and delays. In parallel, there are alterations to physiological circadian parameters such as body temperature and rhythmic hormone production. At the molecular level, alterations in the rhythmic expression of core clock genes indicate a dysfunctional circadian clock. Furthermore, genetic association studies have demonstrated that mutations in several clock genes are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia. Collectively, the evidence strongly suggests that sleep and circadian disruption is not only a symptom of schizophrenia but also plays an important causal role in this disorder. The alterations in dopamine signaling that occur in schizophrenia are likely to be central to this role. Dopamine is well-documented to be involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, in which it acts to promote wakefulness, such that elevated dopamine levels can disturb sleep. There is also evidence for the influence of dopamine on the circadian clock, such as through entrainment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and dopamine signaling itself is under circadian control. Therefore dopamine is closely linked with sleep and the circadian system; it appears that they have a complex, bidirectional relationship in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, such that disturbances to one exacerbate abnormalities in the other. This review will provide an overview of the evidence for a role of SCRD in schizophrenia, and examine the interplay of this with altered dopamine signaling. We will assess the evidence to suggest common underlying mechanisms in the regulation of sleep/circadian rhythms and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Improvements in sleep are associated with improvements in symptoms, along with quality of life measures such as cognitive ability and employability. Therefore the circadian system holds valuable potential as a new therapeutic target for this disorder.",

      "title": "Evaluación de funciones cognitivas: atención y memoria en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Evidence from recent studies about the epidemiology of panic disorder (PD) indicates that it is present in 4.7% of general population. In Mexico City, 2.9% of females and 1.9% of males are affected by this disease. Due to the incidence cited above, it is considered an important mental health problem that has impacted social, labor and familiar areas. On the other hand, PD is frequently present in comorbidity with other disorders like major depression, social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, in some cases, it may lead to a suicide risk. PD is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and is commonly associated with agoraphobia. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of fear or discomfort that includes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms comprise short breath, palpitations, sweating, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and chest pain. Cognitive symptoms are associated with catastrophic interpretation of bodily sensations; behavioral symptoms are mainly avoidant of different places, situations and actions that patient had associated with fear of loss of control. In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the neuropsychology of anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological evaluation is relevant because it implies an objective assessment of the cognitive and behavioral abilities and weaknesses that make possible the prediction of the course of the disorder and the effects of treatment modalities. One of the most important contributions of neuropsychological evaluation is the identification of stable patterns of cognitive profiles of a specific disorder considered as neurocognitive endophenotypes. Some recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuropsychological alterations and anxiety; nevertheless, most of them were observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. On the other hand, studies examining neuropsychological functioning in PD patients are scarce and report conflicting results. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether PD patients with and without agoraphobia, who attended the National Institute of Psychiatry «Ramon de la Fuente» in Mexico City, showed neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls in attention, memory and executive functions. We studied a total sample of 48 subjects (24 patients with PD, the patients sample was selected according to a psychiatric evaluation, based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Inclusion criteria were age between 19 and 56, men or women, without previous pharmacological or psychotherapeutically treatment; and 24 gender, age and education matched healthy control subjects). A neuropsychological test battery (Neuropsi Attention and Memory) in Spanish with norms by age and educational level was administered. The Neuropsi assesses orientation, attention and concentration, executive functions, working memory and immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory. Likewise, all patients were assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory and Panic Disorder Severity Scale. According to this psychometric evaluation, the PD patients showed severe anxiety, high anxiety sensitivity, as well as a severe degree of panic symptoms. The differences between PD patients and control subjects in neuropsychological performance were determined through one way analysis of variance (p<0.05) with the assistance of the SPSS 12. The results of the present study indicate that the neuropsychological test performance of patients with PD is diminished relative to that of the health control. According to obtained results, there were significant differences in the total score of executive functions and attention, memory and global attention and memory between patients and healthy controls. In the analysis of different subscales, it was found that patients had reduced performance in visual search, digit backward span, world list free recall, Rey-Ostereith Complex Figure Test encoding and retrieval, word list cued recall, faces retrieval and in diverse executive functions like category formation test, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, as well as design fluency. This suggests that PD is associated with alterations in tasks that require flexibility in the mental processes, short-term memory, working memory, and in the generation of strategies to solve problems. However, it is possible that these alterations were present before the onset of panic disorder and predispose the ulterior development of this disorder. In the visual detection subscale, that evaluates selective attention, there were also differences in latency of response because patients were slower than healthy controls trying to find the correct figure. This deficiency is associated with the difficulty of PD patients to perceive important details of the environment due to the extreme attention in the corporal sensations. Besides, no group differences were found in orientation, attention and concentration.",

The creation of a flashbulb memory depends on high level of 'surprise', a high level of 'consequentiality', and high level of 'arousal'. Flashbulb memories seem more accurate and stable than ordinary memories. Flashbacks are triggered by fatigue and certain moods states; and also by environmental cues assumedly related to the original situation suggesting the operation of a context-dependent retrieval mechanism. Victims of trauma often report 'anxious dreams' in which the traumatic event is relived in vivid multisensory images accompanied by the same intense emotions as those of the original event.",

      "abstract": "Nightmares are a prevalent mental disorder resulting in disturbed sleep, distress, and impairment in daily functioning. Elaborating on previous theoretical models for anxiety disorders, sleep disorders and dreaming, this study introduces a cognitive model of recurrent nightmares, the central element of which concerns representation of the nightmare’s repetitive storyline in the memory as a script. It is suggested that activation of this script during REM sleep results in a replay of the nightmare, and that activation occurs through perceived similarity between dream elements and the nightmare script. The model proposes a central role for cognitive processes in the persistence of nightmares over time. The success of cognitive-behavioural treatments is explained and clinical implications are discussed.",

We aimed to review the association between, and medical management of, narcolepsy and psychosis in children and adults.We reviewed the full text of 100 papers from 187 identified by a PubMed search on narcolepsy plus any of these keywords: psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion, side effects, safety, and bipolar disorder.Three relevant groups are described. (i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as \"not real\") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (\"the psychotic form of narcolepsy\") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders. We propose a clinical algorithm for the management of cases with psychotic-like or psychotic features.",

Self-disturbances in schizophrenia can be explained from the standpoint of an abnormal sense of agency, such as thought broadcasting as an over-attribution of agency and thought insertion as an under-attribution of agency. Delusional perception is often accompanied by impairment of perceptual organization; delusional mood and delusions might result from the reorganization of the fragmented perceptual field, as well as a loss of reality.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and complex motor behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep atonia loss (rapid eye movement sleep without atonia) during polysomnography. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

PTSD can also occur after the unexpected death of a family member or close friend, following a serious harm or threat of death or injury to a loved one, or in case of divorce or unemplyoement. It occurs in 1%-4% of the population. As neuroendocrine pattern, PTSD is characterized by abnormal low cortisol levels and higher than normal epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. In chronique forms a total decrease of the hippocampal volume, was found, region of the brain involved in processing memories and in the memorization process. Symptoms are grouped in three main categories: re-experiencing the event, accompanied by anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks; persistent avoidance of any reminders of the event, feeling detached or estranged from others; persistent anxiety and/or physical reactivity. As treatment, besides various psychotherapy techniques, various classes of psychotropic drugs are used, such as morphine, antipsychotics, usual or atypical antidepressants, anticonvulsants, to reduce anxiety, avoidance, nightmares and hyperexcitability.",

Studies find that psychological distress is common after disasters and can (under certain circumstances) extend for long periods of time after the disaster has occurred. Yet, most people are psychologically resilient even in the face of catastrophic events. This entry focuses on research into the impacts of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, volcanic eruptions, and floods. Disaster scholars argue that disasters are rooted in the social structure of societies; thus, impacts and responses to disasters vary by social group, circumstances, and community context. The most commonly observed psychological impacts of disasters in the literature are post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, with some attention to substance abuse. Some research has also examined physical impacts of stress after disaster, in particular myocardial infarction.",

      "abstract": "Importance Anxiety disorders have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 34% in the US, are often chronic, and significantly impair quality of life and functioning. Observations Anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that include worry, social and performance fears, unexpected and/or triggered panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behaviors. Generalized anxiety disorder (6.2% lifetime prevalence), social anxiety disorder (13% lifetime prevalence), and panic disorder (5.2% lifetime prevalence) with or without agoraphobia are common anxiety disorders seen in primary care. Anxiety disorders are associated with physical symptoms, such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Brief screening measures applied in primary care, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7, can aid in diagnosis of anxiety disorders (sensitivity, 57.6% to 93.9%; specificity, 61% to 97%). Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, eg, sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine extended release) remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.55 [95% CI, −0.64 to −0.46]; social anxiety disorder: SMD, −0.67 [95% CI, −0.76 to −0.58]; panic disorder: SMD, −0.30 [95% CI, −0.37 to −0.23]). Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 1.01 [large effect size] [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.57]; social anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 0.41 [small to medium effect] [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.57]; panic disorder: Hedges g = 0.39 [small to medium effect[ [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.65]), including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care. Conclusions and Relevance Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.",

However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

Approximately 4 percent of adult men and 2 percent of adult women are believed to have these conditions. In addition to having symptoms such as snoring, headaches, depression, decreased libido and fatigue, patients with sleep apnea are at risk for a range of severe complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep. Diagnosis may require an overnight polysomnogram in addition to the history, a physical examination and a laboratory assessment. Less cumbersome diagnostic modalities are being developed.

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

The list of possibilities spans virtually every major area of medicine, neurology and psychiatry. A clear, detailed history is invaluable in negotiating these numerous diagnostic considerations; however, the symptom may be expressed in terms that do not directly denote somnolence (e.g. `tiredness' or `fatigue'). Accurate diagnosis is important, not only because of the negative impacts of sleepiness and its root causes on health and social function, but because excessive sleepiness is generally remediable with appropriate treatment. As our understanding of the neurological underpinnings of alertness and sleepiness deepens, improved treatment methods are bound to emerge.",

      "abstract": "Sleep terrors are common, frightening, but fortunately benign events. Familiarity with this condition is important so that an accurate diagnosis can be made.To familiarize physicians with the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of children with sleep terrors.A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \"sleep terrors\" OR \"night terrors\". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article.It is estimated that sleep terrors occur in 1 to 6.5% of children 1 to 12 years of age. Sleep terrors typically occur in children between 4 and 12 years of age, with a peak between 5 and 7 years of age. The exact etiology is not known. Developmental, environmental, organic, psychological, and genetic factors have been identified as a potential cause of sleep terrors. Sleep terrors tend to occur within the first three hours of the major sleep episode, during arousal from stage three or four non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In a typical attack, the child awakens abruptly from sleep, sits upright in bed or jumps out of bed, screams in terror and intense fear, is panicky, and has a frightened expression. The child is confused and incoherent: verbalization is generally present but disorganized. Autonomic hyperactivity is manifested by tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushed face, dilated pupils, agitation, tremulousness, and increased muscle tone. The child is difficult to arouse and console and may express feelings of anxiety or doom. In the majority of cases, the patient does not awaken fully and settles back to quiet and deep sleep. There is retrograde amnesia for the attack the following morning. Attempts to interrupt a sleep terror episode should be avoided. As sleep deprivation can predispose to sleep terrors, it is important that the child has good sleep hygiene and an appropriate sleeping environment. Medical intervention is usually not necessary, but clonazepam may be considered on a short-term basis at bedtime if sleep terrors are frequent and severe or are associated with functional impairment, such as fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and distress. Anticipatory awakening, performed approximately half an hour before the child is most likely to experience a sleep terror episode, is often effective for the treatment of frequently occurring sleep terrors.Most children outgrow the disorder by late adolescence. In the majority of cases, there is no specific treatment other than reassurance and parental education. Underlying conditions, however, should be treated if possible and precipitating factors should be avoided.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in children and adults with NMD with an estimated prevalence exceeding 40%. Characteristics of NMD like progressive neuromuscular weakness of respiratory and diaphragmatic muscles, anatomic or neurologic propensity to upper airway obstruction during sleep, and/or cardiomyopathy contribute to the development of SDB. Prevalence and pattern of SDB vary with different types of NMD, depending on the features of the disease and the tempo of progression to respiratory muscle impairment. Importantly, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and nocturnal hypoventilation are often the first signs of respiratory muscle weakness in patients with NMD. The imbalance between respiratory capacity and respiratory loads usually first manifests during sleep, if not acutely during respiratory decompensation in respiratory infection. In patients with NMD, SDB typically first develops in rapid-eye-movement sleep when muscle atonia occurs, followed by continuous nocturnal hypoventilation through the night and eventually by progression into daytime respiratory failure. Untreated SDB and hypoventilation in NMD carries high respiratory morbidity and mortality. Therefore, screening for SDB and nocturnal hypoventilation is a vital part of long-term management of NMD and to detect patients at risk for respiratory failure. Anticipatory approach with regular assessment of symptoms, pulmonary function and sleep in children affected by NMD can aid early diagnosis and management of SDB. Timely provision of respiratory care and non-invasive ventilation are essential components of a multi-disciplinary care to improve quality of life and survival of patients with NMD.",

Enuresis is diagnosed when children repeatedly urinate in inappropriate places, such as clothing (during the day) or the bed (during the night). In most cases, the child’s urination problem is involuntary in nature, and is perceived by the child as an unavoidable loss of urinary control. This condition is most likely a symptom of psychological stress, although physiological causes, such as bladder infection, should not be ruled out. In general, the causes of bedwetting are related to anxiety, life stress, and possibly trauma, both inside and outside the home. Psychological factors such as a stressful life situation (death of a parent) or birth of a new sibling, disturbed family patterns, and delay toilet training, personality characteristics, parenting style, anxiety or presence of other emotional problems may predispose factors of enuresis. Many Children with enuresis experience significant distress or impairment in their social, academic, or everyday lives and the disorder can also drastically affect their families.

The phenomenon of paradoxical undressing may be observed. A paradoxical feeling of warmth in the advanced condition of hypothermia leads to the behaviour of undressing, partly or completely. Suicides with intentional hypothermia are rare. Fatal hypothermia often appears as a concomitant mechanism, e. g. in drug poisoning.

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Anxiety and Panic Disorders in Emergency Setting",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Anxiety disorders, primarily characterized by pathological anxiety, are very common in the general population with estimates ranging from 20 to 30 percent, and the lifetime prevalence rate is calculated at 16.6 percent.[1] It is to be noted that pathological anxiety is experienced as more intense and exaggerated which arises without any real threat. The word anxiety was taken from the Latin root \"anxieta\" meaning disturbance in the mind about an uncertain event, and the Greek root \"anxo\" meaning to squeeze, strangle, or press tight.[2] Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state that is associated with psychophysiological changes as a result of an intrapsychic conflict. Anxiety disorder is a disorder in which the most prominent disturbance is anxiety or in which patients experience anxiety when they refuse to give in to their symptoms.[3] Panic is an acute, intense attack of anxiety associated with disorganization in personality. It is characterized by overwhelming anxiety and feelings of impending doom. A panic attack is an acute intense anxiety episode, which occurs in panic disorder (PD), major depression, schizophrenia, and somatization disorder. PD is characterized by acute intense anxiety attacks in the presence or absence of agoraphobia.[3] The onset of panic symptoms is often spontaneous and rapid. Many patients seek help in an emergency department (ED) because of these characteristics, combined with its overwhelming intensity.[4] Anxiety-related complaints are commonly associated with alcohol and substance abuse, which further complicates the emergency physician's assessment.[5] PDs and exacerbations of previous acute stress symptoms are common patient presentations in the ED for primary anxiety disorders. Individuals with anxiety disorders may feel debilitated during an anxiety attack and feel embarrassed after the episode. To support the patient both during and after the anxiety episode, it is essential for ED clinicians to be aware of anxiety and PDs.[6]Table 1 outlines clinical predictors of anxiety caused by an underlying medical disorder.Table 1: Predictors of anxiety caused by an underlying medical issue[ 7 ]CLINICAL PRESENTATION In ED, anxiety presentations may be classified into four groups[5]: Primary psychiatric illness, such as generalized anxiety disorder Response to a stress or stressful event, such as acute stress disorder Medical conditions or substance abuse that mimic the symptoms of anxiety, such as hyperthyroidism Anxiety disorder comorbid with another physical or mental illness Six stages of development have been identified for PD, with stage 1 or stage 2 being the most common for patients. These stages are (1) limited symptom attack, (2) full panic attack, (3) hypochondriasis, (4) limited phobic avoidance, (5) extensive phobic avoidance, and (6) secondary depression. Stage progression is associated with increasing degrees of disability and corresponding treatment implications.[8] It is believed that the disorder is less likely to worsen if the diagnosis is made in stage 1 or 2 and treated.[9]Table 2 outlines various stages of PD.Table 2: Stages of panic disorder[ 10 ]The main distinguishing feature of PD is the combination of physical and cognitive symptoms. The onset is rapid, reaching its peak within 10 min and the attack around 1 h. The typical patient experiences 2–4 attacks per week, commonly accompanied by anticipatory anxiety.[11] Panic attack A brief period of intense fear or discomfort in which ≥4 of the following signs or symptoms occur abruptly and peak within 10 min[12]: Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate Sweating Trembling or shaking Sensation of shortness of breath or smothering Feeling of choking Chest pain or discomfort Nausea or abdominal distress Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself) Fear of losing control or going crazy Fear of dying Parasthesis (numbness or tingling sensations) Chills or hot flushes. Table 3 outlines the typical and atypical symptoms of panic attacks.Table 3: Typical and atypical symptoms of panic attacks[ 4 ]PD: Recurrent, sudden panic attacks that are followed by a minimum of 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack, worry about the potential implications or consequences of the attacks, or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.[11] Table 4 outlines the medical conditions that may cause anxiety.Table 4: Medical conditions that may cause anxiety[ 13 ]Management of the PD Assessment Patients with PD or anxiety usually present to the ED with somatic symptoms of breathlessness, palpitations, chest pain, etc. It is not uncommon for them to be diagnosed as having an acute respiratory or cardiac event or any other physical illness. Even though the patient is having a panic attack, it is highly essential to rule out all acute physical emergencies. A proper history taking along with a careful physical examination of the vital parameters and certain basic investigations help the emergency physician to rule out a physical illness. These include the measurement of vital data like blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulse rate and characteristics, and respiratory rate. Hematological investigations like complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, blood glucose levels, arterial blood gas analysis, thyroid function tests, and renal function tests are to be done. Electrolyte abnormalities like reduced ionized calcium and serum phosphate levels are usually seen in patients with hyperventilation. An electrocardiogram to rule out any acute cardiac abnormalities can be done. Point of care ultrasonography of the lungs, bedside X-ray of the chest, and peak flowmetry to rule out any respiratory abnormalities are advisable. A toxicological screening to rule out any drug abuse is also helpful in an emergency setting. After ruling out the possible physical causes, the patient could be diagnosed with a PD or an anxiety disorder. Application of DSM-V or ICD-10 guidelines in an emergency setting could be difficult due to the unavailability of a psychiatrist in the ED. This could lead to underdiagnosing or misdiagnosing the PD. Hence, using certain screening tools that can be applied by an emergency physician or any general physician could be useful in diagnosing a patient with panic or anxiety disorders. Screening tools Following are some of the available screening tools that can be used by physicians or primary care doctors in an emergency setting [Table 5]:Table 5: Screening tools for anxiety/panic disorderTreatment in an emergency setting After careful history taking and a careful assessment, patients can be diagnosed with a physical illness or with anxiety or PD. If the patient is found to have a physical illness, he or she can be treated by the emergency physician immediately and later referred to the concerned specialist physician. If the patient is found to have a psychogenic panic attack or an anxiety disorder, he can be treated by the emergency physician to subvert the crisis situation and then referred to a psychiatrist. However, it is not uncommon for patients diagnosed with primary mental illness to have an underlying medical condition, and should be taken into consideration while treating the patient. Patients can be treated using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures. Pharmacotherapy The most important step in the management is to abort the panic attack. A benzodiazepine with rapid onset of action is the choice of pharmacotherapy. Alprazolam, lorazepam, and clonazepam are used to treat anxiety/panic symptoms. Alprazolam is usually started at a low dose of 0.25 mg, three times a day, but doses of 4 mg/day or more may be required.[23] The initial starting dose of lorazepam is 2 mg to 3 mg, can repeat the dose 2 to 3 times per day; the maximum dosage is 10 mg per day.[24] It can also be administered via intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection (2 mg/mL solution, and 4 mg/mL solution). The onset of its action is 1 to 3 min if administered IV and 15 to 30 min if administered IM. Clonazepam is given orally at a starting dose of 0.25 mg and can be used with a maximum dose of 4 mg/day. Abrupt cessation of the benzodiazepines might lead to withdrawal and hence careful tapering of the medication must be done. Caution must be taken with the use of long-term benzodiazepines because of the dependence potential. In the long-term treatment of anxiety/PD, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medications. Examples of SSRIs approved by the FDA to treat the PD include escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluoxetine. Even though all of them are equally effective, because of their sedating property, paroxetine is more commonly used.[25] These medications must be titrated slowly and take several weeks to be effective. Common side effects of SSRIs include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, headache, tremors, agitation, dizziness, sweating, and sexual dysfunction. Tricyclic antidepressants include imipramine, clomipramine, etc. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like venlafaxine are also used in the treatment of PD. A brief course of alprazolam can be prescribed in conjunction with an SSRI for short-term management of PD and should be slowly titrated when the therapeutic actions of the SSRI become apparent (2–4 weeks). Medications and their dosages used in PD are summarized in Table 6.Table 6: Medications used in anxiety/panic disorderNon-pharmacological therapy Most panic attacks spontaneously resolve within half an hour, and patients can sometimes present with the attacks subsiding or with feelings of anticipatory anxiety. Therefore, during such an attack, the treating physician should reassure the patient and explain the brief nature of the illness. Psychoeducation of the patient and the caregivers regarding the course and prognosis of the illness helps in alleviating the anxiety. For further information on psychoeducation in the management of anxiety, refer to Clinical Practice Guidelines for Psychoeducation in Psychiatric Disorders General Principles of Psychoeducation.[26] In the long term, psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy,[27] interpersonal therapy, and mindfulness therapy can be used to treat PD, but also take effect after several weeks. Therefore, healthcare providers in the ED should properly refer and educate on general lifestyle recommendations to reduce and identify any anxiety-related symptoms, such as eliminating stimulants, obtaining adequate sleep, and exercising daily. In addition, relaxation techniques[17] can easily be administered in ED settings and have the potential to reduce anxiety. Deep breathing exercises,[28] which involve consciously slowing respirations and focusing on taking regular slow deep breaths have been shown to reduce anxiety or panic symptoms. Another strategy may include guided imagery,[29] where the emergency physician encourages the patient to imagine a serene location free of stress. Both of these methods may have a profound effect on the anxiety of patients who present with a panic attack or known PD. Role of emergency physicians PD is a very common presentation in the primary care setting, especially in an ED. Most of the patients have cardiac, gastrointestinal, ear, nose, and throat (ENT), or neurological comorbidities. As the first point of contact with the patients, emergency physicians have an important role in the management of PDs. A holistic history and clinical assessment are of paramount importance. Early recognition and management help to reduce both morbidity and mortality. The emergency physician should be able to abate the panic attack and put in a referral to a psychiatrist especially if the patient has suicidality or any self-neglect or inadequate response to the primary intervention. Early referral decreases overall cost in the assessment and management of PDs.[30] The management of patients presenting to the emergency department has been summarized in Figure 1.Figure 1: Algorithm depicting the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with anxiety/panic symptomsSUMMARY Anxiety/PD is common in the general population and often presents to the ED. The emergency physician must be able to identify the underlying cause for the presentation, which could be either a primary mental illness or an underlying medical condition presenting with the symptoms of anxiety/PD to initiate proper treatment. Basic investigations help in the assessment of the symptoms. If the cause is an underlying medical illness, referral to the concerned specialist would be helpful and if symptoms are purely due to a primary mental illness, the patient can be screened for an anxiety or PD. Early and timely recognition of primary anxiety disorder helps in avoiding unnecessary investigations and can be treated with both pharmacological and non-pharmacological options. The main aim is to calm down the patient and abort the panic attack. Benzodiazepines and SSRIs remain the mainstay of treatment. Reassurance and psychoeducation of the patient as well as his caregivers help a long way in the management of the symptoms. Judicious use of medication, patient education, and referral to a physician whenever necessary improve the outcome of patients with this otherwise potentially disabling disorder.

      "title": "Low-Dose Clozapine for an Adolescent with TBI-Related Fregoli Delusions",
      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities. Had a history of MVA, 10 months ago, incurred severe TBI, admitt ed to ICU, discharged on prophylactic Valproate 1000 mg/d for posttraumatic seizures. He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment. He was seen by a private psychiatrist, a diagnosis of psychotic depression was entertained, and fluoxetine (Prozac",

      "title": "Sleepwalking, sleep terrors, sexsomnia and other disorders of arousal: the old and the new",
      "abstract": "Summary Disorders of arousal (DOA) is an umbrella term initially covering classical sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals, and now including a wider spectrum of specialised forms of non rapid eye movement (non REM) parasomnias such as sexsomnia, sleep‐related eating disorder, and sleep‐related choking syndrome. Growing evidence has shown that DOA are not restricted to children but are also prevalent in adults (2%–4% of the adult population). While DOA run in family, genetics studies remain scarce and inconclusive. In addition to the risk of injury on themselves and others (including sexual assaults in sexsomnia), adults with DOA frequently suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness, pain, and altered quality of life. The widespread view of DOA as automatic and amnesiac behaviours has now been challenged by subjective (dream reports) and objective (dream‐enacting behaviours documented on video‐polysomnography) observations, suggesting that sleepwalkers are ‘dream walking’ during their episodes. Behavioural, experiential, cognitive, and brain (scalp electroencephalography [EEG], stereo‐EEG, high density‐EEG, functional brain imaging) data converge in showing a dissociated pattern during the episodes. This dissociated pattern resembles the new concept of local arousal with a wake‐like activation in motor and limbic regions and a preserved (or even increased) sleep intensity over a frontoparietal network. EEG and behavioural criteria supporting the DOA diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity are now available. However, treatment is still based on controlling priming and precipitating factors, as well as on clinicians’ personal experience with sedative drugs. Placebo‐controlled trials are needed to improve patients’ treatment. DOA deserve more attention from sleep researchers and clinicians.",

It often produces misleading complaints that include alterations of consciousness, inexplicable sensory and motor sensations, and it is often masked by coexisting somatic symptoms. Confounding the confusion, patients are often unaware of excessive breathing, and subjective “dizziness” is often the presenting complaint, which may lead to syncopal episodes. Obscuring recognition further, symptoms attributed to the panic disorder often overlap with those of hyperventilation. Proper diagnosis of hyperventilation is described by the simple bedside maneuver of forced breathing. This diagnosis must be considered before effective management can occur.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a form of periodic breathing during sleep, is the most common cause of respiratory failure during sleep. It causes a relative lack of breathing and sleeping that bodes disaster for the patient. Alternately breathing and not breathing, the afflicted sleeper struggles to inspire through an obstructed upper airway or, more correctly, an occluded oropharynx. He repeatedly experiences episodic hypoxemia, which, in turn, disrupts his sleep. (This use of the male pronoun is convenient and correct, statistically; OSA is rare in women.) Obstructive sleep apnea is a multisystem disorder involving metabolic, respiratory, and neural abnormalities. The cause of the airway obstruction is multifaceted and includes the following: structural encroachment on the oropharyngeal lumen, subatmospheric intrapharyngeal pressure, and hypotonicity of oropharyngeal muscles. Similarly, secondary disease manifestations appear in multiple systems; respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and hypersomnolence are characteristic of severe OSA, and this complex is usually referred to",

      "title": "Improving management of ARDS: uniting acute management and long-term recovery",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an important global health issue with high in-hospital mortality. Importantly, the impact of ARDS extends beyond the acute phase, with increased mortality and disability for months to years after hospitalization. These findings underscore the importance of extended follow-up to assess and address the Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS), characterized by persistent impairments in physical, cognitive, and/or mental health status that impair quality of life over the long-term. Persistent muscle weakness is a common physical problem for ARDS survivors, affecting mobility and activities of daily living. Critical illness and related interventions, including prolonged bed rest and overuse of sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents during mechanical ventilation, are important risk factors for ICU-acquired weakness. Deep sedation also increases the risk of delirium in the ICU, and long-term cognitive impairment. Corticosteroids also may be used during management of ARDS, particularly in the setting of COVID-19. Corticosteroids can be associated with myopathy and muscle weakness, as well as prolonged delirium that increases the risk of long-term cognitive impairment. The optimal duration and dosage of corticosteroids remain uncertain, and there's limited long-term data on their effects on muscle weakness and cognition in ARDS survivors. In addition to physical and cognitive issues, mental health challenges, such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, are common in ARDS survivors. Strategies to address these complications emphasize the need for consistent implementation of the evidence-based ABCDEF bundle, which includes daily management of analgesia in concert with early cessation of sedatives, avoidance of benzodiazepines, daily delirium monitoring and management, early mobilization, and incorporation of family at the bedside. In conclusion, ARDS is a complex global health challenge with consequences extending beyond the acute phase. Understanding the links between critical care management and long-term consequences is vital for developing effective therapeutic strategies and improving the quality of life for ARDS survivors.",

      "title": "Sleep Physiology, Circadian Rhythms, Waking Performance and the Development of Sleep-Wake Therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are highly prevalent and diverse. The aetiology of some sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, is understood at the conceptual level of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and in part at a mechanistic level. Other disorders such as insomnia are more difficult to relate to sleep regulatory mechanisms or sleep physiology. To further our understanding of sleep-wake disorders and the potential of novel therapeutics, we discuss recent findings on the neurobiology of sleep regulation and circadian rhythmicity and its relation with the subjective experience of sleep and the quality of wakefulness. Sleep continuity and to some extent REM sleep emerge as determinants of subjective sleep quality and waking performance. The effects of insufficient sleep primarily concern subjective and objective sleepiness as well as vigilant attention, whereas performance on higher cognitive functions appears to be better preserved albeit at the cost of increased effort. We discuss age-related, sex and other trait-like differences in sleep physiology and sleep need and compare the effects of existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep- and wake-promoting treatments. Successful non-pharmacological approaches such as sleep restriction for insomnia and light and melatonin treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders target processes such as sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Most pharmacological treatments of sleep disorders target specific signalling pathways with no well-established role in either sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Pharmacological sleep therapeutics induce changes in sleep structure and the sleep EEG which are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. Sleep- and wake-promoting therapeutics often induce residual effects on waking performance and sleep, respectively. The need for novel therapeutic approaches continues not at least because of the societal demand to sleep and be awake out of synchrony with the natural light-dark cycle, the high prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances in mental health disorders and in neurodegeneration. Novel approaches, which will provide a more comprehensive description of sleep and allow for large-scale sleep and circadian physiology studies in the home environment, hold promise for continued improvement of therapeutics for disturbances of sleep, circadian rhythms and waking performance.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders fall mainly into the category of neurotic, stress, or somatoform disorders, as defined by the inter­national classification of disease system (ICD- 11, WHO, 2018). They refer to several disorders that include gener­alized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobic anxiety disorders, panic disorder (± agoraphobia), obsessive compul­sive disorder (OCD) and post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Collectively, anxiety disorders affect almost 30% of people in the western world during their lifetime, with PTSD and GAD amongst the most prevalent. In general, anxiety disorders are associated with neurotransmitter dysregulation and amygdala hyperactivity. Insomnia is the unsatisfactory quantity and/ or quality of sleep, which persists for sufficient time to affect quality of life. It is often associated with other mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, alcohol dependence) and physical (e.g. pain, neoplasms) pathologies, or iatrogenic effects (e.g. diuretic, β- blockers, statins, levodopa). It may require treatment if symptoms are troublesome. Chronic insomnia can last for years, and affects almost 10% of the popula­tion. Around 30% have symptoms that are occasionally worse, with higher prevalence in older age. Many factors interplay to generate a state of anxiety, but from a biological perspective one of the key central brain pathways involved in this process is the limbic system, which regulates an array of functions, including emo­tion, fear, behaviour, and memory. One vital brain area that processes fear reactions from the thalamus and cortex is the amygdala, with connections to the hypothal­amus, which can activate sympathetic reactions and the hypothalamic– pituitary axis (HPA). Activation/ inhibition within this pathway leads to altered neurotransmitter activity. Corticotrophin- releasing factor (CRF) is known to be released from the hypothalamus in response to stress, under the regulation of the amygdala. CRF acts to drive the HPA, promoting the release of ACTH from the pituitary and then cortisol from the adrenal gland. In effect, sus­tained CRF exposure may lead to limbic system up- regu­lation and the heightening of anxiety states. Moreover, dysregulation in this system and changes in central cor­tisol sensing systems (e.g. decreased receptor expression) may cause chronic anxiety. The locus coeruleus (LC), is another brain region partly responsible for regulating the sympathetic effects of stress, again under the control of CRF.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

      "abstract": "Despite intensive research over the past decades, the mechanisms which lead to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) still remain elusive. SIDS is presumed to occur in an apparently healthy infant during a period of sleep (1). A failure of cardiorespiratory control mechanisms, together with an impaired arousal from sleep response, are believed to play an important role in the final event of SIDS. Sleep has a marked influence on respiratory and cardiovascular control in both adults and infants, although sleep states, sleep architecture, and arousal from sleep processes in infants are very different from those of adults and undergo significant maturation during the first year of life, particularly in the first six months when SIDS risk is greatest (2).Arousal from sleep involves both physiological and behavioral responses and has long been considered a vital survival response for restoring homeostasis in reaction to various life-threatening situations, such as prolonged hypoxia or hypotension (3). There are two distinct arousal types defined in infants, subcortical activation and full cortical arousal, which reflect the hierarchical activation from the brainstem (including heart rate, blood pressure, and ventilation changes) to the cortex (4). Any impairment of these protective responses may render an infant vulnerable to the respiratory and cardiovascular instabilities that are common during infancy and that have been postulated to occur in SIDS. In support of this possibility, extensive physiological and neuropathological studies have provided compelling evidence that impaired cardiovascular control, with a concomitant failure to arouse from sleep, are involved in the final events leading to SIDS. The first six months of life are a critical period of development when rapid maturation of the brain, cardiorespiratory system, and sleep state organization are all taking place (2, 5). Thus, the investigation of sleep physiology in healthy infants during this high-risk period provides important insights into the likely mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of SIDS.",

      "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), characterises illness anxiety disorder (IAD) as the preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness in the absence of somatic symptoms (or, if present, symptoms that are only mild in severity). DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

      "abstract": "Decrease in cognitive capacity after anesthesia has been admired by the medical profession and public for a long time. It is a settled process after cardiopulmonary surgery and late research uncovers it to be a shockingly common result after different sorts of real surgery. Much stays obscure about its etiology; however the suggestions for anesthesia and surgery in an undeniably seemingly perpetual populace are extensive. Clinically, cognitive dysfunction can be characterized as debilitation of cognitive dysfunctions, including memory, learning, focus, and speed of mental action. Influencing surgical patients in all age bunches over the short term, cognitive dysfunction shows days or weeks after surgery and shows quicker determination in more youthful populations, in spite of the fact that it might be perpetual. Generally, communicated by patients as another powerlessness to finish once effectively feasible tasks, signs include trouble staying concentrated on an errand, failure to multitask, trouble discovering words and reviewing information recently obtained. In more extreme cases, post-operative cognitive dysfunction can bring about a calamitous loss of cognitive capacity, with related expanded mortality, danger of rashly leaving work, and reliance on social welfare.",

These disorders arise at the intersection of lesion-related brain dysfunction and psychological distress related to the event and its aftermath, making it difficult to identify what symptom is a direct physiological consequence of the stroke. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, emotionalism, and anger are the most common of these syndromes, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to the stroke event has become increasingly recognized as a relevant entity. Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized. Early identification and treatment may mitigate functional impairment and improve quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines from the general population are often relied upon to guide treatment. Further research is needed to understand and tailor treatment of these disorders in the poststroke population.",

      "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in our understanding of narcolepsy, the disease continues to cause the sufferer severe negative life effects. Before and after diagnosis, narcoleptics often experience unrelenting severe psychosocial stress. Child and adolescent narcoleptics report embarrassment, academic decline and feelings of loss of self-worth related to the symptoms of their disease. Personality characteristics may be adapted in order to avoid social situations that would precipitate cataplexy or draw attention to the patient's degree of somnolence. Misdiagnosis of these illnesses may result in inappropriate treatment and underestimation of an individual's potential. Adult narcoleptics also face the concerns of the workplace. Worry about loss of job and income are a source of anxiety and are often based in reality. Accidents at home, while driving and in the workplace are increased, creating safety concerns for both the patient and the community. Marital difficulties are common and psychopathology is known to occur more frequently. Narcolepsy's marked impact on quality of life has been found to be similar across cultural lines and these effects appear to be an inherent part of the disease. The socioeconomic impact in general is even more severe than those of comparable forms of epilepsy. Successful diagnosis and treatment do not end the narcoleptic's difficulties. The need for stimulants often creates problems with pharmacists and family. Somnolence, which responds the most poorly of all narcoleptic symptoms, leads to continued problems in the workplace. Side effects related to stimulant use may be a further source of difficulty. Finally, families may be unwilling to accept the illness and thereby alienate the patient. Education of the public, including physicians, pharmacists and family, will be necessary to improve this situation. Participation of informed professionals at the individual and group levels will be necessary to impart positive change in the narcoleptic's psychosocial well-being.",

      "title": "Fatigue and sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: A role for light therapy?",
      "abstract": "Fatigue and sleep disturbances are common and disabling symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI). They occur chronically, and impact significantly on the ability of individuals with these injuries to return to pre-injury function, as well as overall quality of life. The aetiology of these symptoms appears to be complex and most likely multifactorial in nature, involving the primary effects of mechanical neuronal injury, but also secondary factors such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive disturbance (particularly in the domain of attention). In the context of unclear aetiology, current understandings of fatigue and sleep disturbances have primarily relied on patient self-report, particularly for fatigue which is inherently a subjective complaint, but also for sleep disturbances. Identification of suitable objective measures for fatigue and sleep or their associated symptoms may assist in further understanding these complaints. Related to the limited understanding of these complaints following TBI, is the lack of well established treatment regimens. In theory, an optimal treatment of fatigue and sleep disturbance following TBI would involve focus on the symptoms themselves as well as their associated factors, such as depression and impaired attention. Recent research in the field of sleep and chronobiology, particularly research investigating the therapeutic applications of light exposure, suggests that light therapy may offer an efficacious modality for treatment of fatigue, sleep disturbance and associated symptoms in the TBI population. \n\nThe aims of the current thesis were to: (1) assess the utility of objective assessment tools in order to aid further understanding of disturbances to sleep-wakefulness and sustained attention (i.e. psychomotor vigilance) performances following TBI; and (2) investigate in a randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of blue light therapy, in the treatment of fatigue and its related symptoms in patients with TBI. This was achieved across three separate studies. \n\nSpecifically, study one investigated the utility of actigraphy as an objective measure of sleep following TBI. The findings of the study revealed significant associations between actigraphic and self-reported (diary) estimates of nocturnal total sleep time (TST) and daily TST in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls. While stronger associations between diary and actigraphy were observed in the control group, the magnitude of these associations did not differ significantly between groups. The study thus provided preliminary support for use of actigraphy as an objective assessment of sleep duration in the TBI population. \n\nIn light of previous research that has demonstrated associations between vigilance/sustained attention and both fatigue and sleep disturbances in patients with TBI, study two compared psychomotor vigilance performance in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). The PVT was selected as a potentially useful objective measure in patients with TBI as it has been commonly used within the sleep science field and is well accepted for its sensitivity to sleep loss, circadian timing, and countermeasures for sleepiness. Consistent with past research, study two demonstrated that patients with TBI showed slower performances and increased attentional lapses relative to healthy controls. Distribution analyses additionally revealed that patients with TBI performed more slowly across the entire performance distribution, consistent with a generalised cognitive slowing. Depression, fatigue and daytime sleepiness were found to have varying impacts on aspects of psychomotor vigilance performance. Previous use of the PVT in TBI groups has been limited and the study highlighted the sensitivity of the PVT to sustained attention deficits in patients with TBI. \n\nTaken together, the findings of study one and two have implications for the ongoing assessment of sleep and performance deficits in patients with TBI, and have potential to provide greater understanding of fatigue and sleep complaints in this population. \n\nFinally, given the lack of efficacious treatments for fatigue and sleep disturbances following TBI, study three examined the efficacy of blue light therapy as a potential treatment of fatigue and its associated symptoms in patients with TBI. Blue light therapy was selected for use given prior research findings which have demonstrated its alerting, circadian phase shifting, and mood enhancing properties. In a sample of patients with TBI who had self-reported fatigue and sleep complaints, study three demonstrated the efficacy of daily, morning exposure (45 minutes) to blue light over a 4 week treatment period in alleviation of self-reported fatigue and daytime sleepiness. This is the first demonstration of efficacy for a non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue and daytime sleepiness in patients with TBI. These findings establish the basis for large-scale randomised controlled trials of light therapy for fatigue in TBI, and have important implications for enhancing rehabilitation participation and long-term quality of life following TBI.",

The consequences include depressed mood, interpersonal irritability, decreased daytime vigilance, weight gain, coronary artery disease, and cognitive impairment (Kecklund and Axelsson 2016). Determining what amount of sleep is sufficient for an individual is difficult for several reasons. Sleep duration gradually decreases from a starting length of 16 hours per 24-hour day as human beings transition from infancy to adulthood. Interindividual differences in the optimal amount of sleep range from 6 to 12 hours, with a mean of 7.5 hours for adults. When a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSAH), is present, the continuity and depth of sleep may be compromised independently of sleep duration. Recognizing how much sleep any individual requires is complicated. Nonetheless, there is consensus that chronically inadequate sleep is detrimental to health.",

Admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with acute disease carries a high level of stress for families, as the disease is of sudden onset and is life-threatening. The incidence of PTSD (21%) was significant among parents well after their child was discharged from the PICU. Symptoms of PTSD include reexperiencing the traumatic event through recurrent, intrusive recollections, repetitive play, or distressing dreams; avoidance of associations with the event through restricted affect and feelings of detachment; and hyperarousal symptoms such as sleep difficulties, poor concentration, irritability, aggression, and physiological reactivity to trauma-related events. In addition to general hyperarousal symptoms, children may complain of stomachaches and headaches. There have been many summaries and reviews of research published regarding the effects of hospitalization with these children. Findings indicate that the experience is, indeed, stressful and that children may experience fear phenomena, regression, sadness, separation anxiety, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, and aggressive behaviors. There was a positive correlation between PTSD symptoms in parents and PTSD symptoms in the child, length of admission and perceived threat of illness to the child’s life. In PICU admissions cause greater disruption to a child’s life, with longer admissions, greater time off school and more paediatric out-patient contacts and hospital re-admissions in the 6–12 months after discharge.",

      "title": "Anxiety",
      "abstract": "It is difficult to overstate just how important anxiety is to an understanding of all of mental health, but especially the mental health of children. What the process of inflammation is to pathophysiology and pathology, anxiety is to paediatric psychiatry. It is so persistently omnipresent that it is taken for granted, assigned to the ‘human condition’ and ignored as a character flaw, or a concomitant of an overprotected childhood. Of course it is part of being human. Its non-pathological variants are more common in childhood. Anxiety is made worse by overprotection and, just as inflammation is a normal process that serves a vital day-to-day function, so too does anxiety. However, those children who come into life with a ‘psychological atopy’ in which their threat detection system (worry, fear and anxiety) is switched to ‘incoming missiles’ without much opportunity of finer modulation have a long-term vulnerability to many different mental health problems. Worry becomes rumination, overflows into agitation, leads to depressive exhaustion and, in the most extreme, paranoia and desire for relief from the torment of the ubiquitous sense of danger. Genes for obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety, eating disorders, somatoform disorders and environments of chronic uncertainty and trauma will play out like musical notes on the basic physiological stave of anxiety. The accompanying paper by Ron Rapee says, in a very understated and modest way, what he and others have come to know after decades of patient work.1 He is one of the world's leading researchers on childhood anxiety, particularly anxiety at that end of the anxiety spectrum that people like me so often neglect: the non-pathological end that blurs into the normal experience of childhood. He has been looking at ‘catching anxiety early’ instead of leaving it until it is an established, entrenched condition in adolescence when cooperation wanes, avoidance of treatment is maximal and alcohol and other substances are readily available to offer relief.2 Most current services are geared towards the part of the spectrum of anxiety most difficult to treat. Anxiety predisposes to most major mental illness, emerges more intensely in their presage, forms a fundamental feature of their phenotype and remains as a disabling residuum throughout the recovery process. The long-term management of mentally ill children and young people is the dismantling of the threat and avoidance that characterise those who have been traumatised by the process of being mentally itself. I remember the elaborate discussions as to why neonates having cardiac surgery did not require pain relief. I imagine some colleagues will feel the same way about pre-school anxiety. Helen Egger, Clinical Director of the Duke Preschool Psychiatric Clinic, has in the last decade extended some of this work Ron has pioneered.3-6 Her Clinic at Duke University conducts comprehensive evaluations and provides treatment for children aged 2–5 years and their families, much as we would now offer early intervention for autistic children. Her current research uses functional detailed personal and family histories, genetic, physiological and neuroimaging to examine dysfunctions of the neural circuitry in children with early onset anxiety disorders.3-6 She is leading the development of an early childhood neuroimaging programme within the Center for Developmental Epidemiology and Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC) at Duke. Using very rigorous criteria they have established that the physiology of anxiety is present from age 3 and has continuity into childhood and adolescence. Their longitudinal studies have not reached adulthood yet. As Ron Rapee's article highlights,1 anxiety disorders are deeply heritable and have strong continuity. Philip Zombardo from Stanford University has tried to capture some of this in his work in the book ‘The Shy Child’.7 Of course it is now clear that the absence of normal anxiety may be very maladaptive with a clear need for threat detection in even the most seemingly safe environments. This is likely a contributor to the strong conservation of anxious traits in the normal population. Those parts of the brain most often implicated in anxiety disorders (amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the hypothalamus) have a long phylogenetic history back to the reptiles. Some would have preferred that Ron took more time on parental and peer interactions. However, as Ron is only too aware, there are many surprises here in the literature. Anxious parents share genes with anxious children, anxious children can make parents anxious and anxious peers can form friendships because they pose less threat. The directionality of effect is not nearly as straightforward as the common myths about anxiety suggest, especially at the more normal end of the spectrum. Hospital clinic samples of parent–child interactions can be very misleading. Despite the strong heritability, continuity over time and adaptive nature of some anxiety, it is strangely treatable when caught very early. This most human aspect of the human condition may not be, and probably should not be, eliminated altogether. However, it can be modified like inflammation, to more acceptable levels. Psychological treatments have demonstrated good efficacy with around two-thirds of patients responding to treatment. However, treatment itself can be interpreted as a threat, and for this reason young people with anxiety disorders are among the least likely to seek appropriate help. Their families also can be fearful of treatments unless the parents are able to supervise them closely, which does not endear them to their treating clinician. Paediatricians are in a unique position to identify anxious children and young people when they present with fears related to medical disorder. Paediatricians are also able to reassure that seeking help is not a failure on their part, and capable, known and well-trained psychologists do not pose a threat. They are able to educate families and recommend appropriate intervention after basic advice is found to be insufficient. Every community paediatric practice would benefit from having a clinical child psychologist who could work in collaboration without any fear that they would run short of work. I expect in the future child development units will offer shy child and worried children clinics in the same way they currently offer clinics for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disorders and autistic spectrum disorders. Only by offering these early interventions can we expect to reduce the majority of adolescent depression, social anxiety, substance abuse and risk taking behaviour. There will be a group that do not respond to these treatments and will require more intensive therapy, probably by child psychiatrists. However, most early, mild to moderate anxiety disorders can be dealt with, and should be dealt with, by paediatricians and clinical child psychologists in partnership. This paper by Ron Rapee in this issue of the journal starts that process by which paediatricians take emotional disability as seriously as learning disability.1 How paediatricians gain the training and experience to do this will require future papers like Ron Rapee's.",

Data Sources: Revision of the relevant medical literature, research in “MEDLINE” for the period between 1976 and 2004. Textbook chapters were also consulted. Summary: The sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a breathing disorder during the sleep characterized by partial prolonged obstruction of the upper airway and/or intermittent complete obstruction, which interrupts the normal breathing ventilation and sleep standards. The difficulties of gas exchange occurring during sleep constitute a spectrum of diseases which varies, in increasing severity, from primary snoring to sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome with severe complications and death risk. Conclusions: During the pediatric routine clinic visit, an item of the anamnesis that should be always present is whether the child snores during the night; in case a history of snoring is found, a more detailed anamnesis, mainly with regard to the existence of signs and/or symptoms of difficult breathing, must be carried out.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

      "abstract": "In addition to accidental crisis, we are often talking in the modern world about development crisis. The terms like period, or time, even years of crisis are mostly used in the milieu of our country, because our people were exposed to contemporary or successive critical situations. This increases the general tendency to mental disorders and causes many pathological phenomena, with suicide among them as the most serious. In our society suicide is treated as well as a product of illness or seismograph of sociable impact, because there is high unemployment, privation, high percent of divorce and social isolation. Nevertheless, the same occurs in other developmental states, were benefit of civilization, wrongly directed, can dehumanize and alienate and lead to suicidal tendencies. Although, the risk of suicide is 3-12 times higher among psychiatric patients, the greatest number of those who commit suicide have never met a psychiatrist. Furthermore, when in the presence of mental illness, the patient consciously chooses death, great stigma and mystery remains attached to the psychiatrist himself. Psychiatrists are sometimes placed between, on the one side, some statistical reports or simplified approaches, which very clearly claim to know the causes of and, on the other side, knowledge about the role of the unconscious in in formulation of not why someone committed suicide, butwhat does he wanted to reach? Psychiatric experience is that there will be 5 patient's suicides within a psychiatrist's life span. We are afraid this figure will be exceeded today, in a time of crisis, endangering the psychiatrist himself. The Psychiatrist should not stay alone in his treatment of suicidal patient. He needs a great support of society, just like his patient does. Only by working together, will we feel that we are doing something not with, but for someone who wants to commit suicide.

The actions are generally closer in nature to addictive disorders, being ego syntonic, and less like true impulsive disorders which patients may try to resist [1]. Punding represents a need to perform senseless activities repeatedly, such as folding and refolding clothes in a drawer for hours at a time, polishing pennies, or pulling weeds from a lawn or threads from a rug. The more common ICDs include gambling disorder, compulsive sexual disorder, consumerism, and hobbyism, but may include strikingly unusual activities that are extraordinarily narrow in their focus. The DDS seems to be a form of drug addictive behavior, similar to that of the usual addictive drugs.",

It was thus the intent of this study to assess the sleeping pattern of depressed elders living in elderly homes. Results of the present study revealed that, the majority of the studied depressed elders had sleeping difficulties and more than half of them took more than 60 minutes in bed to fall asleep. Almost all the subjects woke up more than 3 times during the night, and the most frequently reported causes were frequency of micturition, anxiety, and pain. Three-quarters of the studied elders did not feel comfortable when waking up in the morning, and this affected their ability to perform their daily living activities. It is thus recommended to encourage elderly clients to establish a routine sleep schedule, to stick to rituals that help to relax before bed time and to suggest consultation with appropriate specialist depending on the underlying causes of the sleep disorder.",

A number of sleep disorders exist; the categories range from disorders of sleepiness, or hypersomnia, to disorders resulting in insomnia. Also included are circadian rhythm abnormalities and sleep-related breathing disorders. In obtaining the sleep history, one should start by determining the presenting symptom or primary reason the patient has come for evaluation. The majority of sleep complaints can be divided into excessive sleepiness, difficulties with falling asleep or staying asleep, and abnormal behaviors or sensations associated with sleep. Social factors such as work schedules, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol use, and stressors have sleep-related implications. Sleep disorders often have a genetic or familial tendency.",

      "abstract": "Transient recurrent confusional and stuporous states of nonepileptic origin are clearly less frequent than epileptic ones. They are relatively common in diseases of disturbed vigilance, like narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, and sleep apnea. These patients often suffer from attacks of hypovigilance, characterized by altered awareness, automatic behaviour and partial or complete amnesia for the attack. Because of the memory 'black outs' and the frequently associated hypnagogic hallucinations, the patients behave inappropriately and often appear confused. Confusional states also typically arise during basilar artery migraine attacks. This special form of complicated migraine predominantly affects young females and is characterized by symptoms and signs of brain stem dysfunction such as vertigo, ataxia, paresthesia, limb weakness, dysarthria; in 75% of the cases, disorders of consciousness dominate. Transient ischemic attacks are sometimes recurrent and, when involving the cranial basilar territory, may result in confusional states without significant motor dysfunction. Attacks of transient global amnesia are possibly also ischemic in nature and are assumed to arise from transient bilateral limbic failure. Affecting only memory functions, they are strictly spoken not confusional, but must nevertheless be taken into consideration when proper observation during the attack was not possible.",

      "title": "Brain mechanisms of insomnia: new perspectives on causes and consequences",
      "abstract": "While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\". The proposed model opens up the possibility for novel intervention studies and animal studies, thus accelerating the ignition of a neuroscience of insomnia, which is direly needed for better treatment.",

It becomes more fragmented as we age, with more night‐time awakenings and greater tendency for daytime sleep. The magnitude of disordered sleep among individuals affected by dementia has been clearly demonstrated, and disturbed sleep is a major clinical problem in dementia. Comorbid insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such A lzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders. How and when sleep problems manifest themselves can depend on the type of dementia involved as well as the stage of the dementia. However, differences in sleep pattern presentation show more variation during the initial stages of dementias than they do during the later stages. Effective, pragmatic interventions are largely anecdotal and untested.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia: a practical review.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia has numerous, often concurrent etiologies, including medical conditions, medications, psychiatric disorders and poor sleep hygiene. In the elderly, insomnia is complex and often difficult to relieve because the physiologic parameters of sleep normally change with age. In most cases, however, a practical management approach is to first consider depression, medications, or both, as potential causes. Sleep apnea also should be considered in the differential assessment. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, most patients benefit from behavioral approaches that focus on good sleep habits. Exposure to bright light at appropriate times can help realign the circadian rhythm in patients whose sleep-wake cycle has shifted to undesirable times. Periodic limb movements during sleep are very common in the elderly and may merit treatment if the movements cause frequent arousals from sleep. When medication is deemed necessary for relief of insomnia, a low-dose sedating antidepressant or a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic may offer advantages over traditional sedative-hypnotics. Longterm use of long-acting benzodiazepines should, in particular, be avoided. Melatonin may be helpful when insomnia is related to shift work and jet lag; however, its use remains controversial.",

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

      "title": "Palliative sedation: welcome guidance on a controversial issue",
      "abstract": "Palliative sedation (PS) is the use of medications to reduce consciousness for the relief of intolerable and refractory symptoms, in patients with limited life expectancy. The ethical justification of palliative sedation is based upon the principles of double effect, autonomy and proportionality. Double effect is predicated upon the primary intent being to relieve suffering, despite potential foreseeable, but unintended, adverse effects. Proportionality is based upon the use of PS in the face of intolerable distress as a ‘therapy of last resort’, when all other potentially less harmful options have been expended or are inappropriate. PS is neither slow euthanasia nor physician-assisted suicide. Both of these practices involve the specific intent to end life, the deliberate use of lethal doses of sedation drugs, or non-therapeutic escalation of doses disproportionate to symptom distress. PS does not shorten life overall (when implemented in specialist palliative care units), despite the expected risk of individual complications (e.g. respiratory or hemodynamic compromise, aspiration, or venous thromboembolism). Sedative drugs first appeared in modern medicine in the 19th century, with bromide and chloral hydrate. Barbiturates were introduced in 1903, and benzodiazepines in 1959. The first descriptions of sedation for symptom control in advanced disease were published in 1990–1991. The early literature described a wide range in prevalence, indications and clinical practices. The prevalence in these reports ranged from 16% to over 50%. Indications included agitation and restlessness, pain, delirium, respiratory distress, myoclonus, and psychological symptoms. Drugs used for sedation included benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and barbiturates. Despite a number of prospective studies and published guidelines, evidence upon which to base practice has remained limited and controversial issues persist. These include almost every aspect of PS; the definition and terminology (palliative versus terminal), the types of sedation included under this term (intermittent versus continuous, light versus deep), the indications (physical or existential distress), the use of artificial hydration and nutrition, and the ethical basis and differentiation from euthanasia. Decisions about palliative sedation are complex and can have significant implications for the patient and lasting impact on family and staff. Staff need to develop awareness of their own preferences about care of the dying, and the potential role of frustration, sense of failure and burnout in decision making. Individual physician personal and professional factors may influence the practice of PS, including prevalence, determination of refractoriness, level of sedation used, and drugs employed. Families and staff need extensive support to understand the decision-making process, and be clear about the goals and expected outcomes. Identifying a family spokesperson (preferably one chosen by the patient) may help communication, especially for large, geographically scattered or conflicted families. Without effective communication families may be left with feelings of profound confusion, guilt or remorse, which complicate their subsequent bereavement. For these reasons evaluation and decision making by a multidisciplinary team skilled in palliative care is essential prior to initiating PS. Initiating PS without palliative medicine involvement is potentially hazardous. Palliative medicine consultation has been demonstrated to elicit previously undocumented diagnoses (especially delirium), and suggest multiple management strategies in advanced cancer, even within tertiary cancer centers. A dilemma in decision making arises where there is a lack of access to, or awareness of, specialized interventions including palliative medicine, psychiatry, interventional pain management, and spiritual care. Non-palliative medicine physicians need to have insight into their own therapeutic limitations, whilst palliative medicine physicians should be available to provide support via telephone or videoconference to isolated clinicians.",

      "title": "Psychotic symptoms in young people warrant urgent referral.",
      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "title": "Some Aspects of Social Phobia and its Relationship with Substance use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Social Phobia (SP) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorder, characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations. People with social phobia have an intense, persistent, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and of doing things that will embarrass them. This excessive anxiety usually leads to avoidance behavior that can severely affect normal daily living. SP usually begins in childhood or early adolescence. There is some evidence that genetic factors are involved. A number of studies have emphasized the high co-morbidity of social phobia with a number of other psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. Though clearly elevated there is much debate as to the nature of this relationship. Substance abuse may develop if people try to self-medicate their anxiety and make thamselves more comfortable in social situations. Anxiety may be a result of alcohol or drug abuse due to a substance's anxiogenic effects or through protracted withdrawal syndromes. Substance abusers incur more pathological and unstable life circumstances, making them more susceptible to future stress and anxiety; and there may be a genetic susceptibility in some people which makes them vulnerable to both disorders. The purpose of this article is to summarize research findings on SP and its complex relationship with substance use disorder. Clinical anxiety and substance abuse both warrant treatment and in all likelihood, each helps perpetuate the other.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "The integrity of time consciousness is the condition of possibility of the identity through time of an object of perception as well as of the person who perceives it. I will present our findings about abnormal time experience (ATE) in people with schizophrenia. These data may support the following hypothesis: if the continuity of temporal experience disintegrates (of which ATE are experiential manifestations), overarching meaningful units are no longer available, thereby creating temporal gaps, e.g., in one's stream of consciousness. In some cases, thoughts that are no longer experienced as embedded in one's stream of thoughts are experienced as, e.g., thought interferences, blockages, insertion or withdrawal. These symptoms cannot be explained as a mere disturbance of attention or comprehension at the level of semantic combinations. Rather, the disturbance could be searched for at a more basic level where the temporal coherence of conscious awareness is constituted. A failure of the constitutive temporal synthesis may create micro-gaps of conscious experience. In the most severe cases, thoughts or other mental phenomena that are no longer embedded in the continuity of basic self-experience may appear in consciousness as “erratic blocks” and experienced as being inserted, or, if further externalized, as auditory hallucinations (“voices”). This coheres with the hypothesis that a breakdown of temporality may be bound up with the breakdown of prereflexive self-awareness.

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

      "abstract": "Most psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, or neurotic disorders are associated with sleep disorders of various kinds, among which insomnia is most prevalent and important in psychiatric practice. Almost all patients suffering from major depression complain of insomnia. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia associated with major depression shortens the duration to achieve remission of depression. Insomnia has been recently reported to be a risk factor for depression. Hypersomnia is also a major sleep problem in patient suffering from depression. There have been no clinical guide to treat the symptoms of hypersomnia in depression, but some clinical trials treating them with NDRI or adjunctive administration of psychostimulants. In patients with schizophrenia, insomnia is often an early indicator of the aggravation of psychotic symptoms. Electroencephalographic sleep studies have also revealed sleep abnormalities characteristic to mood disorders, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. A shortened REM sleep latency has been regarded as a biological marker of depression. Reduced amount of deep Non-REM sleep has been reported to be correlated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, REM sleep abnormalities were found in teenagers having post-traumatic stress disorder after a boat accident. Although these facts indicate that insomnia plays an important role in the development of psychiatric disorders, there are few hypotheses explaining the cause and effect of insomnia in these disorders. Here, we reviewed recent articles on insomnia and hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders together with their clinical managements.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

      "title": "Clinical Q&amp;A",
      "abstract": "A nswer: Dyspnea (breathlessness), an unpleasant awareness of breathing, is a subjective experience. This symptom is all too common, with reports of more than 70% of patients with advanced cancer experiencing this symptom (Ripamonti, 1999). Unfortunately, the mechanisms that lead to dyspnea are not well understood. Patients’ self-report of dyspnea is the best indicator of its presence and level of distress. Respiratory rate and oxygenation saturation level are not reliable indicators of the presence of dyspnea. Patients tend to experience a chronic course, punctuated by episodes of acute shortness of breath. Dyspnea has physical and affective components, which may worsen anxiety and frighten patients. When dyspnea persists, patients often decrease their daily activities. Social isolation, dependence on others, and physiologic, psychological, social, and spiritual exhaustion may result (Coyne, Lyne, & Watson, 2002). Patients’ previous experiences with dyspnea influence their perception of breathlessness. Some patients have described dyspnea as “breathing through a straw.” Healthcare providers sometimes underrecognize the impact of this symptom because of its subjective nature. Concurrent treatments, including nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies, should be initiated on a case-by-case basis. Oxygen therapy is recommended for dyspneic patients at the end stage of disease (Bruera, deStoutz, Valasco-Leiva, Schoeller, & Hanson, 1993). Other nonpharmacologic treatments for dyspnea include positioning for comfort. Propping patients up on pillows in a forward sitting position may improve air exchange. Cool air blown by fans or air from an open window or air conditioner also may be helpful. The presence of calm and reassuring family members and caregivers as well as the use of soothing, relaxing music and pursed-lip breathing can reduce anxiety, slow respiratory rate, and reduce dyspnea. Guided imagery and meditation, massage, and prayer are other therapies that can promote comfort and relaxation (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN] & City of Hope Medical Center [COH], 2002). Pharmacologic treatment of dyspnea includes the use of combinations of opioids, anxiolytics, sedatives, tranquilizers, and anticholinergic medications (AACN & COH, 2002; Newshan & Sherman, 1999). However, traditional bronchodilators, mucolytic agents, and anxiolytics often are suboptimal in treating dyspnea related to malignancy. In addition, adrenergic agonists and theophylline may cause increased anxiety and agitation and worsen patients’ breathing status (Storey, 1994). Opioids have been used effectively for more than a century to relieve breathlessness, but their mechanism is not clearly understood (Coyne, Viswanathan, & Smith, 2002). Starting opioids early in treatment will facilitate development of tolerance to respiratory effects and allow titration to comfort levels that will reduce anxiety and distress (Twycross, 1994). Nebulizer opioids using morphine, although a promising concept, has shown no benefit in controlled trials (Davis, Penn, A’Hern, Daniels, & Slevin, 1996; Runo & Ely, 2001). Nebulizer furosemide has been shown to protect against bronchospasms, which may be an etiology of dyspnea (Bianco, Vaghi, Robuschi, & Pasargiklian, 1998). Early pilot studies utilizing nebulizer fentanyl appear promising, perhaps because of this opioid’s lipophilic properties (Coyne, Viswanathan, et al.). Research regarding this intervention presently is ongoing. Because as much as 70% of the opioid is not absorbed systemically, few, if any, side effects are seen (Coyne, Viswanathan, et al.). In the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals and Virginia Commonwealth University, nebulizer fentanyl is an intervention used with any patient experiencing ongoing dyspnea regardless of its etiology. The standard dose used in this facility is 25 mcg of fentanyl with 2 ml of normal saline administered every two to three hours as needed. The nursing staff, rather than respiratory therapists, administers the medication because fentanyl is a controlled substance. Nurses using this intervention should evaluate patients for subjective and objective improvements in dyspnea. The only known contraindication to nebulized fentanyl is an allergy to fentanyl. The treatment of dyspnea remains a problem for many patients. Research clearly is needed to improve the current interventions. With regard to the management of dyspnea with nebulized fentanyl, healthcare providers need to determine the half-life of nebulized fentanyl, whether it is safe when given more frequently than every two to three hours, and whether this treatment can be used in the homecare setting and administered by family and caregivers. Patients experiencing dyspnea require ongoing support and thorough assessment to ensure maximum comfort is achieved and maintained.",

      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake pattern constitute one of the major complaints of patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including major depression disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse. Recent advances have cast light on the mecanisms underlying modifications in sleep in psychiatric disorders, offering new approaches in management and opening new avenues of research. Isnomnia and psychiatric disorders, especially depression, are intimately linked. Insomnia, defined as a difficulty in initiating and/or in maintaining sleep leading to daytime repercussions, is not simply a symptom of depression but an independent diagnostic entity, and is known to be an independent risk factor for both depression itself and the development of a new depression episode or relapse. To date, the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the relationships between insomnia and affective disorders are not yet fully understood. The review by Chiara Baglioni et al. examines the latest findings from several fields of research, with particular attention to alterations of the arousal system leading to hyperarousal and to the possible biological mechanisms involved in the link between sleep alteration, insomnia, regulation of emotion, and mood symptoms. Links between depression sleep and circadian rhythms have long been suspected due to the existence of seasonal depression, where the onset of low mood correlates with a reduction in day length. Seasonal affective disorder (SA) is primarily a circadian rhythm disorder. Alfred Lewy discusses the theory of misalignement between the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion and the midpoint of the sleep bout, and emphasise the importance or careful timing of treatment administration (bright light or melatonin). Timing of treatment administration requiring detailed information on patients’ phase state and the role of new accessible tools such as dim light melatonine onset are evaluated as are different treatment modalities. The importance of biological rhythms in SA disorder has led to an interest in the role of circadian rhythms in the development of depression. The successes of chronobiotic treatments for SA disorder have led to the trialling of psychological and pharmacological treatments targeting circadian rhythms in unipolar major depression (MDD). The review by Sarah Hartley et al. focuses on the research linking circadian rhythms and depression, and on the evidence for effectiveness of chronobiotic treatments such as high intensity light, melatonin or melatonin agonist or behavioural therapy in MDD. The evidence base for novel antidepressants combining 5HT2c antagonist and melatonin agonist action in acute treatment of unipolar MDD and in relapse prevention is reviewed as is their use in clinical management of MDD. Managing bipolar disorder is a challenge for psychiatrists and it has been long known that sleep disorders are a sign of relapse. Carole Boudebesse et al. examine the evidence that sleep and circadian rhythms are disturbed in bipolar patients during both mood episodes and periods of remission. Therapeutic applications of chronobiology in bipolar disorder, such as specific psychosocial interventions, light therapy and physical exercise are described. Finally, psychiatrists are faced with frequent reports of sleep disorders in adults and children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, conversely, sleep specialists report certain symptoms of ADHD (attention deficits, fidgeting) in patients suffering from primary sleep disorders. Are ADHD symptoms secondary to sleep fragmentation due to sleep disorders such as sleep disordered breathing and periodic legs movements, and treatable with treatment of these specific disorders? Could some ADHD subjects share a common deficit in the sleep/wake regulation systems resulting in sleep fragmentation? The pathophysiological relationship between sleep disorders and ADHD is complex and probably multidirectional. The hot topic from the team of Astrid Claret et al. reviews the latest research and aims to help clinicians in developing a framework for understanding and treating patients suffering from ADHD and sleep disorders.",

Since the hypochondriac's flooding, but unsymbolized, anxiety is so prevalent, hypochondria has been historically classified as one of the types of actual neurosis, a term used by Freud to include intense physical and emotional states. The intricate relation between hypochondriac anxiety and excessive daydreaming has important implications for our clinical work. Even in otherwise relatively well functioning personalities, the hypochondriac involvement with the body might become so extensive that, at its extremity. It can induce autistic-like withdrawals into a world of hypertrophied attention to one's sensations, where daydreaming disease and deterioration and the ensuing flooding anxiety become densely intermingled, creating a very painful and detached existence.",

      "title": "REM Sleep Instability – A New Pathway for Insomnia?",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia afflicts approximately 10% of the adult population and is associated with daytime impairments and an elevated risk for developing somatic and mental disorders. Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.",

Snoring which is often loud and habitual accompanied with daytime sleepiness tiredness are common manifestations. OSA often exhibit mood swings. Studies suggest a close association of OSA depression and anxiety. The management of OSA chiefly rests on the usage of continuous positive airway pressure CPAP while sleeping. The results have been rewarding. Its regular usage not only corrects the sleep disorder but also shows benefits in the consequences. Reports suggest that depression in OSA gradually resolves with CPAP usage. The association of OSA depression and anxiety needs to be explored further.nbsp",

      "abstract": "A share of older persons among the general population has been increasing. Mental health is the most important determinant of health status of older people. Anxiety in later life is the most common mental disease. Various diseases and symptoms often occur at the advanced age. In older adults, anxiety disorders are associated with an increased risk of comorbidities. Although insomnia is not a normal part of the ageing process, its prevalence increases with age. Many older people experience dissatisfaction with the quantity and quality of sleep, even if they get enough sleep. Ageing is associated with some changes in parameters of sleep architecture and continuity. There are several demographic, psychosocial, biological, and behavioural factors that may contribute to insomnia later in life. Older people are subject to greater risk for the physical and mental consequences of insomnia. Patients with long-term insomnia usually experience anxiety and depression. Evidence suggests that there is a complex bidirectional relationship between insomnia and anxiety in the elderly. Sleep disturbances are part of the anxiety disorder pattern. Therefore, healthcare workers must obtain comprehensive information about the health and sleep status of older people to correctly diagnose insomnia, anxiety, and identify potential correlates of these disorders. Taking a careful and complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination is the most important aspect of their evaluation. If insomnia and anxiety are diagnosed in later life, therapy should include non-drug and drug treatments, taking into account possible side effects.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

Sleep is a state of inactivity accompanied by a loss of awareness and a markedly reduced responsiveness to environmental stimuli. When a recording is made of an electroencephalogram (EEG) and other physiological variables such as muscle activity and eye movements during sleep (a technique called polysomnography) a pattern of sleep consisting of five different stages emerges. This pattern varies from person to person, but usually consists of four or five cycles of quiet sleep alternating with paradoxical (active) sleep, with longer periods of paradoxical sleep in the latter half of the night. A representation of these various stages over time is known as a hypnogram, and one of these derived from a normal control subject is shown in Figure 1. The quiet sleep is divided further into four stages, each with a characteristic EEG appearance, with progressive relaxation of the muscles and slower, more regular breathing as the deeper stages are reached. Most sleep in these deeper stages occurs in the first half of the night.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

Despite this they have to experience sociopsychological attitudes which are prejudices with a typical stereotype which ignore the unique structure of everybody's potential who lost eyesight. The source of prejudices is general lack of information of people as regards actual sequelae of loss of eyesight and the emotional reaction of people with normal eyesight. A certain part is also played by tradition which does not take into account results of modern care of thus affected subjects. Prejudices cause in subjects with severely affected eyesight and in blind persons mental stress and render their actual social integration (employment, partnership etc.) more difficult.

      "title": "The influence of sleep on fear extinction in trauma-related disorders",
      "abstract": "In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), fear and anxiety become dysregulated following psychologically traumatic events. Regulation of fear and anxiety involves both high-level cognitive processes such as cognitive reattribution and low-level, partially automatic memory processes such as fear extinction, safety learning and habituation. These latter processes are believed to be deficient in PTSD. While insomnia and nightmares are characteristic symptoms of existing PTSD, abundant recent evidence suggests that sleep disruption prior to and acute sleep disturbance following traumatic events both can predispose an individual to develop PTSD. Sleep promotes consolidation in multiple memory systems and is believed to also do so for low-level emotion-regulatory memory processes. Consequently sleep disruption may contribute to the etiology of PTSD by interfering with consolidation in low-level emotion-regulatory memory systems. During the first weeks following a traumatic event, when in the course of everyday life resilient individuals begin to acquire and consolidate these low-level emotion-regulatory memories, those who will develop PTSD symptoms may fail to do so. This deficit may, in part, result from alterations of sleep that interfere with their consolidation, such as REM fragmentation, that have also been found to presage later PTSD symptoms. Here, sleep disruption in PTSD as well as fear extinction, safety learning and habituation and their known alterations in PTSD are first briefly reviewed. Then neural processes that occur during the early post-trauma period that might impede low-level emotion regulatory processes through alterations of sleep quality and physiology will be considered. Lastly, recent neuroimaging evidence from a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in patient groups and their controls will be considered along with one possible neural process that may contribute to a vulnerability to PTSD following trauma.",

Whereas it was initially conceptualised as a symptom of other psychiatric or medical disorders [21] current nosological classifications of sleep disorders make a distinction between the symptom (secondary) and the syndrome (primary) of insomnia [1,2]. Along with these changes in conceptualisation, there have been significant advances in the management of insomnia, from a predominantly symptomatic approach to a more focused behavioral approach on perpetuating factors.

The consequence of this is the accumulation of traumatic or stressful developments in people. Stress or trauma is interpreted as an event beyond normal human experience. One form of illness that is associated with this is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD engages the affected person as a whole by acting on all aspects of person's development, that is, biological, psychological and social aspects. Biological plan includes the changes in the functioning of the nervous system, disruption of neurotransmitters such as cortisol, epinephrine, endorphins etc., which leads to changes in the mood and functions of our organism. In the psychological sphere, the victim manifests numerous symptoms, such as dissociation, learned helplessness, intrusive dreams and memories, emotional dullness, solitariness, depression, etc. In the social environment, especially in the family, large dysfunction occur. The victim unfavourably affects his or her environment, which at the same time represents, or at least it should represent, the supporting structure in overcoming the difficulties. The victims of PTSD live a difficult life in which each new day represents the beginning of a struggle with oneself. What is considered ordinary and normal, like self-control, sense of security or desire to discover new things, respresents a remarkable effort and hard work to the victims of PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an efficient form of psychotherapy whose effectiveness is proven by numerous clinical studies in the treatments of various psychological disorders. Therefore, the importance of conduction of treatments in order to enable the ill persons to deal with the situation in the easiest possible way is incontestable. With family support, understanding environment, participating in therapies and pastoral models which are provided by the Church and which can be provided with spiritual-psychological assistance, the victim of the disorder can work on himself or herself and thus expect positive steps in dealing with the illness.",

      "abstract": "People with intellectual disabilities (ID) often present with persistent sleep difficulties which can, in themselves, contribute significantly to their overall handicap, but these mostly represent the result of poor sleep habits and can respond well to healthy sleep-promoting advice and behavioural strategies. A variety of medical and psychiatric factors may also produce marked sleep disruption. All of these factors are in this chapter. A recent randomised double-masked placebo-controlled trial in children with neurodevelopmental disorders showed that melatonin reduced sleep onset latency but at the same time was associated with earlier waking time than placebo. Melatonin is not generally considered to produce tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependency, problems often associated with other sedative hypnotics. The chapter explains the use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. The misalignment of the internal sleep-wake circadian clock with environmental day/night patterns and other environmental cues may also result in sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Psychogenic Vertigo",
      "abstract": "The sensation of vertigo, a subjective complaint, is sometimes defined as a hallucination of movement or an illusion. Since evaluation of hallucinations and illusions is an essential part of psychiatric practice, such definitions place vertigo at the doorstep of clinical psychiatry (Trimble 1984). Vertigo is a frequent symptom of psychiatric illness, in particular in anxiety, depression, and personahty disorders, but less frequent in psychosis. However, to complicate matters, because of its incapacitating nature vestibular dysfunction frequently causes psychiatric illness. This may bias the diagnosis of organic vertigo syndromes by a considerable neurotic overlay e.g. in patients with Menière's disease. Alternatively, a transient labyrinthine dysfunction, e.g. in vestibular neuritis, may initiate development of neurosis in which anxiety, panic attacks and depression are most common, and which typically preserves subjective vertigo and postural imbalance although the peripheral lesion is already either recovered or centrally compensated. In the latter case there is a history of an initial rotational vertigo, lateropulsion and nausea (with the objective clinical signs of horizontal rotatory nystagmus and unilateral hyporesponsiveness to caloric irrigation) which is followed by a more indefinite chronic dizziness with subjective postural imbalance or spells of vertigo during active body movements, associated with anxiety and change in behaviour (see Phobic Postural Vertigo, p. 292). Obsessional subjects are more likely to proceed from organic to psychiatric disease, and the obvious presence of an obsessional personality will support the diagnosis of this condition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the requirements for sleep do not appear to decline with aging, the ability to sleep and achieve consolidated sleep may decrease in some older adults. Approximately 50% of older adults complain of sleep disturbance. Older adults often take longer to fall asleep, have lower sleep efficiencies, and have more nighttime awakenings. They are also sleepier during the day than younger adults. Compared to elderly men, women are better able to maintain satisfactory sleep with aging. Aging is associated with changes in sleep architecture (Box 14–1). Greater nighttime sleep disturbance may lead to daytime sleepiness and more frequent daytime napping. Significant disturbances may occur during sleep with aging (Table 14–1). Although some of the observed changes can be attributed to normal aging itself (eg, age-related alterations in circadian rhythms), most are due to comorbid medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and primary sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Chez l'homme, l'hypoxie correspond a une inadequation entre les besoins tissulaires et les apports en oxygene. Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia is associated with social, economic, and individual burdens, including loss of independence, poor quality of life, and disability. In a short period of time, ideas about sarcopenia transformed from geriatric syndrome to disease. Initially, sarcopenia was considered in the context of gradual age-related deterioration in the functioning of all physiological systems. Over the years, it became clear that it can develop a second time, as a consequence of various diseases and pathological conditions. To date, there have been no generally accepted diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. There are several tests and tools available for screening sarcopenia, the choice of which depends on physical capabilities of the patient, capabilities of the medical institution, and the purpose for which it is detected (research or clinical practice). From the point of view of human health, sarcopenia increases the risk of falls and fractures; impairs the ability to perform daily activities; is associated with the progression of major diseases and cognitive impairments; leads to movement disorders; contributes to a decrease in the quality of life, loss of independence or a need for long-term care. The presence of sarcopenia increases both the risk of hospitalization and hospitalization costs. The aim of the literature review is to provide an analysis of up-to-date information on the causes, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and consequences of sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and sarcopenic obesity. The search for literature containing information on relevant studies was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar by the following keywords: sarcopenia, dynapenia, myosteatosis, sarcopenic obesity, nutritional status, malnutrition.",

Sleep disorder can cause many complications, including the worsening of the brain injury prognosis. Insomnia occurs in 29% traumatic brain injury patient. Insomnia suspected due injury in inferior frontal, anterior temporal including basal forebrain, also sympathetic nerve hyperactivity. Insomnia increase the risk of stroke, disability and mood disturbance. Hypersomnia occurs in 28% traumatic brain injury patients. Hypersomnia suspected due orexin decrease and injury in sleep promoting area. Hypersomnia suspected related to recovery, less activity time and accident due sleepiness. There are no prevalence data of circadian rhythm disturbance after traumatic brain injury. This disturbance is caused by injury in supra-chiasmatic nucleus and related to global worsening on the patient. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly linked with injury area, but hypersomnia is not particularly linked to any area and only related to orexin decrease. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly related to the worsening condition on the patient, but hypersomnia is associated with recovery and not particularly related to any disturbances. It is hoped that understanding the sleep disorder after traumatic brain injury can rise the alertness of this matter and encourage clinicians to increase the quality of sleep disorder due to traumatic brain injury management. Cedera kepala merupakan salah satu cedera yang umum terjadi. Cedera ini sering diikuti dengan gangguan tidur seperti insomnia, hipersomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian. Gangguan ini sering dapat menyebabkan berbagai komplikasi termasuk memperparah penyembuhan cedera kepala. Insomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 29%. Insomnia diduga disebabkan oleh cedera pada daerah inferior frontal, anterior temporal termasuk basal otak depan, juga peningkatan kerja saraf simpatis. Insomnia meningkatkan resiko stroke, disabilitas dan gangguan suasana hati. Hipersomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 28%. Hipersomnia diduga akibat penurunan orexin dan akibat kerusakan pada area yang mempertahankan bangun. Hipersomnia diduga berhubungan dengan penyembuhan, waktu tersita akibat tidur dan kecelakaan akibat mengantuk. Belum ada data prevalensi gangguan ritme sirkadian setelah cedera kepala. Gangguan ini disebabkan oleh cedera pada nukleus suprakiasmatik dan sering dikaitkan dengan perburukan kondisi pasien. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian sering dihubungkan dengan lokasi tertentu dari cedera, namun hipersomnia berhubungan dengan kadar orexin dan tidak terlalu dikaitkan terhadap area tertentu. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian berhubungan dengan perburukan, namun hipersomnia bisa menandakan perbaikan dan tidak berhubungan signifikan dengan gangguan lainnya. Diharapkan dengan memahami gangguan tidur ini dapat meningkatkan kewaspadaan bagi para klinisi dan mendorong untuk penelitian berikutnya sehingga penanganan pasien gangguan tidur akibat cedera kepala dapat menjadi lebih baik.",

Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant.

      "title": "Case Study : Prognosis of Recurrent Depressive Disorder with Somatic Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is a common disease worldwide, with more than 264 million people affected. Especially if it lasts a long time and is of moderate or severe intensity, depression can be a serious health condition. Depression can cause affected people to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school, and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. In general, the good prognosis of depressive episodes can be achieved as well as good response to treatment and early interventions, but with the absence of any other complication such as psychotic symptoms and somatic complaints. This paper discusses the prognosis of recurrent depressive disorders with somatic complaints through a case study. Case: Male 23 years old complained of headaches that did not improve with pain medication and often recurred for two weeks, feels tingling and heavy in the back, worsening at night, interfere with the patient's daily activities and sleep in the night. These depressive symptoms have recurred since the patient was 19 years old. The patient experienced repeated stress due to arguments between his parents who were often involved in verbal abuse. The patient's prognosis is analyzed using several aspects according to Maramis prognosis analysis, including age, premorbid personality, type of disorder, course of treatment, hereditary factors, and the presence/absence of precipitating factors. Discussion: According to the course of the disease, the patient experienced recurrent depression since the age of less than 20 years, with somatic symptoms currently accompanying his depressive disorder. The patient experienced repeated recurrences even though he was stated to have improved by the treating doctor, which indicates that the patient's stress management was inadequate. The patient is currently experiencing a skin disorder that worsens his pessimistic feelings and is receiving SSRI antidepressants to improve his depressive symptoms. Based on the analysis of the course of the disease, the prognosis for depressive disorders in patients is poor, or dubia ad bonam. Conclusions: Recurrent depressive disorders involving younger ages, complications such as somatic symptoms, suboptimal social support, inadequate coping mechanisms, will worsen the prognosis of depression even after receiving adequate treatment",

      "title": "Sleep Apnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases affecting the respiratory system are usually present during the day and the night; however, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a disease manifesting only during sleep. It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

Other facts are known as well – that not only can psychiatric illness result in sleep problems, but that these same problems can exacerbate psychopathology and that they constitute risk factors for suicide. Sleep difficulties are known to respond well to appropriate treatment and yet, with the exception of insomnia, sleep quality is not routinely inquired about during psychiatric assessments. This narrative review focuses on nightmares in the context of schizophrenia and the results suggest that they are both common and distressing. They are also potentially dangerous. The alleviation of nightmares can improve the quality of life for persons suffering from schizophrenia and can lower the risk of suicide.",

      "abstract": "The immediate response to the traumatic event in individuals who may develop ASD2 or PTSD involves intense fear, helplessness or horror. ASD is experienced during or immediately after the trauma, lasts for at least 2 days, and either resolves within 4 weeks or the diagnosis has to be adjusted. A diagnosis of PTSD may be appropriate provided the full criteria for PTSD are met [2]. Of individuals who respond to the trauma with intense fear or horror 15–35% will eventually develop a significant degree of dysfunction and distress [3], namely PTSD, for a considerable length of time. The PTSD symptoms can be grouped into three main clusters. The first is persistent re-experience of the traumatic event, such as recurrent dreams and flashbacks. The second is persistent avoidance of internal or external cues associated with the trauma, such as avoiding thoughts, avoiding activities, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, and sense of foreshortened future. The third is increased arousal, which is manifested as difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response [2]. The marked discrepancy between the proportion of the general population exposed to traumatic events and the proportion that ultimately fulfills the criteria for PTSD is a challenging aspect of the study of stress-related disorders. Identification of factors that increase vulnerability of individuals and factors that increase resilience may have important implications in public health.

Clinically, the distinguishing feature of sleep, in contrast to coma, is the ease with which the sleeping subject can be roused to awareness of the external world. Between alertness and coma are a variety of altered states of consciousness. Palliative sedation refers to the intentional clinical practice of suppressing consciousness to control refractory symptoms during the last days or hours of life, in a manner that is ethically acceptable to the patient, family and healthcare providers. The intractable symptoms, which have proven non-responsive to all other interventions, are contained by the induction and the continuance of deep sedation. Deep sedation may need to be maintained until death; the duration is usually in the range of 1–6 days. Trial releases of deep sedation can be orchestrated, if required, by withholding the dose or administering flumazenil. The dosage necessary to induce deep sedation is variable.",

They often represent the first or main manifestation of underlying disorders of the central nervous system, which require specific work-up and treatment. Diverse and often combined cause factors have been identified. Although recent data provide some evidence regarding abnormal activation and/or disinhibition of motor circuits during sleep, for the majority of these disorders the pathogenetic mechanisms remain speculative. The differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult and misdiagnoses are not infrequent. The diagnosis is based on clinical and video-polysomnographic findings. Treatment of sleep-related motor disturbances with few exceptions (e.g. restless legs/limbs syndrome) are based mainly on anecdotal reports or small series.More state-of-the-art studies on the cause, pathophysiology, and treatment of sleep-related movement disorders and disturbances of motor control are needed.",

      "title": "Sleep and Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Sleep problems and fatigue are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The etiology of these disturbances is multifactorial. Sleep disturbance and fatigue after TBI can be a result of the trauma itself or can be secondary to medical problems, pain, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and/or side effects of medications. Because sleep disturbance is common in the general population, the clinician needs to differentiate between premorbid sleep problems and those that are temporally related to TBI. The complex relationship between sleep and TBI can be understood as a series of mutually independent processes. First, acute brain injury can lead to disrupted levels of consciousness and a disrupted sleep process. A second and distinct type of sleep disruption often develops in the chronic phase of recovery; during this phase, severity of injury is often another factor that influences the type and nature of sleep problems experienced by patients. Finally, subjective and objective measures of sleep disturbance may be discordant, in that subjective complaints may occur without objective evidence, and vice versa (Orff et al. 2009). The relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders is also complex. The neural mechanisms that mediate sleep also have a role in the regulation and stabilization of mood. Dysfunction of these neural circuits after TBI can, therefore, cause both mood and sleep problems. In addition, psychotropics can exacerbate sleep problems, and sleep disturbances can precipitate psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and dysphoria. Fatigue is a nonspecific and highly subjective symptom that is often reported in patients with TBI. It is described as a feeling of exhaustion, tiredness, or weakness. In many ways, sleep disturbances after TBI are better defined and understood than symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, in this chapter, we first discuss the normal sleep cycle, and then the prevalence, pathophysiology, and types of posttraumatic sleep dis-orders, followed by the evaluation and treatment of these sleep dis-turbances. We then focus on fatigue after TBI. Although sleep disturbances and fatigue overlap, we treat them as separate entities, for clarity. We briefly review the literature and make practical suggestions for the management of sleep and fatigue following TBI. A more detailed description of TBI sleep disturbances can be found in the chapter \"Fatigue and Sleep Problems\" in the Textbook of Traumatic Brain Injury (Rao et al. 2005).",

Inappropriate sleep habits in children have increased in developed countries and have become a major public health concern. Indeed, the impositions of daily life in technologically advanced societies on sleep and wake schedules have markedly shortened the total duration of sleep that children obtain these days. When sleep fragmentation is conducted in healthy adults using auditory stimuli to elicit arousals throughout the night, detriments in performance are clearly apparent the following day. Acute sleep restriction for one night in children has been shown to increase inattentive behavior the following day, although no changes were observed in hyperactive or impulsive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

Given the fact that obesity is a major risk factor for OSA, and given the current global rise in obesity, the prevalence of OSA will increase in the future. Individuals with sleep apnea are often unaware of their sleep disorder. It is usually first recognized as a problem by family members who witness the apneic episodes or is suspected by their primary care doctor because of the individual's risk factors and symptoms. The vast majority remain undiagnosed and untreated, despite the fact that this serious disorder can have significant consequences. Individuals with untreated OSA can stop breathing hundreds of times a night during their sleep. These apneic events can lead to fragmented sleep that is of poor quality, as the brain arouses briefly in order for the body to resume breathing. Untreated, sleep apnea can have dire health consequences and can increase the risk of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and heart failure. OSA management has also become important in a number of comorbid neurological conditions, including epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and headache. Diagnosis typically involves use of screening questionnaires, physical exam, and an overnight polysomnography or a portable home study. Treatment options include changes in lifestyle, positive airway pressure, surgery, and dental appliances.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a common and normal phenomenon, involving multiple brain regions, including amygdala, locus ceruleus and frontal cortex.Moreover, multiple brain transmitters regulate the presence and severity of anxiety; these include classical transmitters such as gamma amino butyric acid, serotonin, and dopamine, as well as neuropeptides that include corticotrophin releasing hormone, substance P, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin and vasopressin.Anxiety is highly adaptive and involves both acute fear, related to an immediate threat and anticipatory anxiety that is associated with possible future threat.Certain individuals are predisposed to develop anxiety disorders.Predisposing variables include both genetic factors (that may dispose toward anxious temperament), emotional traumas and other psychologically mediated factors.Anxiety disorders represent a family of conditions with important distinguishing elements.Panic disorder and phobias involve reactions that are reminiscent of acute fear (albeit often worse).Specific and social phobias involve excessive fearful responses to identifiable things or circumstances in the environment.Generalized anxiety disorder is a condition that, essentially, involves anticipatory fear (i.e., worry).Worries of everyday life are enhanced beyond any normal or adaptive functioning.Although complex, anxiety disorders are treatable conditions that respond to certain medications and specialized forms of psychotherapy.INTRODUCTION: Anxiety Disorders: Anxiety disorders are characterized by an excessive fear response; these disorders are extremely prevalent among the general population and have a 2:1 female predilection 1 .Functional impairment is common with these disorders and along with depression, is among the leading causes of disability and work related absences.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), defines fear as \"the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat\" and anxiety as anticipation of future threat.",

Rajas &amp; Tamas Manas Dosha are responsible for all the psychic disorders including Anxiety which is usually characterized by hyperactivity, state of excessive worry, fear and poor decision-making ability. Its psychopathology affects humans on somatic level as well. Mental health concerns touch most people’s lives directly or indirectly, it can affect a person’s work productivity, their personal and professional lives and in severe cases destroy their quality of life. Ayurveda takes two approaches Drug therapy like use of Medhya Rasayan, through internal as well as external method which enhances the function of intellect &amp; non-drug therapy like Aachar Rasayan, Satwavajaya Chikitsa &amp; Yoga therapy. Anxiety is more chronic as it often overshadowed by other health conditions like GIT problems. Hence exploring presenting problem involving mind-body relationship and finding a synergistic solution is the need of the hour, to reduce the stigma associated with it, by understanding Anxiety in depth from Ayurveda’s point of view.",

When standard societal timetables are superimposed upon this, major problems, such as insomnia, chronic sleep restriction, and excessive daytime sleepiness may arise. These enduring problems may often have profound impacts on performance, as well as mental and physical health. Numerous CRSWDs exist. Of these, a very small number are truly ‘intrinsic’ – that is due to inherited molecular dysfunction of the pacemaker. Ageing, behaviour, illness and the environment, may influence many of the disorders, and are likely to have a cumulative effect in any one individual. However, some disorders are more ‘extrinsic’ than others, such as shift work and jet lag disorder. The various types of CRSWDs are discussed within this chapter, as are the behavioural and pharmacological interventions that can be used in their management.",

      "abstract": "Anecdotal reports recount of individuals obtaining insights during sleep. For instance, various acclaimed scientists have attributed some of their greatest insights to sleep-related mentation. To date, this phenomenon has not been systematically investigated. The current study explored the occurrence and characteristics of Sleep-Related Insights (SRIs) in a large population sample, using a questionnaire approach. We found that a large majority of participants (~80%) experienced SRIs at some point in their lives and about 40% obtained SRIs regularly. Most of these subjects could link SRIs to remembered sleep mentation. SRIs were reported to occur in both sleep and half-sleep states, and at any point of the sleep period. Furthermore, SRIs regarded emotional preoccupations about twice as often as theoretical problems. Finally, SRIs were not robustly related to subjective sleep-quality, but small positive correlations with insomnia and narcolepsy-like symptoms were observed. In conclusion, SRIs are much more common than might have been expected, manifest in several forms and appear to be part of normal, healthy sleep. Importantly, the strong link of SRIs with sleep mentation suggests they result from some form of higher-order information processing during sleep, rather than being (fully) secondary to general restorative effects of sleep. Finally, our findings show that a large portion of the sampled population is aware of sleep's benefits for real life problem solving and experiences such benefits on a regular basis.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

Particularly potent are unexpected negative events, or “traumas,” such as a near death experience, a severe injury, or being exposed to intense interpersonal violence or a natural disaster. Although most people recover from these traumatic events, many do not, and experience persistent fear, anxiety and/or depression following the event. In the past, these maladaptations after trauma were considered to be a reflection of personal weaknesses and were stigmatized. Now, after 30 years of research, the physiological responses to severe stress and trauma are being increasingly understood, as are the risk factors for a pathological response to trauma. These gains from the study of memory and neurohormonal reactivity and control systems hold forth the promise of improved, biologically-informed, psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the future.",

Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico.

Narcolepsy is not rare, with a prevalence of 25–50/100,000 in Western Europe, however many individuals remain undiagnosed for many years after the onset of symptoms [1]. One third of adults with narcolepsy describe their first symptoms appearing before the age of 15 and there is a clear peak of onset in the teenage years [2]. The classic narcolepsy tetrad comprised excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotion, most frequently laughter), sleep paralysis and hypnagogic (on falling asleep) and hypnopompic (on waking) hallucinations. Disturbed nighttime sleep was often added to make up a pentad. These symptoms apart from excessive daytime sleep and cataplexy are not uncommon in unaffected individuals and other sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

      "abstract": "Sudden unexpected infant death may be explained, cause by an etiology, unexplained but insufficiently investigated, or unexplained when a full investigation fails to determine the cause. Unexplained sudden death in infancy or sudden infant death syndrome particularly affects the most vulnerable populations. The death of these children who are born with alterations in their neurodevelopment is the visible part of a problem that originates in pregnancy. Reducing the number of vulnerable children depends on health policies and, above all, on improving the living conditions of the population. These are long-term actions. Knowing in depth the risk factors that can trigger unexpected death is what can be done now. The update of the recommendations on safe sleep reflects new knowledge based on scientific evidence and a comprehensive approach to the sociocultural aspects related to this problem.La muerte súbita de un lactante puede ser de causa explicada, indeterminada –si no se investigó en forma suficiente– o inexplicada –cuando una investigación completa no permite determinar su causa–. La muerte súbita inexplicada, o síndrome de muerte súbita infantil, afecta en particular a las poblaciones más vulnerables. La muerte de estos niños que nacen con alteraciones del neurodesarrollo es la parte visible de una problemática que se origina en el embarazo. Disminuir la cantidad de niños vulnerables depende de políticas de salud y, sobre todo, de lograr mejorar las condiciones de vida de la población. Son acciones a largo plazo. Conocer a fondo los factores de riesgo que pueden desencadenar la muerte inesperada es lo que se puede hacer ya. La actualización de las recomendaciones sobre sueño seguro refleja nuevos conocimientos basados en la evidencia científica y un enfoque integral de los aspectos socioculturales relacionados con esta problemática.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is one of the most common clinical syndromes of somnological disorders, including any sleep disorders under sufficient time and appropriate sleeping conditions. Significant sleep disturbances are common in children who enter the intensive care unit. Between 18 and 65 per cent of children aged between 2 and 18 hospitalized in the intensive care unit have a clinical condition of acute confusion, better known as delirium. Sleep fragmentation, reduction of total sleep time, lack of slow, deep sleep and rapid sleep, and shift of sleep time are changes that can also act as insomnia triggers. Their presence worsens the course of the disease in the patient, prolongs the hospital stay, and increases the risk of complications and lethality. Circadian sleep disorder is a condition that requires close monitoring. Although insomnia therapy approaches are not yet reliable, early diagnosis of insomnia can reduce the duration of the delirium. Sleep assessment includes questionnaires and diaries. However, it was recognized that, despite the difficulties in implementing and interpreting polysomnography, it was still a gold standard for more accurate detection of changes in sleep phases and the difference between normal and abnormal sleep. In the absence of a polysomnograph, it is permissible to use a prolonged video assisted EEG. The inventive multimodal video-assisted monitoring method makes it possible to diagnose sleep disorders, pain syndrome and differential diagnosis of apnoea with cardiac and conductivity disorders or abnormal brain activity, including the presence of sub-clinical convulsions in patients of high-risk groups using a safe and non-invasive method for analyzing trends in the total bioelectric activity of different biological structures of a child. The validation of questionnaires according to the age of the child is also an important step in the timely diagnosis of sleep disorders in older children.",

Frequent nocturnal awakening and associated behavioral and psychological symptoms in demented people place a heavy burden on their families and care givers, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern to health care practitioner and researchers. Although sleep disturbances in demented people could be classified into not only insomnia type but also irregular pattern type, differentiation has not yet been sufficiently practiced in a clinical setting. Demented people with irregular sleep pattern increase with progressive stage and are often insensitive to the usual pharmacotherapies for insomnia using benzodiazepines or antipsychotics. From the viewpoint of risk-benefit balance, chronotherapies such as artificial bright light or improvement of sleep hygiene could be useful and safety tools for sleep and behavioral problems in the demented elderly.",

Anyone can have such concerns for a time, but when it becomes a pervasive and enduring feature of one's way of dealing with the world, then this can constitute a paranoid personality disorder. Among mental health disciplines, there is consensual agreement reflected in the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM; the gold standard for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders) that a personality disorder is an enduring, inflexible pattern of behavior across a broad range of functional contexts that produces either clinically significant personal distress or disruption and impairment in a person's social, occupational, or “other important areas of functioning” (APA, 2000). The prevalence of paranoid personality disorder (PPD) has been estimated to range from 0.5–2.5% in the general population, to be four times more prevalent in outpatient psychiatric settings, and to occur 10–30% in inpatient psychiatric facilities (APA, 2000). It is also thought to be more prevalent among males. Though it is a comparatively uncommon condition, its impact can be pervasive. Many would agree that dramatic examples in history of paranoid personalities include Joseph Stalin and perhaps Saddam Hussein.",

      "abstract": "Dans le quotidien, l'être humain associe intuitivement un sommeil de bonne qualité au bon fonctionnement physiologique et psychologique. D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation.

Insomnia was significantly associated with working night shifts among Norwegian nurses [1]. Individual factors that are associated with insomnia among permanent night workers are older age, lower circadian adjustments, being married, having children, physical inactivity and excessive intake of caffeine [2]. Nurses working permanent night shifts frequently lament about problems in commencing and/or sustaining sleep, as well as a decline in sleep duration [3].

From 30 to 40 % of the population has presented insomnia at a certain moment of life and from 9 to 15 % have evolved into a chronic and severe insomnia. Recent investigations have related sleep deprivation with obesity, metabolic disorders, heart disease, mental health problems and dementia. Recently, more investigations have focused on the multiple alterations suffered by the immune system in cases of sleep deprivation. In order to make an opportune diagnosis of insomnia, it is vital to obtain a detailed history of the patients' sleep habits. In the physical exam one must search for signs and symptoms which might suggest an organic cause that generates the patient's insomnia. One of the pillars in treatment of these patients consists in acquiring an adequate sleep hygiene based on the optimization of the environment and the behavior that are associated with sleep.La magnitud que tiene el sueño en el bienestar integral de una persona es similar a los efectos de la dieta y el ejercicio. La privación del sueño tiene efectos deletéreos graves en la salud del individuo y por lo general estos son ignorados. Entre un 30 y un 40 % de la población ha presentado insomnio en algún momento de su vida y del 9 al 15 % ha desarrollado insomnio crónico grave. Diversos estudios vinculan la falta de sueño con obesidad, enfermedades metabólicas, problemas cardiacos, desórdenes psiquiátricos y demencia. Existen actualmente grupos que se enfocan en las alteraciones en la respuesta inmune que genera la falta de sueño. Para realizar un diagnóstico oportuno de insomnio, es indispensable que durante la consulta se obtenga una historia clínica detallada de los hábitos del sueño. En la exploración física se debe enfatizar la búsqueda de signos y síntomas que sugieran una causa orgánica específica que contribuya a la alteración del sueño. Uno de los pilares del tratamiento es establecer en todos los pacientes una buena higiene del sueño con base en la optimización del ambiente y de las conductas asociadas con el mismo.",

Pain stimuli disturb sleep and nonpainful stimuli [e.g., noise] that disrupt sleep [e.g., slow wave sleep] cause unrefreshing sleep, myalgia, and fatigue. Forced awakenings from sleep reduce pain inhibition and yields pain and nonpainful symptoms. Neurotransmitter dysfunctions, for example, central nervous system serotonin and substance P affect both sleep and pain. In clinical studies of FMS and CFS, unrefreshing sleep is associated with frequent periodic electroencephalogram arousals from sleep, i.e., the cyclical alternating pattern, sleep apneas, and periodic limb movements.Conclusions: These experimental and clinical findings have clinical and therapeutic implications in the assessment and management of FMS. Diurnal sleep/wake-related physiological studies provide objective evidence that further the understanding of FMS and chronic fatigue syndrome. Preliminary studies of novel treatments that aim to facilitate restorative sleep suggest a rationale for better management of FMS and related illnesses.",

As sleep is a function and not a structure, it is challenging to treat and prevent its complications. Sleep apnoea is one such complication, with serious and potentially life-threatening consequences. Local studies estimate that about 15% of Singapore's population is afflicted with sleep apnoea. The resulting sleep fragmentation may result in poor quality of sleep, leading to daytime sleepiness. Sleep apnoea may also be the underlying cause of high blood pressure, memory loss, poor concentration and work performance, motor vehicle accidents, and marital problems. Evaluation involves a sleep study, followed by patient education, and an individualised step-wise management approach should be explored. Many patients will require follow-up for a long period of time, as management options may not offer a permanent cure; other contributory causes may arise at different phases of their lives, compounded by genetic and hormonal issues, ethnicity and the modern hazards of a fast-paced society.",

In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

The important aspects of sleep are Rapid Eye movement (REM) sleep, Non- Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep and Dreaming. This review mentions the fundamental processes of sleep, the causes of sleep deprivation and dreaming. The physiological changes that occur through sleep are discussed along with medications aids in sleeping and the substances that affect or change the sleep pattern. The common factors associated with sleeplessness are emotional or mental tension, anxiety, depression, work problems, and an unsatisfactory sex life. Sleep medicine as a recent branch of medicine is reviewed as well as the use of Plant Medicine to deal with sleep disorders. Common substances used to induce sleep are hypnotic sedatives, and over the counter medications such as Benadryl and Nyquil. Alcohol is also used as a sleep aid. Herbal medicines are also commonly used as sleep aids. How sleep medication affects then biological pathways of man is emphasized (The Biochemistry of Sleep). Two hypothetical enzymes are proposed for the Biochemical Pathway starting with tryptophan and terminating in melatonin, a known sleep hormone. The two hypothetical enzymes proposed are 5-hydroxytryptophan synthetase and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase. The major problems associated with insufficient in the society is explained as well as the causes of sleep deprivation in this modern civilization. Some of the behavioral changes in the society that have contributed to sleep problems are shift work, increased work hours and extensive socialization.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Complaints about sleep are common in elderly adults. While changes in sleep architecture occur with normal aging, complaints about sleep are often related to pathological and treatable sleep disturbances. Primary sleep disturbances occurring in older adults include circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movements in sleep. Particularly in older adults, sleep disturbances are likely to represent a multifactorial syndrome in which medical illness, psychiatric illness, and medications play a role. Sleep complaints necessitate the attention of the clinician as they are associated with poor outcomes. Because treatment strategies differ depending on the etiology of the sleep disturbance, a careful and systematic approach to diagnosis is crucial. This chapter reviews the normal changes in sleep that occur with age and sleep disorders frequently seen in older adults including in those with major neurocognitive disorders/dementia. Diagnosis and treatment strategies are discussed.",

Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis. It has become obsolete, and does not cover the clinical forms of hypersomnia. We have deemed it desirable to make a classification based on clinical principles, with due consideration for etiology.",

Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor.

      "abstract": "Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is one of the most variable of all human disorders, with virtually all body systems affected in some way, and age at disease onset varies from fetal life to old age. The character of DM1-related excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is that of a persistent sleepiness unaffected by naps, the latter being long, unrefreshing and without any associated dream. This chapter presents the scores of DM1 patients with and without EDS on the eight Short-Form 36-item Health Survey subscales, a frequently used generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire. It describes the personality and cognitive characteristics of 200 DM1 patients with and without EDS. The chapter discusses the habitual sleep-wake schedule and sleep-related complaints of 200 DM1 patients with and without EDS. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), hypercapnia, and nocturnal desaturation are all frequent in DM1. Psychostimulant drugs are increasingly used to treat EDS in DM1.",

Sleep disturbances are also frequently reported following TBI, and may contribute to fatigue. Fatigue may also limit energy for social interactions and/or recreational pursuits, resulting in withdrawal, greater time spent at home and consequent social isolation. Fatigue may be a symptom of depression and depression in turn may cause sleep disruption and fatigue. Fatigue may be associated with muscle weakness or other changes or injuries in the peripheral nervous system. The subjective experience of fatigue is likely to be determined by the complex interaction of functional disability with lifestyle demands, which is difficult to quantify and idiosyncratic. Like fatigue, sleep disturbances have also been associated with pain, depression and anxiety. Bright Light Therapy represents another potential treatment for fatigue and daytime sleepiness.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

Orexin receptor antagonism, a new sleep-promoting paradigm: an ascending single-dose study with almorexant. Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2010, 87, 593-600. Targeting the Orexin System: A New Approach for Treating Insomnia Sleep is an essential part of our everyday lives that matters more than most people realize. Regulation of the sleep-waking cycle is complex, involving multiple neurological circuits and diverse endogenous molecules. Interplay among assorted neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems maintain the waking state. Sleep-onset is governed by the interacting forces of the sleep drive, which steadily increases with duration of waking and circadian fluctuations. Epidemiological and clinical studies have established that sleep disorders are common and often untreated. Insomnia, one of the most common sleep disorders among adults, is a symptom of difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or non-restorative sleep associated with impaired next-day functioning and an increased risk for accidents. Insomnia treatment continues to be dominated by benzodiazepines and related compounds, which are powerful sedatives that enhance the inhibitory action of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) in the brain. The hypocretins/orexins are recently-discovered peptides with a discrete localization in the lateral hypothalamus. A single gene encodes hypocretin, which is cleaved by proteolytic processing into two smaller peptides: hypocretin-1 (orexin A) and hypocretin-2 (orexin B). These neurons project throughout the entire brain and spinal cord, providing especially heavy innervation to forebrain and brainstem neuronal populations implicated in wakefulness. Hypocretin/orexin has been implicated in narcolepsy, a human sleep disorder. Two orexin receptor subtypes, OX1R and OX2R, have been cloned. They are serpentine G-protein coupled receptors that bind both orexins with low selectivity and are coupled functionally to Ca++ mobilization, probably through transient receptor potential channels. The hypocretin/orexin system plays an important role in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, especially in the maintenance of long, consolidated awake periods. Increased hypocretin/orexin activity has been observed during waking and at the end of sleep. Almorexant, a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, is a reversible, selective, orally active non-selective OX1 and OX2 receptor antagonist that inhibits functional consequences of OX1 and OX2 receptor activation, such as intracellular Ca++ mobilization. Almorexant promotes sleep in a dose-dependent manner in both healthy volunteers and in patients with primary insomnia. In a new single-dose study, Almorexant was administered in an ascending single-dose (1-1,000 mg) to evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. In this study, subjects showed no decrements on motor function or reactive time on the following day. No evidence of cataplexy or abnormal REM behavior was reported. However, new studies involving night-time administration in relation of Almorexan in patients with sleep disorders are necessary to explore the role of the hypocretin/orexin during the circadian cycle. Modulation of the sleep-wake cycle is very much a question of timing of dosing, so the development of dosage at the optimal time will be essential for this approach. On the other hand, most of the published compounds targeting the hypocretin/orexin system have been developed using radioliganddisplacement assays or simple functional assays (intracellular Ca++ release) in recombinant cells. Hypocretin/orexin signaling cascades operating in the central nervous system will allow the development of more specific assays and generate compounds to block or activate defined branches of the signaling cascades (e.g. MAP kinase cascades), potentially creating drugs with different efficacy profiles.",

Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants.

Look for numerous failed antidepressant trials, apparent tolerance to antidepressants that does not resolve with increased dose, and antidepressant-induced mania or mood cycle acceleration. Hypomania, hyperthymic temperament, or mood swings in a patient's history. Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence. Ask about periods of elevated mood or energy that might not fit formal DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomania--such as episodes that last only a day or two. Mood lability in younger patients can be especially dramatic and poorly demarcated. Irritable, hostile, or mixed features. Some patients show one or more hypomanic features, such as racing thoughts when depressed. Psychomotor retardation appears more common in bipolar I depression than in unipolar major depression. Psychomotor agitation, however, is more likely in bipolar II than in unipolar major depression. Loaded family history of mood swings, frank bipolar disorder, or affective illness.

EDS is not a disease rather it’s a serious symptom linked with various disorders.

OSA is claimed as the most common reason of EDS. OSA candidate present difficulty in breathing owing to defective pharyngeal dilator muscles that eventually obstruct the upper airways (UA). Blockage of airflow enforces them to wake up in night and wherein the patients are not aware of the constant arousals. Irregularity in breathing and deprived sleep leads them to be categorized as ‘sleepy patients’.

      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

      "title": "Significance of REM Sleep in Depression: Effects on Neurogenesis",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of sleep are typical of depression and are observed in between 50% and 90% of depressed subjects [1]. Most patients with depression complain of insomnia and have well-described sleep disruptions, which belong to the core symptoms of the disorder [2]. Sleep disorders in depression have stimulated many sleep studies and for many decades sleep research has been a major pillar of neurobiological investigations into depression’s cause, onset and course. Since 1960s polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides disturbances of sleep continuity a constellation of sleep EEG changes is present in depression [3,4]. Especially Rapid Eye Movement activity has been the favorite focus of sleep EEG studies in depression and studies on its significance indicate that a strong link exists between dysregulation of REM sleep, REM latency, REM density, and the cause, onset and course of major depressive disorders. These alterations might act as trait dependent marker of depression and have been considered biological marker for depression. Especially shortened REM sleep Latency might be both a prodrome of major depressive episodes [2] and a consequence or complication of depression [2,5]. In fact REM alterations often persist beyond the clinical episode indicating heightened vulnerability to depressive relapse or recurrence, negative affecting treatment response independent of treatment method [2,6]. Moreover because the majority of antidepressant irrespective of their chemical class suppress REM sleep, it has been hypothesized that REM sleep suppression might be considered a key mechanism underlying treatment response and might be considered necessary if an antidepressant effect is obtained. Recently REM deregulations have been described to have a role in the production of the core symptoms of mood disorder contributing to the core features of cognitive distortion including self-worth [7] and to negative emotional memories consolidation. Studies have in fact demonstrated that there is a failure of sleep dependent emotional brain processing in REM sleep in depression which seems to support the development of clinical depression [8]. In addition, REM sleep is physiologically abnormal in persons at risk for depression. In fact several high risk studies including healthy relatives of patients with depression have demonstrated that REM sleep, particularly REM density changes, are present before the disorder’s onset and predict its development.Several theoretical models have been developed to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression and they might be implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. Indeed Circardian Rhytm abnormalities have been hypothesized to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression i.e. the Two Process Model, “S-deficiency” [9] the “Phase-advance” hypothesis [10], genetically driven [11] and the “hypocretine deficit hypothesis” [12], REM sleep dysregualtion have been historically posed as a causal process of depression [13]. In fact the “Monoamine Hypothesis,”ACh-hypersensitivity” in depression indicate a key role of REM sleep dysregualtions as specific features of this disorder due to cholinergic hyperactivity [14] which might be under genetic control. More recently REM sleep dysregulation have been hypothesized to contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression. Recently McNamara et al. [7] suggest that one proximate mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern of hyperactive paralimbic/ ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) and hypoactive dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dPFC) in mood disorders might be “REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition” driven. A key role of REM sleep alterations in the pathogenesis of depression have been also indicated within the defect of brain maturation hypothesis. A novel concept for the etiology of depression proposes that a dysfunction of neural plasticity might represent a final common pathway underlying the biological and clinical characteristics of the disorder. Changes in neurogenesis might be linked to the pathophysiology of depression. In fact a decrease in neurogenesis has been shown in animal models of depression, and shift in brain plasticity might be stress related [15]. Recently it has been hypothesized that one mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern in mood disorders affecting neurogenesis is stress-related REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition [16,17]. Moreover available data favor the hypothesis that the increase of stress hormones, due to sleep loss of depression and REM-stress related affects adult neurogenesis and it may endanger hippocampal integrity [18], thereby leading to cognitive dysfunction and contributing to the development of mood disorders (allostatic load) [16,17]. REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by complex neurobiological modifications that involves noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic systems and the stress system which might affect adult neurogenesis and brain plasticity. Recently REM sleep alterations have been considered not only biological scars but true endophenotypes for depression [4,19]. In fact in the search of new “vulnerability markers” or “endophenotypes” for depression changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest.Concluding form historical studies to more recent ones we might hypothesized that REM sleep might play an important key role in depression onset, course, cognitive emotional symptoms, expression and treatment response. Moreover REM sleep dysregulation might contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression and are involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. Especially it seems that REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by host of genetic, neurochemical and neurobiological factors which might affect neurogenesis and brain plasticity of depressed patients. For all these evidences in the search of new “endophenotypes” changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest. Clearly REM sleep dramatically modulates physiological, emotional and cognitive states of the human",

Fibrositis patients had more alpha EEG sleep and less REM and Stage 1 sleep. They were better able to recall their behaviourally signalled awakenings the following morning and reported qualitatively less satisfying sleep than the normal controls.

      "title": "Ethical Issues in the Evaluation and Treatment of Depression",
      "abstract": "Clinical assessments for patients experiencing depression constitute one of the most common scenarios for psychiatrists practicing today.In fact, depressive disorders are estimated to affect more than 12% of Americans during their lifetimes, contributing to impairments in functional status and quality of life, in addition to costing the U.S. economy more than $43 billion annually (1, 2).The term depression, first appearing in the late 1600s, stems from the classical Latin verb deprimere, which translates literally as \"to press down,\" denoting a sensation of heaviness that one may feel when plagued by a sustained sad or \"down\" mood (3).When persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities, or both combine with other unremitting depressive symptoms, such as change in appetite, low energy, sleep difficulty, psychomotor fluctuation, feelings of worthlessness, poor concentration, or suicidal thoughts, a patient may be so impaired as to meet criteria for major depressive disorder (4).Depressive symptoms also factor into diagnoses such as bipolar I and II disorders, anxiety disorders, substance-induced mood disorders, and somatic symptom and related disorders.Mainstay treatments for depression include pharmacologic therapy with antidepressant and augmenting agents, psychotherapy for patients with mild to moderate depression, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients who are acutely psychotic, extremely suicidal, or unable to take medications (1).Newer treatments include transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, ketamine, and other NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonists aimed at targeting patients who might be initially categorized as treatment resistant (1, 5).Although the risk of relapse always lingers, properly treated depression helps patients to experience relief of symptoms and to resume active and fulfilling lives (5).The prevalence of depressive symptoms and the variety of available management options make the ethical considerations surrounding the evaluation and treatment of depression particularly compelling.These ethical imperatives include respect for law, beneficence, compassion, nonmaleficence, justice, veracity or honesty, confidentiality or privacy, fidelity, altruism, autonomy, and integrity (6, 7).This article aims to engage readers in an examination of some of the contexts in which these ethical principles may be encountered in common practice settings. Case Illustration 1Jeremy Saunders, a 19-year-old college student on vacation for spring break, is visiting his aunt, Dr. Rebecca Saunders.Dr. Saunders recently graduated from residency training and now practices full time as a psychiatrist at the local hospital in Miami.One morning over coffee, Jeremy confides to his aunt that he has been \"in a funk\" for quite some time.He relates that he is often unable to get out of bed before noon and that he rarely leaves the dorm when at school.Jeremy misses many of his classes and recently failed two midterm examinations.In addition, socializing with friends is increasingly difficult because he is \"afraid of bringing everybody down\" with his sad mood.Jeremy's appetite has decreased significantly during this time, and he describes the idea of food as having become \"nauseating.\"Even activities that used to interest him, such as composing lyrics, are no longer enjoyable.Jeremy states that he does not feel comfortable telling anyone else about his feelings.He hopes that now that his aunt has her medical license, she can prescribe a medication to help Jeremy \"get back on track and complete the semester.\"On further reflection, Dr. Saunders notes that her nephew seems to have lost weight since she last saw him a year ago and that he is having difficulty focusing on nightly chess games, which they used to enjoy together.She is concerned that her nephew might be experiencing a major depressive episode.1.1 Which of the following ethical principles supports Dr. Saunders' decision not to treat her nephew despite her concerns?",

If someone has been suffering various symptoms for some time, wondering what is going on with her body, the diagnosis can be a relief. Disbelief is an emotional reaction that may happen immediately on hearing the diagnosis, or later as a form of denial. There are feelings of despair, grief, and sadness. A feeling of upset and tears may occur at the time of being given a diagnosis, soon after, or soon after the initial shock has worn off. It may initially have been triggered by fear and the serious countenance of the patient's relatives or loved ones or the doctor concerned.",

Insomnia increases particularly as women approach and pass through menopause (7–10). Insomnia in postmenopausal women, part of the climacteric syndrome, can occur, on the one hand, in association with hormonal changes (11,12); on the other hand, women are more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders, such as major depression and anxiety disorders, which are also correlated with insomnia (5,13). Organic sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) resulting from a decrease of sex hormones in menopause may play an important role as well (14).",

The risk for sports injuries increases when athletes are sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation increases risk-taking behaviors, predisposing to injuries. SWDs are an independent risk factor for prolonged recovery after sports-related concussion.

The quality of life during the wakeful stage is heavily dependent on the quality of REM and non-REM sleep experienced, whether during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The most restorative sleep is delta sleep (slow wave sleep or deep sleep) that occurs in Stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep; it is during these stages that one is the most difficult to waken. Individuals waken during REM sleep, but the state of being awake is normally so brief that it is not recalled later when in the true wake state. Rapid eye movement and generalized muscle atonia are characteristic of REM sleep; diaphragmatic movements and erections are the only muscle movements not inhibited.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

Thus, chronic insomnia is associated with high levels of psychopathology and a personality profile characterized by internalization of emotions. Also, a greater number of stressful life events occurs at the year of onset of insomnia. Two additional sleep disorders (sleep-walking and night terrors in adults) are similarly associated with high levels of psychopathology. Although these two disorders share many common clinical and psychopathological characteristics, their psychological profiles and psychopathological correlates differ considerably. Sleepwalkers show a high incidence of personality disorders with generally active, outward behavioral patterns, whereas night terror sufferers are mostly anxious, depressed and phobic with an inhibition of outward expression of aggression. Based on these research findings a series of therapeutic recommendations is presented for the effective management of patients with insomnia, sleepwalking or night terrors.",

      "abstract": "We reviewed sleep and dream-related clinical symptoms in a set of four neurologic disorders (Parkinson’s Disease, REM Behavior Disorder, Narcolepsy and Depression) characterized by severe reductions in dopaminergic function. Sleep findings included excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), increased rapid eye movement sleep times (REM%), increased REM density or bursts of REMs, reduced REM latency periods, and sleep onset REM (SOREM). Clinical symptoms included perseverative or rigid thinking and personality styles, frontal lobe impairment, increased complaints of, or vulnerability to negative affect, and increased vivid and unpleasant dreams. The increased vulnerability to unpleasant dreams was particularly interesting as descriptions of dream content were strikingly similar across all 4 disorders. Dreams of feeling threatened or being attacked by animals or dangerous creatures were very frequent. We hypothesize that the cluster of sleep, dream and cognitive changes associated with these four disorders can be explained by assuming that lowered dopaminergic tone leads to a disinhibition of REM physiology and amygdalar activity and that this disinhibition of REM and amygdalar function yields unpleasant dreams, negative affect, and frontal lobe impairment. Careful study of the cluster of co-occurring symptoms identified here may illuminate 1) the ways in which dopamine might function in regulation of sleep states, and 2) aspects of the neurology of dream content.

      "abstract": "Autism and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that affect at least 3% of the school aged population. Both have serious secondary sequelae including anxiety and depression, problems with concentration in class, learning new concepts through relevant curriculums, and social communication. Sleep is crucial to healthy neurodevelopment. It is not just a period of rest, but a time when the brain is highly active. During sleep, the brain consolidates newly acquired information, organises memory, and can lay the basis for emotional memory. Within Autism and FASD (as well as in many other developmental and psychological conditions), sleep quality and quantity remain much lower than the average and necessary amount. It is not known why this is, but research suggests that there is a complex and bidirectional relationship between sleep and development. This relationship may be part of the compromise of atypical development. This thesis links sleep with a number of daytime outcomes in children with Autism and FASD. According to the research carried out as part of this thesis, sleep is connected to anxiety, behaviours such as aggression and withdrawal, cognitive aspects such attention and working memory, as well as social and environmental factors. This is apparent not only in children in the neurodevelopmental categories, but in typically developing children too. This research also finds that children with Autism and FASD experience more sleep problems than typically developing children. It is therefore proposed here that sleep health interventions should be strongly considered as part of the therapeutic practice for children with Autism and FASD.",

Common sleep issues include chronic insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, and sleep-disordered breathing. Diagnostic tools, such as a comprehensive sleep history and questionnaires, or a sleep log for more specific complaints, are commonly used. Polysomnography is not recommended as a routine test; however, it can be used for abnormal behaviors during sleep or if treatment fails. Sleep disorder management is based on the etiology and may include nonpharmacological and pharmacological alternative treatments. For example, nonpharmacological management for chronic insomnia and some sleep disorders may consist of cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene education, relaxation therapy, sleep restriction, light therapy, and stimulus control therapy. Because the quality of evidence for pharmacological treatment is poor, the medication choice should be based on shared decision-making between the practitioner and the patient, with limited prescription.",

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men.

      "abstract": "Several environmental factors play a role in the poor quality of sleep of hospitalized patients, such as noise pollution, nocturnal awakenings for the administration of medication or the taking of vital signs, the discomfort of the beds, the luminosity or even certain night-time equipment. To cope with these insomnia problems in the hospital setting, patients often request drug treatment, which leads to over-prescription of sedatives, such as benzodiazepines. This leads to serious side effects such as an increased risk of falling, confusion and respiratory depression. This hostile hospital environment must be taken into account before considering specific treatment.Plusieurs facteurs environnementaux jouent un rôle dans la mauvaise qualité du sommeil des patients hospitalisés, tels que les nuisances sonores, les réveils nocturnes pour l’administration de médicaments ou la prise de signes vitaux, l’inconfort des lits, la luminosité ou encore certains équipements nocturnes. Pour faire face à ces problèmes d’insomnie en milieu hospitalier, les patients sont souvent demandeurs d’un traitement médicamenteux, ce qui mène à une surprescription de sédatifs, tels que les benzodiazépines. Il s’ensuit des effets secondaires potentiellement dangereux comme un risque accru de chute, un état confusionnel ou encore une dépression respiratoire.

      "abstract": "Neonatal brain injuries represent a group of common yet heterogeneous disorders, which result in long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "title": "Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "The role of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia outcome",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

While the majority of women experience the “baby blues” as a result of hormonal fluctuations, postpartum depression symptoms persist, are more severe in nature, and require medical intervention. Baby blues are characterized by mood lability and sudden crying but most commonly last a few days and then resolve. Up to 70 percent of women experience a few days of baby blues which then resolves completely. Most women with PPD develop symptoms within four weeks of giving birth, though symptoms can occur anytime within the 12 months following delivery. Approximately 15 to 25 percent of women experience PPD following childbirth. Postpartum depression can occur as a result of a live birth, spontaneous abortion, elective termination, or a fetal demise. In the United States 2 million new mothers experience PPD annually. Certain factors reduce the risk of PPD, including adequate social support, regular sleep patterns, and breastfeeding.",

Often, patients are labeled as “confused,” and no further evaluation is performed to determine the cause. This is particularly an issue with elderly patients, whose confusion is often dismissed as dementia, and for those with terminal illness, whose confusion may be accepted as part of disease progression. Patients at highest risk for delirium include those who are elderly, in intensive care units, or postoperative, as well as those with advanced illnesses. This syndrome is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, leading to increased length of hospital and nursing home stays and risk for earlier death. The experience of delirium is frightening to both patients and their significant others; it impairs quality of living—and quality of dying. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to improve patient outcomes, especially in the final stages of an illness.",

The emotional content of both dreams is characterised by terror provoked by scary and torturing parental figures—instead of reassuring ones—and by the intense rag felt towards them. Dreaming is the final product of the activation of complex neural networks in several cognitive domains responsible for attention, memory, language in general, and sensorial perception and visual imagery. Neuroimaging techniques, during dreaming, show how the prototypical sensorimotor hallucinations, the hyper-emotionality, and the cognitive distortions are correlated with patterns of activations/deactivations of specific brain regions. The iconic language of dreams seems to be resistant, or resilient, to massive psychic trauma that is, verbally, by definition, \"mute\", but not blind.",

Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents. A comparative analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials in youth BD established that atypical antipsychotics have better efficacy and tolerability compared with anticonvulsants and lithium (effect size atypical antipsychotics 0.65, CI 0.53 to 0.78 vs …",

Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

The disasters most frequently associated with de­tri­men­tal consequences were those with an increased level of community destruction and those from developing coun­tries with lower socioeconomic status. Supportive group interventions are recommended in the first days after the trauma. There is no consistent evidence regarding the ef­fec­tive­ness of early psychopharmacological approaches. Me­dica­tion is recommended for symptoms’ im­prove­ment, especially in severe psychiatric symptoms that sig­ni­fi­cantly impair functioning. Cognitive-behavioral short-term interventions in the first two weeks after trau­ma, focused on education, anxiety management trai­ning, imaginary and in vivo exposure therapy and in cognitive restructuring, proved the most effective.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly.

Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.",

Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail, they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its constraints. However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems, leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of life. These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an underlying dementia.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "abstract": "Delirium is an acute onset, fluctuant, confusional state with cognitive, emotional, perceptual, psychomotor and sleep–wake cycle disturbances. It is often worse in the evening and at night, particularly with underlying dementia.1 Delirium is often not diagnosed due to fluctuating signs and symptoms. The most common clinical subtype in palliative care is hypoactive delirium, with reduced psychomotor activity.2 Delirium is especially common in palliative care, almost ubiquitous towards the end of life; up to 88% of patients develop delirium in the last weeks to hours of life.3 \n\nOlder age and dementia are major risk factors. Current and projected demographic changes, with an increased elderly population, signal a need for physicians to have a better awareness of delirium diagnosis and assessment. A high level of suspicion and multidisciplinary team involvement is needed in diagnosis and management.\n\nThe primary management is rapid diagnosis, as mortality increases with delay.

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) includes a constellation of symptoms, most prominently excessive daytime somnolence and unrefreshing sleep, associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The periodic respiratory events constituting SDB may be complete cessation of airflow (apneas), reductions in airflow of various degree (hypopneas), increased respiratory \"effort\" events with no increase in airflow (flow limitation events), or a combination of these events occurring at various times during the sleep period. Unrefreshing sleep and excessive daytime somnolence are thought to be because of disruption of the normal sleep architecture from recurrent brief arousals associated with the respiratory events, usually resulting in reduced \"deep\" (slow wave) and rapid eye movement sleep. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation, often severe, usually accompanies the respiratory events and may be a major factor in the cardiovascular morbidity associated with OSAHS. However, this satisfyingly simple and logical construct for OSHAS is likely an oversimplification. The lack of universally accepted criteria for defining a specific disease entity and the lack of certainty about the causal relationship of the various types of respiratory events and associated arousals/desaturations with symptoms and the pathophysiological consequences, limit the understanding of the prevalence, risk factors, and natural history of clinically important SDB.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia defined by intermittent loss of electromyographic atonia during REM sleep with emergence of complex and vigorous behaviors. Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;257:1786-1789)",

Environmental factors, such as light exposure, noise from diverse sources, and sleep interruptions related to patient care, have all received considerable investigational attention. Critical illness can affect elements involved in sleep initiation and maintenance. The various modes of mechanical ventilation may have different effects on sleep fragmentation and on the propensity to cause central apnoeas, thereby potentially prolonging the time on the ventilator. Pharmacologic agents, especially sedatives, can directly affect sleep architecture and may contribute to the incidence of intensive care unit delirium.

The diagnosis of narcoleptic syndrome is established by the history of recurrent daily short sleep attacks in combination with cataplexy, brief episodes of loss of muscle tone and paralysis. Narcolepsy often results from monotony, and cataplexy is usually due to a sudden increase in alertness, with laughter or surprise. About one-half of all subjects also have sleep paralysis, and many describe vivid dreams at sleep onset, or even during wakefulness. In classic cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the history, and also from the finding of at least two sleep-onset REM periods during a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The MSLT gives an index of daytime drowsiness, with measurement of the time of sleep onset at 2-h intervals on five occasions throughout the day.",

      "title": "Current Problems in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA QUENTIN R. REGESTEIN* and PETER REICHf Recently, interest has grown in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Over 2 decades of laboratory research have yielded information that may further rationalize treatment ofdisordered sleep. Reviews have appeared discussing newer understanding and treatments for sleep problems [1, 2], and attempts are being made to forge standardized classifications for sleep disorders. Special clinics for the management of these problems are now being organized upon the notion that greater specificity in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders is at hand. Insomnia is perhaps the most common sleep disorder faced by physicians . Insomnia must be distinguished from lack of sleep. Only a tinyfraction of insomniacs is ever objectively examined for the amount of sleep actually obtained, and such examinations when done last but 1 or 2 nights. The results of the examination, when done, are not always consistent with the patient's estimation of sleep loss, yet the patient may continue to complain of insomnia in the absence of objective substantiation ofsleep loss and persist in his demands for relief. For these reasons, we define insomnia as the complaint of sleep loss. Despite the years of clinical experience in treating insomnia and the added understanding of sleep more recently accrued from research, there remain several problems that prevent agreement on how to classify insomnia. Specificity in diagnosing and treating insomnia is therefore hindered. This paper is meant to articulate these problems in order to reconcile for the practitioner the broad, prolonged clinical experience accumulated with insomnia and the relative lack of specificity for its treatment. We will attempt to describe some of the difficulties surround- *Sleep Clinic, Division of Psychiatry, Department of Medicine, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, 721 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; associate in medicine and assistant professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School. tPhysician, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital; and associate professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School.© 1978 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/78/2102-0006S01.00 232 I Quentin R. Regestein and Peter Reich ¦ Chronic Insomnia ing both the diagnosis and the treatment of insomnia, in order, we hope, to guide further attempts to understand and relieve insomnia patients. Diagnosis Five percent of adult patients from a general medical practice presented complained of insomnia [3], 20 percent in a similar group admitted some sort of sleep disturbance [3], and 45 percent of adults in an epidemiological survey reported difficulties in falling asleep or staying asleep [4]. This remarkable prevalence may contribute to the lack of systematic classification for insomnia. Chronic insomnia is so common that some may consider it a normal experience rather than a pathological problem [5]. Although chronic insomnia may signify severe mental or physical derangement and correlate with augmented death rates [6], much insomnia is mild and temporary. A complaint that subsides rather than persists excites little interest. Nevertheless, much insomnia remains chronic, poses great difficulty for patient and practitioner, and still remains unclassified. The frequency of psychopathology among insomniac patients provides a second reason why insomnia has not been classified. Insomnia can stem from mental problems of all kinds, and many of these are not rapidly treatable. Chronic insomniacs are said to be complaining, oversensitive people [7]. In two series ofinsomnia patients, over 85% ofthose 274 subjects tested showed pathological scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an elevation in the depression scale being most common [8, 9]. Even poor sleepers, discovered through research questionnaires rather than through clinical practice, prove to be anxious, depressed, obsessively worried types [10]. Furthermore, many insomniac patients depend on drugs [H]. Chronic insomnia, therefore, associated with chronic psychological troubles and complicated by drug abuse, may be considered an unattractive problem by many physicians. In these respects it resembles alcoholism by inviting disproportionately small clinical interest. Perhaps, for this reason, characterizing insomnia has recently been left to the psychiatrists, even though prescribing for insomnia is done mostly by other physicians [12]. Certain difficulties arise whenever conditions involving much psychopathology are categorized. The rich diversity of personalities and psychological disorders are not neatly categorized. They are, furthermore , enmeshed in the unique complexity of behavioral traits that characterize every person. Psychiatric nosology, therefore...",

They may also characterize some frontal or temporal nocturnal seizures of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, or be considered as part of NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking, sexsomnia or sleep-related eating disorder, or REM-related behaviors such as REM behavior disorder or complex movements associated with pediatric narcolepsy type I. In most cases rhythmic movements, especially when complex and long in duration, are related to different levels of arousal from sleep with recurrence of ancestral motor sequences promoted by central pattern generators in the brainstem, generally activated by the arousal process. A differential diagnosis between physiological events and pathological movement disorders, and between the latter and sleep-related epilepsy is critical to provide optimal treatment and an accurate prognosis. Specific treatment options for the aforementioned disorders are beyond the scope of this article.",

      "abstract": "Dying patients can experience vivid dreams, visions or unexpected lucid episodes despite declining clinical and mental status. This review examines patient end-of-life experiences (ELEs) and their implications to the mind-brain relationship (MBR). A Scoping Review (ScR) was conducted, searching major academic databases for qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods studies. Data were synthesized narratively and presented in distribution graphs. Twenty-one papers (20 studies) were included from 1,391 citations, mostly U.S.-based (52%) and descriptive in nature. End-of-life dreams and visions (ELDVs) occur in cognitively intact dying patients, are vividly recalled, often feature deceased loved ones, offering meaning, comfort, and acceptance, suggesting sustained psychological and spiritual activity despite physical decline. Terminal lucidity (TL), though rarer, is a striking phenomenon, marked by the sudden reemergence of clarity, memory, and communication in severely cognitively impaired individuals across various pathologies, challenging the assumption that consciousness is solely a product of brain function. Patient ELEs suggest a possible mind-brain dissociation in the dying process. As research on ELDVs and TL continues to expand, future rigorous studies incorporating clinical controls and neuroimaging will be essential in determining whether these experiences are solely brain-generated or indicative of a broader understanding of consciousness beyond the brain.",

Breakdown in speech production occurs in many dementias, such as motor neurone disease with dementia. Many find the classification of speech disorders difficult.

      "abstract": "Behavioural problems are usually influenced by both biological and environmental factors. Disruptive behavioural problems such temper tantrums or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are displayed during the first years of childhood. Breath-holding attacks are relatively common and are an important problem. Although the attacks are not serious and the prognosis is usually good, parents often fear that their child may die during an attack. Parents therefore require explanation and reassurance from health professionals. Conduct disorders (often referred to as antisocial behaviours), such as aggression to others or theft, are more serious as they tend to be repetitive and persistent behaviours where the basic rights of others are violated. Emotional problems, such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder tend to occur in later childhood, and are often unrecognised because young children often find it difficult to express their emotions, or it may go unnoticed by the child's parents. This article briefly discusses the most common behavioural problems, including autism, that affect children of all ages.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

The core feature of social phobia is marked and persistent fear of embarrassment or humiliation in social situations where the individual worries that others may judge his or her performance as too much or too little. Anticipatory anxiety and avoidance occur when the individual is under scrutiny while speaking or performing publicly, eating with others, writing in public, or using public bathrooms. Diagnosis of social phobia is based largely on history obtained from the patient. Onset is usually around puberty; its course is chronic with comorbid depression common and alcohol and other substances routinely abused in misguided attempts to minimize anxiety and depressive symptoms. At examination, patients often have a moist hand, averted gaze, blushing, and other manifest signs of anxiety. Slight shyness is familiar to most, but a substantial number suffer dysfunctional and distressing social anxiety to the point that they become phobic. A few patients satisfy criteria for avoidant personality disorder, which can be socially incapacitating.",

This begins with a complete history and physical examination, followed by laboratory testing such as polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and actigraphy. The treatment of sleep disorders caused by co-morbid conditions is discussed under seven categories, including the use of general measures (e.g., sleep hygiene, encouraging patients to develop good sleep habits, medication), treatment of the co-morbid condition, treatment of insomnia, treatment of excessive daytime somnolence, treatment of parasomnias, treatment of sleep-wake schedule disorders, and treatment of secondary or symptomatic restless legs syndrome.",

The latter is characterized by a severe worsening of breathlessness intensity or unpleasantness beyond usual fluctuations in the patient's perception. Breathlessness is a common symptom in the general population with higher prevalence in older age, female sex, and chronic malignant and non-malignant conditions. Breathlessness—the uncomfortable awareness of the need to breathe—is a complex, individual experience of the mind and the body. As breathlessness is causing dysfunctional breathing with excessive accessory muscle use and upper chest dominance, readaptation of breathing patterns is essential in breathlessness management. Deconditioning due to physical activity also leads to breathlessness and peripheral muscle weakness.",

      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Syncope in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Syncope is defined as a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness associated with loss of postural tone and should be differentiated from other states of altered consciousness such as cardiac arrest, coma, narcolepsy, seizures, dizziness, and vertigo. Although multiple studies have focused on the diagnostic workup and on the prognosis of patients with syncope,1-5 data on the evaluation and outcome of elderly patients are only recently being reported.6, 7 Establishing a cause of syncope is frequently difficult. There are at least three possible reasons for the inability to define a cause of syncope. One, abnormalities causing syncope are frequently episodic or isolated events and may not be found at initial evaluation. Two, the diagnostic criteria for causes of syncope may be too stringent, leading to underdiagnosis. Three, many patients evaluated after the syncopal event may not recall the details surrounding their episode. If witnesses are not present, valuable observations are lost and the cause of syncope may not be apparent. Additionally, the evaluation of syncope in the elderly is especially more difficult because the elderly often have multiple coexisting diseases, maybe taking multiple medications, and have age-related physiologic changes that can predispose to syncope. Elderly noninstitutionalized patients have on the average 3.5 chronic diseases8 including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disorders, all of which can predispose to syncope. Older patients are reported to take three times as many drugs as the general population,9 and many of these medications may make persons susceptible to syncope. Additionally, age-related physiologic changes may alter the normal homeostatic mechanisms maintaining blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Baroreceptor sensitivity decreases with age and the heart rate increase in response to upright posture, exercise, cough, and hypoxia may be blunted.10, 11 Furthermore, aging results in a diminished ability of the kidneys to conserve sodium when intake is restricted and plasma renin and aldosterone responses may be diminished in the elderly, leading to difficulties in maintaining extracellular fluid balance.12 As previously emphasized,13 multiple pathologic processes together may result in syncope in the elderly and occasionally it may be difficult to specifically assign a single entity as its cause. We have recently analyzed the data from our prospective syncope study in order to compare the diagnosis and prognosis of 210 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years; range, 60 to 90 years) to 190 younger patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 14 to 59 years).6 Patients in this study were accrued from the inpatient and outpatient services of the Presbyterian-University Hospital, Pittsburgh, from April 1981 through September 1983 and all underwent a standardized diagnostic evaluation.2, 6 In our elderly patients, as noted in Table 1, initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (EKG) were useful in assigning a diagnosis in the majority of the patients in whom a cause could be found. Furthermore, in the elderly, diagnosis assigned by electroencephalogram, carotid massage, cardiac catheterization, cerebral angiogram, and stress test were suggested by findings on the initial history and physical examination. These results in the elderly are similar to previous studies which have shown that a careful initial history and physical examination is the most important step in the evaluation of patients with syncope.1-3 Previous studies, however, have also shown that in a substantial number of patients a cause of syncope cannot be established after the initial history, physical examination, and EKG. Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring has assumed a central role in the evaluation of this group of patients. Although in our study6 arrhythmias were more frequently diagnosed, and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring more often led to a diagnosis in the elderly, there are many issues regarding the use of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring that are not resolved. First, there is poor correlation between symptoms found during monitoring and concurrent electrocardiographic findings.14-16 Symptoms of dizziness or syncope during monitoring occur in 29 to 42% of patients.14-16 We have reported that a rhythm disturbance could not be identified during 75% of symptomatic periods.15 Arrhythmias may be excluded as a cause if the patient has syncope during monitoring, but no concurrent rhythm disturbance. However, most patients do not have syncope during monitoring. Therefore, presumptions regarding the cause of syncope based on asymptomatic findings are frequently necessary because of the prognostic importance and sporadic nature of the arrhythmias. However, high prevalenece of cardiac arrhythmias has been reported in asymptomatic elderly patients. Therefore, in elderly patients with syncope, it has been difficult to be certain which arrhythmias should be considered significant indicators for a potential cause of loss of consciousness. Validation of the criteria used by different investigators will be needed with long-term follow-up using recurrence of symptoms and mortality as endpoints. Second, the optimal duration of electrocardiographic monitoring has not been determined. One study suggested that patients should be continuously monitored until the symptoms recur.17 This approach is impractical and not cost-effective. We are currently evaluating the optimal duration of monitoring in patients with syncope. Third, the yield of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring is variable, showing transient arrhythmias as a potential cause of syncope in 10 to 64% of patients.18-23 Clinical predictors are needed to help identify patients more likely to have diagnostic findings. Because of the limitations of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, electrophysiologic studies have been advocated for use in the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope.24 These studies, however, consist of invasive and expensive diagnostic tests which are useful in the evaluation of very selected subgroups of patients with syncope, such as patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause “who have underlying organic heart disease. These tests may not be practical in many elderly patients who are frail, have multiple chronic medical illnesses, and who may not be able to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. A large number of abnormalities are reported on electrophysiologic studies but the diagnostic importance of many of these in terms of a cause of syncope is not well established. Although sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia, markedly prolonged H-V interval (greater than 80 m), and markedly prolonged sinus node recovery time are important findings in patients with unexplained syncope, the clinical significance of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, mildly prolonged H-V interval or sinus node recovery time, and induction of supraventricular tachycardia is not clear. Morbidity and mortality from syncope in the elderly may be different than the young. Injury after a fall in the elderly may have important ramifications in terms of the medical and psychological well-being of the elderly. Although there are no prior studies regarding injury due to syncope, studies on falls in the elderly reveal a higher incidence of bone fractures with advancing age.25 Approximately one-third of our patients had an injury due to a fall, but falls resulted in major trauma more frequently in the elderly. Bone fractures may be more likely to occur in the elderly because of their higher prevalence of osteoporosis. In addition, if premonitory symptoms are present, younger patients may be able to react more quickly and assume a supine or sitting position to avoid a severe injury. The mortality in our study was higher in the elderly as a reflection of deaths due to many underlying illnesses such as malignancies and pneumonia.6 In addition, more deaths in the elderly resulted from cardiovascular diseases such as chronic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease. Elderly patients in our study also had a higher incidence of sudden death. A multivariate analysis of our data6 revealed that patients with a cardiovascular cause of syncope are at exceedingly high risk of mortality and sudden death regardless of age. In patients with a noncardiovascular cause of syncope or syncope of unknown origin, older age, a history of congestive heart failure, and male sex were important risk factors for mortality and sudden death. Recent studies on syncope in conjunction with our study in the elderly6 provide a framework for the evaluation of elderly patients with syncope. These studies show that a careful history and physical examination will help establish many of the causes of syncope and may suggest many of the cardiac or non-cardiac causes that require further testing for definitive diagnosis. An EKG and electrocradiographic monitoring should be done in patients in whom a cause is not found on initial history and physical examination. In selected patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause who have organic heart disease, electrophysiologic studies may provide evidence for possible cause of syncope, but further studies are needed to define the risk and benefit of this test in elderly patients. Other diagnostic tests should be used selectively. Our studies have shown that nongoal-directed use of head computed tomography scan, electroencephalogram, and glucose tolerance test establish few if any causes of syncope.1, 2, 6 Elderly patients have higher morbidity and mortality than the young. A systematic and meticulous evaluation for cause of syncope in the elderly is needed in the hope of decreasing recurrences, morbidity, and the incidence of sudden death.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is clinically associated with cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. It is treated by reassurance (that there is no physical disease) and by stimulants such as ephedrine and amphetamine on an intermittent basis. The special tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is also used, and mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are useful in theory. Obstructive sleep apnoea is an important and often unrecognised cause of daytime somnolence. It is treated by weight reduction (pickwickian syndrome), hormones, or recently, with continuous positive pressure apparatus. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) and sleepwalking typically occur during deep sleep (stage 3 and 4 throughout the episode) in children. In a night terror the child sits up with a scream, with eyes open, but inaccessible. He eventually falls asleep calmly. Sleepwalking, too, shows the features of inaccessibility and subsequent amnesia for the episode. Both conditions are normally treated with reassurance (to the parents) but may occasionally warrant benzodiazepines. Enuresis usually occurs in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, especially stages 3 and 4. The reason for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants is not precisely known. Delirium tremens (DT) is treated as a rebound excess of REM sleep, with benzodiazepines and other drugs. It is the withdrawal syndrome (with or without major seizures) to the barbiturate-alcohol group of drugs, which includes alcohol, chloral, paraldehyde, glutethimide, methylprylone, ethchlorvynol, meprobamate and meprobamate-diphenhydramine. Insomnia may be treated by the above drugs, by analgesics, antidepressants, major tranquillisers (neuroleptics) and miscellaneous other compounds. For the majority of patients, however, the most suitable group seems to be the benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepines are much safer than their predecessors, in both acute and chronic usage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and sleep disorders: links, risks, and management challenges",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Schizophrenia is a major psychiatric disorder that has a massive, long-lasting negative impact on the patients as well as society. While positive symptoms (i.e., delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (i.e., anhedonia, social withdrawal), and cognitive impairments are traditionally considered the most prominent features of this disorder, the role of sleep and sleep disturbances has gained increasing prominence in clinical practice. Indeed, the vast majority of patients with schizophrenia report sleep abnormalities, which tend to precede illness onset and can predict an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, schizophrenia patients often have a comorbid sleep disorder, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or periodic limb movement disorder. Despite accumulating data, the links between sleep disorders and schizophrenia have not been thoroughly examined, in part because they are difficult to disentangle, as numerous factors contribute to their comorbidity, including medication status. Additionally, sleep disorders are often not the primary focus of clinicians treating this population, despite studies suggesting that comorbid sleep disorders carry their own unique risks, including worsening of psychotic symptoms and poorer quality of life. There is also limited information about effective management strategies for schizophrenia patients affected by significant sleep disturbances and/or sleep disorders. To begin addressing these issues, the present review will systematically examine the literature on sleep disorders and schizophrenia, focusing on studies related to 1) links between distinct sleep disorders and schizophrenia; 2) risks unique to patients with a comorbid sleep disorder; and 3) and management challenges and strategies.

      "title": "Sleep problems in children with dyslexia: understanding the role of sleep in neurocognitive development through the lens of developmental disorders",
      "abstract": "It has long been recognised that sleep is more than a passive recovery state or mere inconvenience. Sleep plays an active role in maintaining a healthy body, brain and mind, and numerous studies suggest that sleep is integral to learning and memory. The importance of sleep for cognition is clear in studies of those experiencing sleep deprivation, who show consistent deficits across cognitive domains in relation to nonsleep-deprived controls, particularly in tasks that tax attention or executive functions 1. Poor sleep has been associated with poor grades, and academic performance suffers when sleep is sacrificed for extra study 2. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that children with developmental disorders of learning and cognition often suffer from sleep disturbances. These have been well documented in children with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where sleep problems can be particularly severe. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that sleep can be atypical across a spectrum of learning disorders. Understanding the ways in which sleep is affected in different developmental disorders can not only support the design and implementation of effective assessment and remediation programs, but can also inform theories of how sleep supports cognition in typical development. The study by Carotenuto et al. 3 in this issue makes a valuable contribution to this literature by looking at sleep disturbances in children with developmental dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most common specific learning disorder, affecting around one in 10 children in our classrooms. It is characterised by difficulties with reading and spelling and is primarily caused by a deficit in phonological processing. However, dyslexia often co-occurs with other developmental disorders, such as ADHD and specific language impairment, and there can be striking heterogeneity between children. This has led to the suggestion that dyslexia can result from complex combinations of multiple risk factors and impairments 4. Consequently, research attention is turning towards the wider constellation of subclinical difficulties often experienced by children with dyslexia, including potential sleep problems. Two preliminary studies have found differences in the sleep architecture of children with dyslexia in comparison with typical peers, using overnight sleep EEG recordings (polysomnography) 5, 6. Notably, children with dyslexia showed unusually long periods of slow wave sleep and an increased number of sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep and spindles are related to language learning, most notably through promoting the consolidation of new vocabulary 7. Children with dyslexia have pronounced deficits in learning new oral vocabulary, providing a plausible theoretical link between sleep disturbances and language difficulties. If sleep problems do in fact exacerbate the learning difficulties associated with dyslexia, as well as impacting on daily cognitive function, this could have important implications for intervention and support programs. However, an important first step is to establish the nature and extent of sleep disturbances in dyslexia. Previous studies 5, 6 have used small samples (N = <30) and examined a large array of sleep parameters on a small number of unusual nights (where children were wearing sleep recording equipment), as opposed to looking at global patterns over time. As such, how representative these findings are is questionable, and consequently these studies should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. Carotenuto et al. 3 address some of these concerns, administering questionnaire measures of sleep habits to the parents of 147 children with dyslexia and 766 children without dyslexia, aged 8–12 years. A sample of this size allows for a robust analysis of sleep characteristics. Therefore, their findings that children with dyslexia showed higher rates of several markers of sleep disorders lend significant weight to suggestions that dyslexia might be associated with an increased risk for sleep problems. Importantly, the sleep questionnaire used by Carotenuto et al. 3 allows for a breakdown of sleep disturbances. It is interesting to note that they found the greatest difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep breathing disorders and disorders of arousal. This closely mirrors the types of sleep problem documented in children with ADHD 8. While Carotenuto et al. 3 took care to exclude children with comorbid diagnoses, many children with dyslexia show subtle features of attention disorders that do not reach clinical thresholds. Future studies that can establish whether sleep disturbances are associated with subclinical attention problems or dyslexia per se will be particularly informative for understanding which cognitive skills most critically relate to sleep. This is also vital information for establishing whether information about sleep habits could have clinical relevance in the assessment and management of children with dyslexia. There are a number of ways in which Carotenuto et al.'s findings could be taken forward in future studies. Not least, the findings need to be replicated using more objective measures of sleep, including polysomnography and/or actigraphy, both of which can be administered in the home environment. It is notable that neither of the two polysomnography studies to date observed differences in sleep onset time or night-time awakenings in children with dyslexia compared with typical peers. Although this could be a result of a lack of statistical power due to the very small samples in these studies, the discrepancy could also be due to the subjective nature of the questionnaires used. Future studies must also take care to recruit samples that are free of referral bias. Carotenuto et al. recruited their sample via referrals to a hospital clinic; hence, it is possible that such children may be more likely to present with multiple issues (including sleep problems), rather than reading difficulty alone. Thus, it will be important to examine the prevalence of sleep difficulties in referred and nonreferred samples. Although Carotenuto et al. make substantial progress in establishing the frequency of sleep disorders in dyslexia, the study design cannot test causal hypotheses or establish whether there was a link between sleep difficulties and severity of reading impairment. Indeed, a great challenge in the field of sleep and developmental disorders is establishing the extent to which sleep is causally related to cognitive difficulties. It is possible that brain abnormalities associated with disorders can cause both cognitive and sleep differences without them being directly linked to each other. Moreover, sleep difficulties may simply be a consequence of increased anxiety associated with having a developmental disorder. Randomised controlled trials are often viewed as the gold standard means of establishing causality. For example, a recent study has shown that a sleep intervention for children with ADHD led to significant improvements in ADHD symptomatology and working memory 9. Given that the type of sleep problems encountered by children with dyslexia are similar to those in ADHD, it is tempting to propose that such an intervention may prove useful for children with dyslexia. However, it is important to be cautious: only 42% of the children with dyslexia in the Carotenuto et al. study suffered sleep difficulties. This indicates that while having dyslexia seems to greatly increase a child's risk of sleep problems, sleep disturbances are unlikely to represent a causal pathway to reading difficulties. Therefore, it is unlikely that a sleep intervention would be useful for all individuals with dyslexia. Nonetheless, it remains plausible that sleep difficulties could exacerbate cognitive and literacy difficulties in some children, who might then benefit from clinical intervention. If this is the case, then such interventions should be seen as complementary to literacy-targeted interventions that tackle the reading difficulty itself. Further research is needed to ascertain whether and how sleep difficulties contribute to the difficulties experienced by children with dyslexia, and to establish which children with dyslexia are at the greatest risk of sleep disturbances. Understanding the role of sleep in developmental disorders is vital, not only to improve assessment and treatment for affected children and families, but also to advance theoretical models of sleep and neurocognitive development. While sleep problems are common in several neurodevelopmental disorders, these problems are likely to differ qualitatively and quantitatively across children with different difficulties. Therefore, it is important to study sleep problems within each learning disorder as well as to look at the heterogeneity across the spectrum of learning difficulties. Studies such as the one by Carotenuto et al., which looks specifically at sleep in dyslexia, are crucial in this regard, raising awareness of the possible role of sleep difficulties and opening up a plethora of potential lines of future research in this area.",

      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

Le concept de remission fonctionnelle a pris de l'importance dans notre societe ces dernieres annees. L'aptitude a la reprise de travail en fait partie. De nombreux facteurs peuvent influencer la remission fonctionnelle d'un episode depressif majeur en remission clinique partielle comme les symptomes cliniques residuels de la depression (symptomatologie anxieuse, troubles du sommeil...), les comorbidites (psychiatriques / somatiques eventuelles), la prise d'un traitement antidepresseur, les evenements professionnels, les troubles cognitifs residuels de la depression (deficit des fonctions executives, deficits attentionnels, ralentissement psychomoteur). Ce travail a explore l'Influence de la Cognition Sociale et plus specifiquement de la Theorie de l'Esprit sur la remission fonctionnelle de la depression et l'aptitude professionnelle, au travers d'une etude comparative de 30 patients en remission partielle d'un episode depressif majeur, repartis en deux groupes en fonction de leur statut professionnel.

Parasomnias can contribute to impaired academic or occupational performance, disturbances of mood and social adjustment. Identification of the presence of any psychological trauma or history of such trauma is important when trying to understand the possible sources of parasomnia. There is a predisposition to sleep-related dissociative disorder in victims of physical or sexual abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Secondary sleep enuresis is also noted in these patients. This chapter begins with a thorough history-taking, keeping in mind the Parasomnia Classification in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd edition (ICSD-2) and the differential diagnosis of abnormal behaviors and events during sleep. Seizures should always be considered in the differential of parasomnias, and formal EEG studies should be performed with appropriateness.",

In addition there are several times as many unsuccessful suicide attempts and attempted homicides, mayhems, and serious assaults and batteries. It is safe to say that a large portion of these involve persons with psychiatric disorders and thus fall under medical jurisdiction. Some of these individuals are overtly psychotic: deluded and hallucinated, or uncontrollably depressed, or assailed by intolerable anxiety, guilt, or hostile feelings. More are acutely neurotic, and their acts may be seen as manipulative gestures, or cries for help, or acting-out maneuvers. A large portion have disordered personalities and faulty character structures, often with alcoholism, narcotic addiction, sexual psychopathy, passive-aggressive disturbance, or emotional immaturity, instability, or inadequacy. Frequent accompaniments are adolescent turmoil, marital discord, school or work problems, chronic or terminal illness, or geriatric disease. Thus the physician has usually been consulted before",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infertility is a reproductive system condition defined by the failure to carry a clinical pregnancy following a period of 12 months or more of unprotected regular intercourse. Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

      "title": "Is there a dissociative process in sleepwalking and night terrors?",
      "abstract": "Abstract The enduring and contentious hypothesis that sleepwalking and night terrors are symptomatic of a protective dissociative mechanism is examined. This is mobilised when intolerable impulses, feelings and memories escape, within sleep, the diminished control of mental defence mechanisms. They then erupt but in a limited motoric or affective form with restricted awareness and subsequent amnesia for the event. It has also been suggested that such processes are more likely when the patient has a history of major psychological trauma. In a group of 22 adult patients, referred to a tertiary sleep disorders service with possible sleepwalking/night terrors, diagnosis was confirmed both clinically and polysomnographically, and only six patients had a history of such trauma. More commonly these described sleepwalking/night terrors are associated with vivid dream-like experiences or behaviour related to flight from attack. Two such cases, suggestive of a dissociative process, are described in more detail. The results of this study are presented largely on account of the negative findings. Scores on the dissociation questionnaire (DIS-Q) were normal, although generally higher in the small “trauma” subgroup. These were similar to scores characterising individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder. This “trauma” group also scored particularly highly on the anxiety,phobic, and depression scales of the Crown-Crisp experiential index. In contrast the “no trauma” group scored more specifically highly on the anxiety scale, along with major trends to high depressionand hysteria scale scores. Two cases are presented which illustrate exceptional occurrence of later onset of sleepwalking/night terrors with accompanying post-traumatic symptoms during wakefulness. It is concluded that a history of major psychological trauma exists in only a minority of adult patients presenting with sleepwalking/night terror syndrome. In this subgroup trauma appears to dictate the subsequent content of the attacks. However, the symptoms express themselves within the form of the sleepwalking/night terror syndrome rather than as rapid eye movement sleep related nightmares. The main group of subjects with the syndrome and with no history of major psychological trauma show no clinical or DIS-Q evidence of dissociation during wakefulness. The proposition that, within the character structure of this group, the mechanism still operates but exclusively within sleep remains a possibility.",

Of course, stress and sleep are linked in children too – relevant stressors documented in previous research include separations from key figures (e.g. parents, siblings, friends) as well as rarer events such as inhabiting war-zones (for a review, see Sadeh, 1996).\r\n\r\nWhile it is clear that stressful events and poor sleep can occur at the same time, what is less clear is whether stress experienced early in life is linked to sleep difficulties later on.

Approximately 20% of employed adults in the United States are engaged in shift work. Shift work sleep disorder is diagnosed if there is a report of insomnia or excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. Shift work is associated with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, and it has been implicated in weight gain and cognitive impairment. There is evidence of increased absenteeism in night workers compared with day workers. A planned sleep schedule, timed bright light exposure, timed melatonin administration, and stimulants or drugs promoting alertness can be used to manage shift work sleep disorder. Jet lag is characterized by a misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and local time caused by rapid travel across at least two time zones. Not all travelers experience jet lag; risk factors include age, number of time zones crossed, and circadian preference. Management includes timed melatonin along with optional timed and dosed bright light exposure.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "CHRONIC insomnia, like most symptoms, arises from many causes but, unlike most symptoms, attracts little diagnostic interest. Often, on complaining of sleeplessness, a patient promptly receives a prescription for hypnotics. Once regular use of hypnotics begins, giving them up becomes arduous. Regular use of hypnotics might be more reasonable were they more than temporarily effective. Unfortunately, however, chronic hypnotic use does not get the patient to sleep any faster,<sup>1</sup>but rather increases nightly awakenings, abolishes deep sleep,<sup>2</sup>and continues to affect sleep patterns for five weeks after drug withdrawal.<sup>3</sup>The ready drug prescriptions available, it seems, have not only led to a scourge of drug habituation, but may well have lessened the quality of sleep obtained by insomniac patients. Additionally, it has bolstered the unrealistic notion that one ought first to resort to drugs to alleviate chronic insomnia. The patient relying on hypnotics is often left with",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the most incapacitating forms of mental disorder that runs a chronic and relapsing course. It typically starts in adolescence or early adulthood and can be life-long. It is more common in people with learning disabilities than in the general population. Its prodromal features include depression, anxiety, suspiciousness, social isolation and bizarre behaviour. It may result in significant functional, social and economic impairments. The care of patients with schizophrenia places a considerable burden on all carers including patient's family, health and social services. Treatment includes pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. In this case report we describe a thirteen-year-old patient with schizophrenia who has a background history of mental retardation.",

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

We present a video report of a patient with a 1-year history of SRED caused by zolpidem causing important repercussions in the sleep structure and life quality. The night eating episodes ceased promptly with discontinuation of zolpidem. Upon the follow-up, the sleep structure improved and the daily consequences disappeared. As in few reported cases of zolpidem-induced SRED, our patient was suffering from the parasomnia for a long time before the diagnosis. Active exclusion of symptoms suggestive of SRED in patients under zolpidem treatment can avoid the deleterious effect of the sleep disorder.",

A right-sided cerebral contusion with concussion was diagnosed on initial admission with increasing homicidal and suicidal ideations after 26 hours of insomnia. The patient accomplished rest after seven days of medication-resistant insomnia with the final combination of ziprasidone and lorazepam. After one night of sleep, the patient was alert and oriented with normal mood, affect, and cognition. The insomnia appeared to exacerbate this patient's symptoms, and an atypical insomnia treatment regimen was required to induce somnolence and restore function in this patient.

Anxiety dream incidence was highest when snoring was accompanied by respiratory pauses.

      "title": "Vulnerabilidad cognitiva a la hipocondría: intrusiones, valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales/ cognitive vulnerability to hypochondriasis: intrusions, appraisals and dysfunctional beliefs",
      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis is a disorder characterized by the fear or belief of suffering from a serious illness based on the negative interpretation of bodily signs and symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, confirmation by a physician that the patient does not have a medical condition does not result in safe and lasting reassurance. Generally, people with hypochondriasis may experience a reduction in anxiety after a visit to the doctor, but this reduction lasts only hours or days. When another symptom occurs, anxiety reappears, and the cycle of hypochondriacal worry resumes. In addition, hypochondriasis can manifest itself in different ways. Some patients have numerous intrusive thoughts and sensations during the day that lead them to consult family, friends, the Internet, or different medical specialists to make sure they are not seriously ill or to identify the course of the disease. Other patients, on the other hand, avoid health care providers and any reference to the disease in their daily lives, so that the anxiety they seek to suppress does not increase. Hypochondriasis has also been conceptualized in cognitive models as an extreme form of health anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral proposals of hypochondriasis and health anxiety and recent research on this disorder have suggested different cognitive variables as possible risk factors for the development and maintenance of the problem. They include intrusive thoughts about possible health hazards (illness-ITs), the dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs associated with these thoughts, and dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness. Although these variables have been pointed out in the literature as vulnerability factors for hypochondriasis and health anxiety, there are hardly any studies analyzing their role in the genesis and development of the disorder, and the results obtained are not entirely conclusive either. The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the role played by these variables in hypochondriasis and health anxiety. The preliminary study provided a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate health anxiety in Spanish-speaking adults, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Study 1 explored the presence and characteristics of illness-ITs in the general population, and through this study, a new self-report instrument has been provided, the Illness Intrusive Thoughts Inventory (INPIE), to evaluate illness-ITs. Study 2 examined differences between patients with hypochondriasis and community participants in the recurrence of illness-ITs and the consequences of experiencing them. Studies 2 and 3 also evaluated the role of dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs about illness-ITs. Study 4 analyzed the importance of the family context in the adoption of dysfunctional beliefs about health/illness and thoughts. The results show that (1) the SHAI is an appropriate self-report instrument to measure health anxiety in the Spanish-speaking adult population; (2) the INPIE is an adequate self-report questionnaire to assess the frequency of illness-ITs, as well as the appraisals and control strategies associated with these thoughts; (3) illness-ITs are a universal and dimensional phenomenon; (4) dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs about illness-ITs play a significant role in the escalation from normal intrusive cognitions and their associated consequences to clinical health anxiety-related symptoms; and (5) dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness and thoughts can be acquired within the family. These results have substantial clinical implications because understanding the functioning and characteristics of some of the key elements in the genesis and development of hypochondriasis and health anxiety may improve and update the treatment protocols for these patients. La hipocondria es un trastorno caracterizado por el miedo o la creencia de padecer una enfermedad grave a partir de la interpretacion negativa de los signos y sintomas corporales. La confirmacion por parte de un medico, despues de una evaluacion exhaustiva, de que el paciente no padece una enfermedad medica, no tiene como resultado una tranquilizacion segura y duradera. Por lo general, las personas que presentan hipocondria pueden experimentar una reduccion de la ansiedad despues de visitar al medico, pero esta reduccion dura solo horas o dias. Cuando se presenta otro sintoma, la ansiedad reaparece y el ciclo de preocupacion hipocondriaca se reanuda. Ademas, la hipocondria se puede manifestar de diferentes maneras. Algunos pacientes tienen numerosos pensamientos intrusos y sensaciones durante el dia que los llevan a consultar con la familia, amigos, internet o diferentes especialistas medicos para asegurarse de que no estan gravemente enfermos o para identificar el curso de la enfermedad. Y, otros pacientes, por el contrario, evitan a los proveedores de servicios de salud y cualquier referencia a la enfermedad en su vida diaria, para que no aumente la ansiedad que buscan reprimir. La hipocondria se ha conceptualizado tambien, desde los modelos cognitivos, como la forma mas extrema de ansiedad por la salud. Las propuestas cognitivo-conductuales de la hipocondria y las investigaciones recientes en torno a este trastorno han sugerido diferentes variables cognitivas como posibles factores de riesgo para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del problema. Entre ellos, destacan: los pensamientos intrusos sobre los posibles peligros para la salud (PIEs), las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a estos pensamientos, y los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad. Aunque todas estas variables se han senalado, en la literatura cientifica, como factores de vulnerabilidad hacia la hipocondria, no existen apenas estudios en los que se analice su papel en la genesis y evolucion del trastorno, y los resultados obtenidos tampoco son del todo concluyentes. Por todo ello, la presente Tesis tiene como finalidad clarificar el rol que juegan los pensamientos intrusos, las valoraciones/interpretaciones y las creencias disfuncionales (sobre los pensamientos y sobre la salud/enfermedad) en la hipocondria y la ansiedad por la salud. El estudio preliminar proporciono un instrumento fiable y valido para evaluar la ansiedad por la salud en adultos de habla hispana, el Inventario Breve de Ansiedad por la Salud (SHAI). El Estudio 1 exploro la presencia y caracteristicas de los PIEs en la poblacion general, y a traves de este estudio se ha proporcionado un nuevo instrumento de autoinforme, el Inventario de Pensamientos Intrusos sobre la Enfermedad (INPIE), para evaluar los PIEs. El estudio 2 examino las diferencias entre los pacientes con hipocondria y los participantes de la comunidad en la recurrencia con la que se experimentaban PIEs y las consecuencias derivadas de su experimentacion. Los estudios 2 y 3 tambien evaluaron el papel de las valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs. El estudio 4 analizo la importancia del contexto familiar en la adopcion de supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos. Los resultados muestran que (1) el SHAI es un instrumento de autoinforme apropiado para medir la ansiedad por la salud en la poblacion adulta de habla hispana; (2) el INPIE es un cuestionario de autoinforme adecuado para evaluar la frecuencia de los PIEs, asi como las valoraciones y estrategias de control asociadas a estos pensamientos; (3) los PIEs son un fenomeno universal y dimensional; (4) las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs juegan un papel significativo en la escalada de los pensamientos intrusos normales y sus consecuencias funcionales a los sintomas clinicos relacionados con la ansiedad por la salud, y (5) los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos pueden adquirirse en el seno familiar. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones clinicas sustanciales, ya que la comprension del funcionamiento y las caracteristicas de algunos de los elementos clave para la genesis y el desarrollo de la hipocondria y la ansiedad para la salud puede mejorar y actualizar los protocolos de tratamiento para estos pacientes.",

Generalized anxiety disorders are a chronic anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about everyday life events and situations. In Ayurveda many psychological disorders are mentioned in Samhitas. Terms like Asvastha Chitta, Chittavimbhramsa, Chittodvega etc. seems similar to Generalized anxiety disorder, however Chittodvega seems to be nearest correlation for this disease entity. Acharya Charaka has listed Chittodvega as Manas Dosha Vikara. People with symptoms of Generalized anxiety disorder always tend to expect failure and can't stop worrying, Clinical trials have shown that anxiolytic drugs alone have limited long-term efficacy. Moreover, they often have adverse side effects including dependency, drowsiness, impaired cognition and memory and sexual dysfunction. Being an alarming disease GAD needs an effective management. Nowadays Yoga is considered as a popular approach to improve emotional health. Yoga, a form of holistic mind–body medicine, that includes the use of physical postures (Asanas), breathing practices (Pranayamas), meditations, relaxation techniques and lifestyle changes based on ancient yogic philosophy. Pranayama should be practiced to remove the blockages and to lift you out of the Tamasik and Rajasik states. Asanas empathizes physical strength and helps to maintain balance between mind and body. Yoga helps to restraint unnecessary mental fluctuations and thus helps in stabilizing and calming the mind. Thus it might be an effective and safe intervention for individuals with GAD.",

Assessment should seek to diagnose late-life depression, to identify factors interacting with the mood disorder, self-harm or suicide risk and any features of cognitive or functional impairment. Treatment is usually multimodality involving lifestyle modification, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Electroconvulsive therapy may be indicated in older people with severe or treatment-resistant depression.

      "abstract": "Anxiety is the most universal of all human emotions. It is an energy that cannot be observed directly and must therefore be inferred from behaviour. Most people when faced with a new and unfamiliar situation will experience some degree of anxiety. Normal anxiety is proportional to the threat a person is faced with and can provide arousal that is appropriate to the situation. Mild levels of anxiety can be beneficial, acting as a motivating force, which enhances productivity and performance. Severe anxiety can have an inhibiting effect and move a person away from his optimal level of performance towards behaviours which are non-coping and maladaptive (Graves and Thompson1). The manifestations of anxiety are both physical and psychological (see Figure 1.1) and prepare the individual for fight or flight. While under normal circumstances changes in the functioning of the autonomic system heighten a person's capacity to deal with threats, severe anxiety can severely inhibit a person's level of functioning in so much that the ability to perceive accurately and without distortion is narrowed. In panic, the most extreme manifestation of anxiety, there is a total lack of focus and the person may thrash about purposelessly, his attention being unfocused and unchannelled in such a way that his safety may be threatened.",

Cognitive, behavioral and brief psychodynamic therapies may be helpful in selected cases. Antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have a role in the treatment of severe or persistent depression associated with suicidal behavior, marked psychomotor retardation, starvation or other life-threatening symptoms.

After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "abstract": "Smells, especially unpleasant ones, are seldom viewed as clinical symptoms. They are associated with old medical practice. Modern medicine has relinquished the sense of smell as a tool for diagnosis. However, certain psychiatric disorders are characterized by modifications in body odour, as in Diogenes syndrome, depression, schizophrenia or alcoholism. Various psychopathological and physiological hypotheses are given to explain this phenomenon. In the 60s, the hypothesis of a metabolic disorder in schizophrenics, leading to a specific odour, was put forward but not confirmed. More recently, a possible problem in the sense of smell has been suspected in severely depressed patients who might not properly perceive the sense of pleasure associated with good smells. We will go also into psychological and psychodynamic aspects. For example, the misanthropy associated with bodily slovenliness, and hoarding (a real second skin), is consistent with repulsive bad smells noted during house calls to the sufferers of Diogenes syndrome. Bad smells tend to entail a self-excluding process, well-known in homeless people. Faced with these smells, carers may encounter specific difficulties. Can smelling bad diminish a patient's access to treatment? This communication sets about reviewing this little-studied psychiatric matter, and giving examples, through our clinical experiences, of the problems that carers encounter.",

      "abstract": "> “Hope is a good breakfast but a bad supper” \n> \n> Francis Bacon (1561–1626)\n\nFunctional dyspepsia (FD) has been defined as persistent or recurrent symptoms of unknown cause thought to originate in the proximal gastrointestinal tract. Symptom patterns may vary but usually include epigastric pain or burning. Non-painful dyspeptic symptoms such as early satiation, nausea, postprandial fullness and vomiting suggest an underlying abnormality in gastroduodenal motility. The Rome III consensus committee suggests that FD is subdivided into an epigastric pain syndrome and a postprandial distress syndrome based on symptom patterns.1 These terms have replaced the previous categories of ‘ulcer-like’ and ‘dysmotility-like’ dyspepsia. Dyspeptic symptoms are very common in the general population with prevalence rates of 20–40%, and although FD is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity the symptoms have a major impact on health-related quality of life, utilisation of healthcare resources and work productivity.2\n\nFD is probably a multifactorial disorder. Acid, Helicobacter pylori infection, visceral hypersensitivity, disturbances in gastric motility or accommodation and various psychosocial factors have all been implicated. Empiric antisecretory therapy, H pylori eradication or prokinetics remain the mainstay of treatment for FD, even though meta-analyses have shown limited or no symptomatic effects,3 4 and to date, …",

Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy. Patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly when associated with dementia, had non-RBD episodes of sleep-enactment behaviours occurring upon arousals from either REM or non-REM sleep.",

There is little doubt that sufficient, restorative sleep plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental health. Evaluation of a good sleep always includes its quality, timing, quantity and rhythm. Sleep disturbances, including hypersomnia, insomnia, or irregular sleep patterns, result in various cognitive impairments and mood disorders [1][2] . Prolonged sleep deprivation or chronic sleep abnormalities are risk factors for the major depressive disorder (MDD) 3 and bipolar disorder (BD) 4 , whereas disturbed sleep appears as a key symptom of mental diturbances [5][6] . Mechanisms connecting sleep deprivation and mood disorders remain, however, unclear.The current research topic represents a collection of papers investigating the relationship between sleep abnormalities and mood disorders, as well as studies analyzing potential mechanisms connecting these pathologies. As Taken together, this research topic covers several aspects of sleep disturbances and mood disorders and updates readers on the latest research in this field. These articles will provide researchers in many fields insights into which tools are available and thereby to further explore the relationship between sleep and mood disorders with the ultimate goal of developing effective therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, carry a substantial risk of suicide, particularly during the first-episode psychosis (FEP) phase. This narrative review aims to identify key symptomatic predictors of suicidal behavior in individuals experiencing FEP by thoroughly analyzing existing literature. Studies highlight that the highest suicide risk occurs around the initial presentation for psychiatric services. This critical period encompasses the month before and the 2 months after the first contact with mental health professionals. Severe depressive symptoms and a prolonged duration of untreated psychosis emerge as primary risk factors for suicidal behavior. Depression, when combined with cognitive impairments and a history of childhood trauma, significantly increases the risk of suicidality. These combined factors create a compounded effect, making it more difficult for individuals to cope and increasing their feelings of hopelessness and despair. In addition, poor premorbid functioning—referring to the level of psychological and social functioning before the onset of psychosis—and substance abuse, particularly the use of stimulants, further exacerbate the risk. Substance abuse can also intensify symptoms and impair judgment, leading to an increased likelihood of suicidal behavior. This review underscores the critical importance of timely, comprehensive, and tailored interventions. Early detection and intervention can significantly mitigate the risk of suicide in patients with FEP. Providing targeted treatments that address depressive symptoms, cognitive impairments, and substance abuse issues can improve overall outcomes and enhance the quality of life for these individuals. Comprehensive care approaches and strategies to improve functioning are also essential in reducing suicidality and promoting long-term recovery.",

It is well known that stroke has is related in some way with several sleep disorders. At first, the onset time of stroke varies according to circadian rhythm. Early morning is the most prevalent time and late evening the least. The changes of blood pressure, catecholamine level, plasminogen activity and aggregation of platelet during sleep have been suggested as possible mechanisms. Sleep apnea (SA), a representative disorder in the field of sleep medicine, is found in more than 70% of acute stroke patients compared to 2-5% of the general population. Various sleep related breathing disorders occur after stroke and snoring is a distinct risk factor for stroke. So the relationship between stroke and SA is obvious, but the cause and effect are still not clearly known. Also, stroke may cause many sleep related problems such as insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia and changes in sleep architecture. Patients, family members and even medical personnel often ignore stroke-related sleep problems, being concerned only about the stroke itself. The clinical impacts of sleep problems in stroke patients may be significant not only in terms of quality of life but also as a risk factor or prognostic factor for stroke. More attention should be paid to the sleep problems of stroke patients.",

The greater the background level of anxiety, whether related to acute or chronic situational anxiety or to life stress or marked anticipatory anxiety, the greater the frequency of panic attacks. Some drugs may actually block anxiety, while other drugs may reduce anxiety and work more indirectly by reducing the frequency or threshold for paroxysmal or chronic discharges from the locus coeruleus or similar or interrelated structures.

To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "From the point of view of the ancient medicine, apprehension, which is a feeling of fear and uncertainty regarding the probable outcome or consequences of something, significantly tormented the soul rather than the human body. Altogether with anger, hatred, and yearning, it was classified into the serious diseases, called by the physicians \"perturbations of spirit\" (perturbationes animi). The regimina sanitatis genre provided all the information about them. In this article, we presented a type of the apprehension which today we would term a phobia and describe it as a neurotic disorder. Firstly, we concentrated on the place of the apprehension amongst the other sicknesses of the soul. Secondly, we investigated two kinds of fear, its sources, and its peculiar symptoms. Finally, we depicted a few cases of phobia (musophobia, ailurophobia, hydrophobia, batophobia, etc.) rarely mentioned in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century medical discourses.",

The key to understandings preventing and treating these conditions rests centrally with primal anxiety. Recognition of this mental state before the acute disruptive episode, which may lead to suicide, murder, acute psychosis or group panic, is important, and family physicians are in a favorable position to meet the situation before tragedy supervenes. The distinguishing characteristics of normal anxiety, secondary anxiety and primal anxiety are presented, and symptoms and methods of handling situations seen often by the family physician are outlined.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

Anxiety in turn makes it more difficult for the patient to cope with suffering. In advanced disease, anxiety is often associated with depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale is a sensitive and specific tool for generalised anxiety which can also help in identifying accompanying depression. The differentiating feature is that patients may deny any severe anxiety, although sometimes anxiety is part of the drug effect. A single drug alone is an unusual cause unless higher doses are being used, or the patient is very young or elderly. The risk is much greater when two or more at-risk drugs are used together and this risk can be reduced by avoiding combinations of drugs with this effect. Pain that is not worsened by movement can make some patients restless, mainly as a distractive behaviour.",

When clinicians are investigating insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as parasomnia, they need to consider whether these complaints might be secondary to a psychiatric process. The association that is best supported by scientific evidence is between insomnia and mood disorders. Nonetheless, other psychiatric conditions including anxiety, psychosis, chemical dependency, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are closely linked with alteration in sleep quality and quantity. Treatment plans should take into account the nature of sleep symptomatology as well as the effect of medications on sleep. Ideally, management should include a combination of medications and behavioral treatment.",

The results of traumatic events on emotional state or behavior of child may be short term or long term, anyway they affect development. Events like natural disasters, wars, rapes are traumatic for all people, but chlidren may almost equally be affected by separation, abusing, divorce, death of parents and testifying against abusers or parents. Posttraumatic stress disorder is the most recognizable manifestation of state caused by trauma. Traumatic event is relived on different ways: through frequently recalling events and flashbacks of that experience, avoiding of situations related with trauma, appearing of general insensitivity, that manifests as losing of interests for important activities, impossibilty of emotional binding and sense of isolation from others. The simptomes of posttraumatic disorder are: increased arousal, irritability, anxiety, difficulties with concentration, overemphasized shock. Quality relationship parent-child, support that child had in family before the traumatic experience and current support from social surroundings may be protection factors and prevent occurrence and advancemenet of negative trauma effects.",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

Evidence suggests that sleep disturbances are one of the risk factors that predict an increased risk for suicidal behaviors. Both sleep disorders and general sleep complaints are linked to higher levels of suicidal ideation and depression, as well as increased rates of suicide and suicide attempts. The causal mechanism of this association is not clear. For example, it is not known if insomnia is an independent phenomenon that if interrupted could prevent the emergence of a mental disorder, or if insomnia is a symptom of another developing illness. Hypofrontality, HPA dysfunction, and an impaired serotonergic system are potential mechanisms underlying the association of sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior. Future research is necessary to examine the specific mechanism of this association between sleep and suicide, which may lead to an effective intervention and diminished suicide risk.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and childbirth are moments of great vulnerability in a woman’s life, which can predispose her to the development of psychopathology, ranging from transient depressive symptoms (“baby blues”) to psychotic symptoms. Postpartum delirium is the psychiatric syndrome that some authors refer to as puerperal psychosis par excellence. It was first described in the 18th century and were thought to be associated with painful delivery, then became rare after the introduction of effective analgesia. Objectives The objective of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of this condition, through a literature review. Methods Bibliographic research using Pubmed® and the keywords: postpartum delirium. Results Clinical presentation of postpartum delirium includes: constantly varying degrees of consciousness; perplexity; hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations of one or more organs of sense; delusions or delusive-type thoughts; great motoric unrest and considerable motoric and verbal abandon; and acute aggressive discharges can also occur. It is thought to be due to organic complications, such as infectious disease, abnormal loss of blood, thrombosis, neurological disease, obstetric disease, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes. An article from 1975 mentions how difficult was to treat postpartum delirium despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and had many relapses. They mention a comparative study that found that the symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results. For that reason, at that time, it was the medication of choice. Nowadays the psychopharmacological treatment of puerperal psychosis, in general, still consists of the combination of lithium and an antipsychotic, such as haloperidol, and possibly a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Conclusions Postpartum delirium is rarely mentioned in the literature and just a few cases have been described. It is considered a rare postpartum psychotic condition but would perhaps be less rare if its existence were recognized. On this note, it is important for clinical practice to research on the psychoses of pregnancy and not just the most common. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Overwork, ie, working beyond one's endurance and recuperative capacities, may be a hazard in certain personality types engaged in open-ended occupations. Some persons appear to lack an inner \"governor\" and for various reasons ignore the commonplace signs that inform one of the need for rest or recreation. If they are engaged in occupations that do not have a finite workday, they may at times exceed their bodies' ability to recover. Clusters of symptoms may then develop, some of which may mimic serious physical ailments. Treatment depends on diagnosing the extent of illness and eliciting the underlying causes. Correction involves enforced rest, therapy that may vary from counseling to hospitalization and specialized treatment, but that must include the reeducation of the person to be aware of and make provision for his physical and emotional needs.",

Unawareness of the meaning of these symptoms often mislead both the patient and his physician.To define and describe the types of visual illusions and hallucinations which can be commonly encountered in neuro-ophthalmological practice.Overview article.Hallucinations are a perception not based on sensory input, whereas illusions are a misinterpretation of a correct sensory input. Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms. Then, careful visual function examination should provide a good insight in the location of the lesion.",

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations.

Herausgegriffen werden im folgenden Artikel Schlafstörungen, Anpassungsstörungen, Depressionen sowie das Spektrum der Angsterkrankungen (v.a. Generalisierte Angststörung und Panikattacken), zu denen im amerikanischen Diagnosemanual DSM-IV-R auch die akute Belastungsstörung und die posttraumatische Belastungsstörung zählen. Die genannten Erkrankungen können nicht nur auf der Intensivstation sondern auch nach der Verlegung auf die Normalstation auftreten.

Oftmals erscheinen die Symptome zu Beginn unspezifisch und nur schwer kategorisierbar, daher werden zunächst einige psychopathologische Leitsymptome beschrieben und die entsprechenden Differentialdiagnosen dargestellt. Neben dem genauen Erheben des psychopathologischen Befundes sind auch eine umfassende (psychiatrische) Anamnese und die Beobachtung des Verlaufs wichtig um eine genaue Diagnose zu stellen. Da neben dem individuellen Leid sowohl der weitere Verlauf der somatischen Erkrankung als auch die Rehabilitation beeinträchtigt wird und die Störungen bei fehlender Therapie zur Chronifizierung neigen, ist eine frühzeitige Diagnose durch die Kooperation von Intensivmedizinern und Psychiatern von essentieller Bedeutung.

Recent rapid developments in the field of sleep-disorders medicine have resulted in greater understanding of a variety of sleep-related behaviors, and formal sleep-behavior monitoring techniques have permitted their documentation and classification. Sleep-related violence can be associated with a number of diagnosable and treatable sleep disorders, including (1) night terrors/sleepwalking, (2) nocturnal seizures, (3) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-behavior disorder, (4) sleep drunkenness, and (5) psychogenic dissociative states occurring during the sleep period. Potentially violent automatized behavior, without consciousness, can and does occur during sleep. The violence resulting from these disorders may be misinterpreted as purposeful suicide, assault, or even homicide. Sleep-related violence must be added to the list of automatisms. A classification system of both waking and sleep-related automatic behavior is proposed, with recommendations for assessment of such behavior.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Transient Ischemic Attacks",
      "abstract": "FigureDiagnosing transient ischemic attack is not always simple or straightforward. History may help, as with many entities, but then again, it might not. A patient whose arm was numb, swollen, limp, or “dead” earlier might have actually had a motor problem. Onset of neurologic deficit is generally sudden, and deficits are typically of short duration (less than 30 minutes). Involvement of different body parts affected in succession is more characteristic of migraine or seizure. Preceding seizure may cause a post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis. One paper listed signs and symptoms likely not due to TIA: loss of consciousness, vague weakness or dizziness, mental confusion, and incontinence of urine and feces. (Lancet 1992;339:402.) Similarly, vertigo, diplopia, loss of balance, tinnitus, sensory symptoms confined to part of one limb or the face, drop attacks, and amnesia, all in isolation, are unlikely to be caused by TIA. Symptoms from multiple sclerosis typically last longer, and may be characterized by different neurologic manifestations at different times. (Ann Emerg Med 2004;43:592.) How Much Work-up is Necessary? A few remarks on definitions for a moment: The classic definition of a transient ischemic attack entails a focal neurologic symptom lasting less than 24 hours, resulting from a transient decrease in blood supply making the brain ischemic in the area producing the symptom. With advances in neuroimaging, however, especially diffusion-weighted imaging on magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to identify ischemic brain injury very early. The classic TIA implies restoration of blood flow in a timely enough way to avoid infarction. Transient neurologic symptoms lasting for more than an hour usually imply that some sort of infarction has set in, and these events should not be considered TIAs. Switching from the classic definition to a tissue-based definition would decrease the annual incidence of TIA by approximately 33 percent and increase the annual incidence of stroke by approximately seven percent. (Stroke 2003;34:919.) Diffusion-weighted imaging has the advantage of distinguishing acute infarction from chronic lesions. Some of these are very small; the mean infarct volume detected in TIA patients was less than 1 mL in one report. In fact, this has led some to distinguish transient symptoms with infarction (TSI) from transient symptoms without infarction. (Ann Neurol 2005;57:679.) Clinical TIA duration may not correlate with signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Back to Basics: Why the Hurry? It doesn't make sense to perform expensive tests for an entity that has no emergency treatment and that depends on the results of these tests. (“My back has been killing me for three years. I want an MRI to see what it is once and for all.”) Certainly, it makes sense to put patients on warfarin who have atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, and an EKG is not a time-consuming or expensive test. Symptomatic patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis, on the other hand, may well derive benefit from endarterectomy. Should all patients be admitted? This is probably the question of the hour for the emergency physician. A debate on this topic appeared in Stroke. (2006;37:1137.) As noted last month, the risk of stroke may be 10 percent to 20 percent in the 90 days after TIA. Perhaps half of the risk of early stroke accrues in the first two days after TIA, however. This is hardly enough time to expect a timely outpatient work-up by a neurologist or a patient's primary care provider. Potential benefits for hospitalization include expedited work-up, opportunity for risk factor modification, monitoring patients for deterioration and possible thrombolysis and especially facilitation of early carotid artery revascularization. Carotid surgery has been shown to be most effective when performed within two weeks of the index ischemic event. (Lancet 2004;363:915.) As for medical therapy with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) or a statin, studies to be published soon may shed some light on their efficacy in the hyperacute state after TIA or minor stroke. For patients with atrial fibrillation and TIA, the rate of stroke appears to be approximately five percent in the first two to four weeks, a figure that may not be affected by anticoagulation. (Stroke 2002;33:2722.) There is some evidence that patients with motor or speech deficits of less than 10 minutes' duration, who are over 60, or who have diabetes are at higher risk for early stroke. Clinical risk stratification models for TIA have been developed and are used in some settings. (Stroke 2006;37:1137.) Sending Some Patients Home As with other disease entities, it is useful to confirm the diagnosis of TIA, identify and treat the cause, and especially prevent a disabling or fatal vascular event. Disposition from the emergency department often will be contingent on whether the patient is stable in other ways and prompt follow-up is available. This all presupposes that the emergency physician has made an accurate diagnosis, so that the neurologist isn't trashing the EP for tying up a precious hospital bed for someone with hypoglycemia, Todd's paralysis that resolves by the time the admitting physician comes in, or some benign vestibular disorder. Some experts say brain imaging for the most part can be performed on an outpatient basis, as can carotid scanning and echocardiography, perhaps even in a timely way. (Stroke 2006;37:1139.) Patients do not need to be in the hospital to be taught the value of exercise and cessation of smoking. They can certainly be started on any statin, diuretic, or ACE inhibitor without being hospitalized. Then there are the dangers of being in the hospital at all for anyone: exposure to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, risk of deep venous thrombosis, and deconditioning from being confined to a hospital bed. At any rate, many patients with TIA and normal imaging on diffusion-weighted imaging do well. One study of 83 consecutive patients listed th incidence of recurrent cerebral ischemic event after approximately 13 months at 30 percent if infarction was present, but only 14 percent if no infarction was present on diffusion-weighted imaging. (Stroke 2004;35:2313.) More convincingly, in a case series of 57 patients presenting with TIA, the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who had TIA with infarction during their hospital stay (3 to 5 days) was 14.8 percent, while no recurrent or new stroke occurred in patients with TIA and normal imaging. (Cerebrovasc Dis 2002;14:177.) The Bottom Lines There will be ongoing debate about how TIA should be defined and what technology is needed to determine whether a TIA actually occurred. From our perspective, there are some therapies which may prevent stroke and enough science to justify testing. It certainly adds more value to prevent neurologic deficit than to hospitalize someone after a CVA for rehabilitation purposes. There is a dearth of evidence on exactly what to do with the TIA patient in the emergency department. Patients with clear neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemiparesis may be at higher risk than those with sensory events or vertigo. TIA work-up clearly lends itself to a brief hospital observation stay. Because the persistent concern is for tight carotid stenosis requiring revascularization, the case could be made for sending TIA patients home as long as their carotid arteries have been evaluated. Clearly, the last word has not been issued about whether all TIAs should be admitted. The fact that there has been a debate published this year (pro and con) in the stroke literature attests to this. In fact, the con position in the debate over hospitalization for TIAs was held by a geriatrician who works in a national health service country (Australia). If he thinks he can get a timely work-up there, surely we might be able to do so in the U.S. EMN on the Web Looking for Dr. James Roberts' article on kidney stones?

Because these anxiety attacks can appear spontaneously and unpredictably, they often create a companion state in which the patient continually worries about when the next attack will occur. Left untreated, panic disorder can be seriously debilitating and can progress to the development of phobias and impose severe limitations on quality of life. Otolaryngologists are likely to see patients with panic disorder, particularly those who have complaints of dizziness, tinnitus, or extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux.

      "title": "Light Treatment for Sleep Disorders: Consensus Report",
      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

      "abstract": "Summary Insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common in older people, with up to 40% reporting some difficulty sleeping. Insomnia is a syndrome with multiple causes including medications, other illnesses and environmental factors. An accurate diagnosis is needed for effective management. Sleep disturbances are associated with functional and cognitive impairment and excess mortality. Management should initially be non-pharmacological including sleep hygiene education and behavioural therapy. Medications, including benzodiazepines (BZDs), are second-line with little evidence to support long-term usage. BZD usage in older people is associated with a range of disorders including falls, accidents and cognitive impairment. The management of insomnia in specific situations such as residential care, those with dementia and depressed older people can be challenging. Additional research is needed, particularly on the risks/benefit of long-term pharmacotherapy and to determine whether therapy reduces the consequences of sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Longer life expectancy in the elderly is a worldwide phenomenon observed during the last two decades owing to the improvements in socioeconomic status, better health policies and revolutionary efforts in imparting health awareness amongst the general public through print, visual and social media. This lead to the concept of â€œactive agingâ€ by maximizing the health and functional ability of older people to achieve disease and disability free quality living. Extensive studies have been performed to assess factors that may affect active aging, such as metabolic, vascular and neuropsychological factors, and sleep disorders, such as insomnia, Obstructive Sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and other sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD). However, OSAHS and SRBD remains under diagnosed despite the diagnostic and therapeutic advances in this field leading to the evolution of a new specialty of medicine, the sleep medicine. In middle-aged adults, snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, poorly controlled hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, depression, accelerated cognitive decline and traffic accidents should prompt screening and an evaluation for the possibility of an undiagnosed OSAHS. Although OSAHS in the elderly seems to have a lower impact on mortality than it does in middle-aged adults, the risk of stroke and new-onset hypertension appears to increase in elderly patients. In addition, the presence of central sleep apnea must prompt a thorough cardiac assessment, even in the elderly. Both elderly and middle-aged symptomatic OSA patients derive equivalent benefits from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.",

When deployed within Gothic fiction, these states are usually enhanced further through a customary (though scientifically dubious) association with occult phenomena such as prescience and clairvoyance, and with suggestions of personal and sexual violations of the entranced self, the origins of which can be traced to the earliest days of systematic hypnotism in Europe.",

      "abstract": "Prevention campaigns to avoid risk factors for the occurrence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) during sleep have led to a significant decrease in the number of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly during sleep. Despite a growing amount of evidence, the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for SIDS is still largely incomplete. We will review the most recent epidemiological, electrophysiological, genetic and pathological research on this topic. From these data, a comprehensive model for SIDS has been proposed: the death would result from the combination of three factors (a prenatal vulnerability, a critical developmental period and an exogenous postnatal stress) and three potential mechanisms (deficiencies in breathing, autonomic and sleep-wake controls). As arousal represents the last chance of survival when an infant is exposed to a life-threatening challenge during sleep, failure to arouse could be involved in the final pathway of SIDS. An infant could be vulnerable to SIDS because of a deficiency in cardio-respiratory or in sleep/wake behaviour controls during sleep. Genetic, metabolic, nutritional or toxic prenatal brainstem injury could be responsible for these deficits. The infant s vulnerability lies latent until he/she enters the critical developmental period from 2 to 6 months when significant changes in sleep-wake, breathing and autonomic controls occur. The accident has a greater probability of occurring when the infant is exposed to an infection, or an unfavourable environmental factor which enhances the immature cardio respiratory and sleep/wake behaviours of the infant.

[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This distorted sense of leads persons with schizophrenia to fail to recognize what is or is not part of their own mind, which can produce clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including bizarre delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, social deficits, and information processing. (1) Just as intact physical proprioception enables a healthy person to be continuously aware of where his body and its parts are located in space, allowing sensory-motor integration, mental proprioception enables one to be fully aware of his identity and self-boundaries, and that his thoughts and actions are generated from within his own sphere of consciousness, not from an external source. In schizophrenia, the coherent sense of is shattered and fragmented, a frightening experience patients describe after emerging from psychosis. (2) A person affected by schizophrenia feels lost, as if his no longer belong[s] to him. He feels alienated from his real self and refers to himself in the third person. He feels disconnected, disintegrated, and diminished, with a sense of emptiness, a painful void of existence, of being disembodied with no clear demarcation between and others. (2) Not surprisingly, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptual aberrations (hallucinations) emerge from a fragmented sense of self. Patients fail to recognize that their actions, thoughts, or feelings are initiated from within the self, leading to delusions of passivity and being controlled by an outside force. One's impulses are misperceived as being imposed by an alien. One's thoughts, fantasies, and memories become external hallucinations instead of internal recollections. It is not surprising that depersonalization and derealization are common in schizophrenia and in the prodrome stage. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychoses, are known to trigger dissociative phenomena and a loss of a coherent sense of self. What causes the disintegration of the mind (self) in schizophrenia? The leading neurobiologic explanation is well-documented white matter pathology. (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the myelinated axons and fibers that connect various brain regions are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. The evidence for the breakdown of white matter--and, consequently, brain connectedness and integration--includes several lines of evidence, such as: a) in vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that show abnormal water mobility in the myelin; b) genetic aberrations in myelin genes; c) postmortem evidence of reduced oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that manufacture myelin; and d) biochemical markers such as the calcium-binding protein S100B, which is released by compromised glial cells. (3) Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the disruption of the sense of and its proprioception may be due to the extensive disconnectivity of brain regions caused by myelin pathology. (4) However, grey matter abnormality also may play a role in loss of mental proprioceptive functions, which causes a failure to properly recognize one's self. The inferior parietal cortex, which controls body image, concept of self, sensory integration, and executive function, has been reported to be structurally impaired in patients with schizophrenia. …",

      "abstract": "Neurologists frequently see patients with symptoms or inconsistent signs that are not explicable in terms of any recognized neurological disease process. Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

This is followed gradually by anger, guilt, sadness, and many times by some continuing denial. These feelings may occur together, separately, or in combination and for a variable period of time. Resolution of these emotions and acceptance of the death generally takes 1 to 2 years.",

      "title": "Treating Insomnia: Pharmacological and Nonpharmacological Approaches",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a commonly encountered condition in clinical practice. The prevalence of self-reported poor sleep increases with age and is more common in women. There are clear associations between poor sleep and psychiatric disturbance; however, causality in this regard may be complex, and there are at least some insomniacs who show high somatic tension without marked psychopathology. The development of chronic insomnia can be conceptualized as involving predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. Pharmacological treatments for insomnia most typically involve judicious and intermittent usage of a benzodiazepine hypnotic. A variety of such medications are available, with varying absorption and elimination characteristics. Benzodiazepines are preferred over antidepressants in the treatment of insomnia inindividuals without major psychiatric disorder because of fewer side effects and a larger margin of safety. Nonpharmacological treatments typically rely on elements of sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and chronotherapy. The establishment of good patient-clinician rapport and the working through of unfounded beliefs and unrealistic expectations of the sleep experience are also important components of the behavioral treatment of insomnia. Use of such techniques, particularly when combined in a treatment package, has shown appreciable benefits in improving sleep.",

The actual prevalence varies according to the setting, type and severity of disease, the individual's perception of their condition and premorbid risk factors (e.g. childhood adversity). Depression has a bi-directional causal relationship with physical disease, so each can be a risk factor for the other. Depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur more often than as separate conditions and are often undetected or diagnosed by primary and secondary healthcare staff. People who experience depression and physical illness understand depression as part of their whole life experience and not just as being simply related to their physical health. Depression, and to a lesser extent anxiety, in the context of physical disease are associated with a range of poor outcomes, including poorer physical health outcomes and quality of life; increased hospitalisations, investigations and healthcare costs; and higher mortality.",

      "abstract": "The correlations between sleep and prolonged epileptic activity are discussed on the basis of the status classification of Gastaut (1983). Little information is available on the interrelation of sleep and the status of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal status). Most important is the therapeutical management of these cases. Tonic seizures have been reported to occur in large numbers during NREM sleep in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A status-like increase is possible. Tonic seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep. Myoclonic status epilepticus arising (a) in the course of primary generalized epilepsy and (b) in the course of encephalopathies, are usually markedly attenuated during sleep. In absence status (petit mal status) synchronized sleep generally fragments the continuous discharge which is replaced by isolated bursts of polyspikes, or polyspike and wave complexes. The absence status can recur upon awaking during the night or in the morning. The abnormal EEG activity of a petit mal status can, however, occasionally persist during the whole night. Improvement as well as activation during sleep have been observed in elementary (= simple) partial status epilepticus; improvement seems to be more frequent. Epilepsia partialis continua may persist or decrease during sleep. An increase as well as decrease of motor phenomena has been observed during the REM stages. 'Epileptic aphasia' of childhood is associated with subclinical bioelectric status epilepticus during sleep. The electrical status epilepticus must be delineated as a separate group. The term encephalopathy related to electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES) has been proposed on the basis of associated psychic syndromes. This form of status epilepticus disappears during the waking state and during REM sleep. Cases with hypsarrhythmia without clinical signs may also be classified under the group of electrical or bioelectrical status. In some cases, a continuous hypsarrhythmia is observed only during sleep. In this context, one must also mention those patients who demonstrate continuous activation of spikes, or spike and wave potentials (without clinical seizures) during eye closure.",

      "title": "The role of problem solving and level of disability in predicting caregiver distress following stroke",
      "abstract": "In society today, strokes occur regardless of age. It is becoming commonplace for adults of all ages to experience cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) secondary to stressful, unhealthy lifestyles or preexisting medical condition(s). Impairments resulting from stroke can vary in severity and are often inclusive of but not limited to language difficulty, decreased or loss of motor function (contralateral to the CVA), and/or changes in baseline cognitive functioning. More specific cognitive deficits affect memory, attention and other complex cognitive processes. These cognitive impairments can often result in a disruption of the patient's ability to continue with their occupation and daily activities, including personal hygiene. Hence, the patient may lose their occupational status in addition to requiring assistance with activities of daily living. With the sparsity of financial resources available to subsidize long-term care, family members or significant others become caregivers for these patients on top of their daily pre-existing responsibilities. As a result, caregivers often report a great deal of psychological distress, in particular, depression and anxiety. Past literature supports the idea that the psychological wellness of the caregiver is vital to the care and well being of the stroke patient. The current study examined the relationship of caregiver problem solving skills, care recipient disability, and caregiver distress. Primary analyses revealed that problem solving ability is predictive of negative affect. Furthermore, problem solving ability was also found to be a moderator between disability and caregiver depression. The results of secondary analyses isolated positive and negative problem orientation as well as avoidant problem solving style as highly predictive of caregiver distress. Highly significant interaction effects were also identified between these same problem solving components and the level of the care recipient's disability in predicting distress. The results of the current research suggest that caregivers who may be at risk for high levels of distress can be identified by their problem solving styles. Early identification of these \"at risk\" individuals may allow for the provision of interventions that may ease their caregiving distress and thus result in better psychological health.",

      "abstract": "Flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam are compared in terms of initial and short term efficacy, effectiveness during intermediate and long term use, withdrawal effects, and general side effects. The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hangover). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

      "title": "Family Stress and Counseling",
      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

      "title": "Daytime functioning and quality of life in chronic insomnia: a multi-method, multi-level approach",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is characterised by difficulties with initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Similar to most psychiatric and mental health conditions, insomnia is defined according to subjective complaint, and achieves disorder ‘status’ when associated daytime functioning impairment is present. Yet, ironically, it is these two cornerstones of insomnia disorder, combined, that have achieved relatively minimal attention in the literature. That is, perhaps surprisingly, the subjective experience, and impact of insomnia, at least from the patient (‘expert’) perspective, has been under-researched. Night-time symptoms and sleep parameters have typically been the target of both treatment and non-treatment (clinical, epidemiological, mechanistic) research.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, a multi-method, multi-level approach is adopted to better understand the daytime experience of those with chronically disturbed sleep. First, a brief overview (chapter one) of insomnia is provided to familiarise the reader with the ‘problem of insomnia’. A narrative review (chapter two) then sets the scene in relation to the assessment and measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and daytime functioning. This work reveals several inadequacies and limitations of existing work, and outlines a prospective research agenda. \r\n\r\nChapter three describes the first ever phenomenological study carried out in primary insomnia patients. Here, two qualitative methodologies, focus groups and audio-diaries, are combined to help better understand the proximal and distal impairments attributed to chronic sleep disturbance. Chapter four builds on this work by describing the creation of two new clinical scales, developed to quantify, in both valid and novel ways, the impact of poor sleep on aspects of daytime functioning and insomnia-related quality of life.\r\n\r\nChapter five combines the aforementioned qualitative and questionnaire approaches to explore the experience of an effective behavioural intervention for insomnia, sleep restriction therapy (SRT). The application of these refined methods provided insight into the effects of SRT on both sleep and daytime functioning, but also permitted exploration of treatment-related issues - such as adherence, side-effects, and mechanisms of action - that have otherwise been difficult to probe using traditional quantitative methodologies.\r\n\r\nChapter six tackles the issue of objective daytime impairment, typically assessed using computerised reaction time tasks. Through ‘mining’ an existing brain and behavioural database, and applying an algorithm to select poor and normal sleepers, it was possible to investigate cognitive functioning at two broad stages of processing – event-related potentials generated from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), and performance output using neuropsychological testing. The results provide some interesting hypotheses concerning possible cognition-arousal and -effort interactions. Importantly, as a by-product of this work, a methodological template for the future standardized assessment of brain and behavioural function in insomnia is considered.\r\n\r\nFinally, chapter seven synthesises the results of each preceding experimental chapter, with particular emphasis on how this work will advance research, measurement and understanding of insomnia-related functioning. Immediate clinical implications and relevance to other areas of insomnia research are also briefly considered.",

      "abstract": "The physician, like any other human being, is subject to emotional problems, greed, jealousy, and instability of an individual under stress as well as mental disease which may all bring out improper behavior or criminal activity. Over the last two centuries, there have been instances where physicians have committed deliberate acts of murder on wives, relatives, patients, and others. Their motivation has ranged from ridding themselves of a nagging wife or for insurance and inheritance gains to insane acts. The methods used have usually been associated with poisons and drugs, of which the physician may have great familiarity. The frequency of physician-involved murders seems to have increased in the past two decades with several sensational cases being the topics of media coverage and further review in books and visual media, including television and the movies. The investigation of these cases may be very difficult, especially when a drug may be given to a victim which could cause severe problems after small amounts are given. The detection of death as being a murder may be the first problem faced, the demonstration of the fatal agent in the body in the next problem, and probably the most difficult is finding a suspect with the medication in his or her possession or paraphenalia for injecting such as a syringe and needle. The stealth and cunning of the murderer may further complicate the picture for the investigator as well as the reputation of the physician in the community, which is often above reproach so that the public has to be convinced of the actual involvement of the suspect.",

The most common sleep disorder contributing to inadequate sleep and daytime impairments in pediatric populations is insomnia. There are both biological and behavioral factors that can contribute to insomnia; therefore, understanding sleep processes, how sleep changes throughout development, and which common behaviors influence sleep is important. Measurement of sleep through both objective and subjective measures plays an important role in the identification, diagnosis, and intervention of insomnia. First-line treatment for insomnia includes psychoeducation, healthy sleep practices, and behavioral and cognitive strategies. Children with special needs are at especially high risk for sleep problems, and treatment of insomnia in these populations should aim to minimize sleep disturbances without increasing other comorbid symptoms. Moving forward, healthcare professionals require access to more comprehensive education on pediatric sleep, and greater public awareness of the importance of sleep and health is needed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias can often be confused for seizures and vice versa, but differentiating between them is often necessary. Seizures, in general, occur more frequently during sleep or sleep-wake transitions, so having nocturnal events is not uncommon. Limb movements or other behaviors during sleep are not always seizure-related. Some parasomnias such as sleep enuresis, somnambulism, and somniloquy are more common in children. Sleep terrors, nightmares and rapid eye movement behavioral disorder can be confused with seizures. A careful history can often help differentiate between seizures and parasomnias, but in many cases polysomnography and/or video-EEG is required for definitive characterization. As the approach to treatment can be different, it is important to correctly diagnose the condition.",

Exploring the neurophysiology linking sleep with daytime performance in patients with developmental disabilities is now possible using minimally sufficient sleep and sleep-sensitive behavioral assays. Although frequent sampling represents the primary difficulty, it is required to untangle coincident effects of sleep quality amidst circadian variation. Recent evidence finds high quality sleep promotes brain plasticity, improves health measures, and enriches quality of life. Sleep treatments for apnea, insomnia, restless limbs, and conditioned sleep-aversion are available, although not readily provided, for people with developmental disabilities.

Polysomnographic studies have shown that, in comparison to normal subjects, the sleep of patients with panic disorder is characterized by longer sleep latency, increased time awake and reduced sleep efficiency. Sleep architecture is normal and there are no significant changes in REM sleep measures. Nocturnal panic attacks are non-REM-related events and occur without an obvious trigger in 18-45% of panic disorder patients. Regarding generalized anxiety disorder, the patients complain of 'trouble sleeping' in 60-70%, while polysomnography has shown increased sleep latency and decreased sleep continuity measures. The findings in REM sleep and sleep architecture generally do not show any aberration to exist. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), results from the sleep laboratory do not seem to support the subjective complaints of poor sleep. The early reports of shortened REM latency in OCD could not be replicated by recent studies. A dysregulation of the REM sleep control system has been reported for patients with PTSD. Finally, no significant differences were found in all sleep parameters between social phobia patients and controls.",

      "title": "THE MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANCE IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "In the general population, presence of a mood disorder increases the odds of a substance use disorder.71 Substance use and abuse is common in psychiatric patients, and depressive syndromes are common in patients seeking treatment for substance abuse.1, 89 Aside from their common co-occurrence, there are at least three sets of reasons to focus on clinically when treating the combination of substance use and depression: Substances, through their acute and chronic effects, may worsen depression and contribute to treatment resistance. DSM-IV lists either substance-induced mood, anxiety, or sleep disorders as resulting from practically every class of addictive substances.2 Thus, substance use could either worsen or account entirely for a treatment-resistant depressive syndrome. Depression may worsen the severity of substance use, increasing its deleterious effects over time. It has been shown consistently that patients with both depression and substance use syndromes have a poorer prognosis along various domains of outcome. * In particular the combination of depression and substance abuse increases the risk of suicide.42, 51 Substance use disorder in a depressive patient may point the way to other, previously unappreciated psychopathologic conditions that may contribute to treatment resistance. In the general population, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders are more strongly associated with substance abuse than is depression.71 These have specific treatment indications, mood stabilizers and various nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety regimens, 55 which might improve outcome in previously treatment-resistant cases. For example, buspirone has been shown to improve outcome in alcoholics with generalized anxiety symptoms.40 Explosive irritable mood in substance abusers may benefit from mood stabilizers, even in the absence of clear-cut bipolar disorder.21, 22 Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a well-established risk factor for substance abuse and also is associated with depression.9, 10, 11, 24, 35 Such patients might benefit from antidepressant agents with demonstrated efficacy against ADD, such as desipramine or bupropion.4, 8, 12 Alcohol and other substances may cause dementia syndromes with associated mood symptoms, 34 which would suggest further neurologic and medical evaluation. The development of recommendations for treatment-resistant depression in patients with substance abuse or dependence is complicated by three issues: (1) Two domains of outcome are involved—substance use symptoms and mood symptoms; (2) Diagnostic uncertainty surrounds depressive symptoms in the setting of ongoing substance use; and (3) There is a relative lack of empiric studies on treatment of depression in substance abusers. An empiric base is beginning to accumulate on the initial treatment of depression in substance abusers, and this is reviewed in this article. There are no systematic studies to date on treatment-resistant depression in these patients. Illustrative cases are presented from the authors' clinical experience that suggest general principles and directions for future research.",

Attempted suicide is common in patients with psychiatric disorders, and may also occur in individuals with physical health problems. Suicide, even when completed, is not without meaning. Suicidal ideation is often triggered by feelings of hopelessness or social isolation. Individuals who commit suicide have usually indicated their wish to die either directly or indirectly prior to the suicide attempt. Persons who undertake suicide attempts usually go through the stages of contemplating suicidal ideas as a possibility to terminate intense suffering, which is followed by a period of ambivalence and narrowing of perceived alternative options before a final decision is made. Suicide attempts with terminal intent can be classified as desperate or impulsive. In a minority of cases, suicide is altruistically motivated, and such behaviour may not necessarily be associated with psychopathology.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related breathing disorders, particularly obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), are highly prevalent and represent an increasing part of clinical respiratory practice. OSAS represents something of a paradox in clinical medicine. On the one hand, the clinical disorder has been widely recognised only in recent decades, although the sleeping characteristics of OSAS have been recognised in the medical and classical literature for centuries. On the other hand, OSAS is now recognised to be highly prevalent with recent prevalence figures approaching those of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1,2), and there is increasing evidence that OSAS is associated with many adverse sequelae, both behavioural and physical. Behavioural features include daytime sleepiness, impaired memory and concentration, whereas physical consequences include cardiovascular and metabolic disorders (3). Although sleep apnoea was first described as a specific clinical entity in the late 1950s, there are several descriptions in earlier clinical journals that clearly refer to the disorder. The sleeping characteristics of obstructive apnoea were clearly described by Broadbent (4) in the late nineteenth century: “there will be perfect silence through two, three, or four respiratory periods, in which there are ineffectual chest movements; finally air enters with a loud snort, after which there are several compensatory deep inspirations”.",

Few posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes are more disruptive to interpersonal familial, societal, educational, and occupational functioning and activities than agitation, aggression, and violent behaviors. Agitation and irritability that occur in a patient during the acute stages of recovery from TBI not only endanger the safety of the patient and his or her caregivers but also predict increased lengths of hospital stay and impaired cognition (Bogner et al. 2001). As recovery continues, low frustration tolerance and explosive behavior may develop in response to minimal provocation or sometimes may occur without any warning at all. These behaviors may be limited to irritability or may include violent outbursts resulting in damage to property or assaults on others. In severe cases, it may be unsafe for individuals with aggressive disorders to remain in the community or with their families, and referral to long-term psychiatric or neurobehavioral facilities is sometimes required. All clinicians, and especially mental health professionals, need to be knowledgeable about and able to evaluate and treat neurologically induced agitation, irritability, aggression, and violence among their patients with TBI.",

      "title": "Introduction: Emotion and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Given the complexity and exquisite regulation of emotion described in previous chapters, it is not surprising that emotional dysfunction lies at the core of a variety of psychopathological conditions. The syndromes of emotional dysregulation lie on a continuum of temporal characteristics, ranging from seconds/minutes (panic attacks) to hours/days (borderline personality disorder) to weeks/ months (unipolar and bipolar illness) to years/lifetime (schizophrenia and autism). The panic/anxiety disorders are characterized by paroxysmal episodes of panic, sometimes superimposed on more chronic components of dysphoria, agoraphobia, and depression. The marked mood lability of borderline personality disorder and its interdigitation with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndromes are typified by extremely rapid and major mood shifts. Included in this phasic dysregulation are prominent components of anxiety, depression, proneness to substance abuse, and chaotic experience of the self and relationships to others. The unipolar and bipolar affective disorders range from chronic dysthymia to irregular bursts of recurrent brief depression to minor and major depression to these conditions in the context of hypomania (bipolar II) and fullblown mania (bipolar I). This range of depressive and manic mood disorders is common in the general population and most typical of psychopathologies involving dysfunction of emotional regulation. The schizophrenias are more commonly associated with a persistent disconnection of affect from its appropriate context, and thus they present with prominent autistic components. In childhood autism itself there is an early and chronic breakdown of emotional communication that often involves an absence of normal language and affective responsiveness to others. Given this range of type and temporal dissimilarities among the major psychopathological syndromes of emotion, we chose to highlight in this part several of the more prominent syndromes and components that bridge diagnostic categories Although each of the chapters has a separate focus, it is worth emphasizing the constant interaction and interplay of cognition, emotion, and neurobiology that is important not only for understanding the psychological and neurobiological substrates of affective dysregulation but also for approaches to therapeutics that can also involve each of three domains (affective, cognitive, and somatic) as primary targets.",

The SCN aligns whole-body cellular, behavioral and phenomenological processes with the Earth’s 24-hour day/night rhythm. When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

This condition, attributed to the persistence of muscle atonia from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep into wakefulness, is associated with factors like sleep deprivation and irregular sleep patterns. While isolated episodes of SP are generally benign, recurrent episodes may warrant clinical attention, particularly when accompanied by distressing symptoms. Despite its prevalence across cultures and its documented association with various medical conditions, SP remains poorly understood by many. This review explores the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and associated risk factors of SP, drawing from a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature.

P. p and r. p. p are two different manifestations of the dissociation between EEG and many other physiological activities, especially vegetative functions.3. The fact that p. p is apt to appear at the end of each single sleep cycleand r. p. p comes at the beginning or in the middle of each single sleep cycle could account for the phasic shift of changes in EEG and other physiological functions.4. The prominent occurrence of p. p in the latter half and r. p. p in the first half of the natural night sleep could be attributed to the difference in distribution pattern of activity level of each physiological function. For instance, more occurence of EEG III can be seen in the earlier period of the night sleep, while the depressed or minor activity of GSR, blood pressure is distributed more in the latter half of the night sleep.",

However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next.

Acute neurologic conditions produce sudden plot twists and are thus frequently used in screenplays. Dark Victory is a farce when it comes to neurologic manifestations of a brain tumor. Motor neuron disease is not a topic readily chosen by screenwriters, and when it is used, it seems to fall into the general categories of \"severe disability\" and \"dying from an untreatable disorder.\" In The Hawaiians, there is a very brief scene showing crippled lepers separated on an island who are pushed away by the lead actor in the film. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has clear criteria for somnambulism that include persistence of sleep or impaired judgment during ambulation and a disturbance that is not better explained by other disorders, drug use, or substance-use disorder.",

      "title": "Phobic disorders",
      "abstract": "Phobias include agoraphobia, specific or simple phobia and SP (DSM-IV, 1994). Phobias are characterised by persistent and irrational fears of situations, objects, or activities that result in a compelling desire to avoid phobic stimuli. In DSM-III-R, agoraphobia came to be characterised as a secondary complication of panic and distinct from other phobias. In DSM-IV, agoraphobia, by definition, involves fear of panic attacks or limited symptom panic attacks, so the agoraphobic phenotype can no longer be separated from panic. This view is supported by a substantial body of evidence, but it remains controversial (Widiger et al., 1996). The defining feature of PD may instead be the recurrence of unexpected panic attacks and the development of anticipatory anxiety about additional attacks (Barlow et al., 1994). DSM-IV distinguishes the following subtypes of specific phobias: animal type (e.g., spiders, insects), natural environment type (e.g., storms, heights), blood-injection-injury type (e.g., seeing blood, receiving injections) and situational type (e.g., flying, enclosed spaces). The DSM-IV further notes that specific phobias frequently co-occur. In many cases, more than one subtype of specific phobia is present so that specific phobias form a heterogeneous class of anxiety disorders that frequently occur comorbidly. In a study designed to examine the structure of specific phobias, the results showed that specific phobia symptoms clustered into three factors: animal phobia, blood-injection-injury phobia and a third factor combining natural environment and situational phobias (Frederikson et al., 1996). Although the DSM-IV suggests that natural environment and situational phobias are distinct types of specific phobias, the finding that these types loaded on one factor is not surprising. We may note the strong resemblance as \"fear of heights\" considered as a natural environment phobia comes close to \"fear of elevators\" and \"fear of flying\" that belong to the situational phobias. Interestingly, these empirically derived types of specific phobias are largely in keeping with the typology as proposed by DSM-IV. A recent study designed to examine whether specific phobia subtypes can also be found in children confirmed that childhood-specific phobia symptoms indeed cluster into the three subtypes as described by Frederikson et al. and that these subtypes are either inter-correlated or the product of a single higher order factor (Muris et al., 1999).",

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

The level of anxiety experienced by the person with social anxiety disorder is excessive, and results in substantial impairment in the sufferer's social, family, and professional life. Three distinct subtypes of the disorder have been identified: generalized social anxiety disorder, in which the individual fears a multitude of social situations; nongeneralized social anxiety disorder, in which only 2 or 3 situations are feared; and public-speaking phobia. Results from a number of studies suggest that these subtypes of social anxiety disorder may represent distinct clinical syndromes, with the generalized subtype producing the most severe disability. Despite the prevalence of social anxiety disorder and the disability it causes, this condition remains underdiagnosed, and thus undertreated, by clinicians. This review discusses the barriers that prevent people who have this disorder from seeking help, and the steps that clinicians can take to aid their recognition and treatment of the disorder. It is only by effective diagnosis and treatment that the burden of social anxiety disorder will be lifted, allowing patients to resume a normal life.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

Each of these states is composed of a number of physiologic variables generated in a variety of neural structures. The predictable oscillations of these states are driven by presumed neural pacemakers which are entrained to the 24 h geophysical environment by the light/dark cycle. Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health. Some fascinating clinical and experimental phenomena may represent bifurcations in the sleep/wake control system.",

In delayed sleep phase syndrome, patients may experience “sleep drunkenness” upon awakening, with confusion, disorientation, and impaired motor coordination. Generally individuals suffer with disturbances of circadian rhythm for years before getting treatment. Treatment approaches often involve a carefully planned, gradual shifting of sleep time and the use of melatonin as well as the bright light therapy that are timed carefully, depending on the clinical situation. The control of the sleep/wake cycle is complex. It is affected by the genetic factors, maintained by neurologic and hormonal systems, and responsive to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination.

According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is a distressing and debilitating condition with a familial tendency; it may be associated with situational (agoraphobic) avoidance. The diagnosis of panic disorder requires recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and at least one of the following characteristics: persistent concern about having an additional attack (anticipatory anxiety); worry about the implications of an attack or its consequences (e.g., a catastrophic medical or mental consequence) and making a significant change in behavior as a consequence of the attacks. A variety of pharmacologic interventions is available, as are non-pharmacologic cognitive or cognitive-behavioral therapies that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of panic disorder. Early detection and thoughtful selection of appropriate first-line interventions can help these patients, who often have been impaired for years, regain their confidence and ability to function in society.",

The true extent of the problem is not known, but it seems certain that these syndromes are much more common than was generally assumed five years ago. Every clinician should be aware of the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea because of the rapid and prompt response to therapeutic measures. Sleep apnea syndromes, whether obstructive or central, can result in systemic or pulmonary hypertension, arterial blood gas abnormalities, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, chronic respiratory failure, sleep disturbances, narcolepsy, excessive daytime somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and the suspicion of mental retardation. The immediate and dramatic improvement produced by tracheostomy in the obstructive type of sleep apnea, or nocturnal ventilatory support in the central type, can not only enhance the quality of life for these patients, but return them to functional and productive lives.",

In contrast to what have been previously described as “subaffective disorders,” the condition presented here develops later in life, after a premorbid history of high social function and after long-lasting stresses or multiple losses before onset. Long-term course is that of an affective disorder, sometimes ending in suicide if not treated. It is also suggested that these patients undergo a process of regression under the influence of a chronic exposure to stress. The condition was initially observed among Eastern European immigrant patients but may also occur among individuals in high-stress jobs. The name “pseudoborderline syndrome” is proposed and it is speculated that masked affective disorders may appear in the form of “pseudo-syndromes”—pseudodementia, pseudomania, pseudohypochondriasis, pseudoborderline.",

      "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental disorders adversely affect sleep; children often have difficulty in falling asleep, wake up more often during the night, and sleep less than their typically developing peers. ‘Sleep problems’ were found in 53% of over 300 children with autism, compared with 44% of 63 children with delayed development, and 32% of 163 children with normal (typical) development.1 Sleep problems arise from complex interactions between biological, psychological, social, family and cultural factors. Circadian sleep rhythm disorders (CSRD) may be acute but are more often chronic, and frequently result in associated health problems. CSRDs usually exacerbate any pre-existing learning and behavioural difficulties, and may affect the entire family's whole health and well-being and impair their ability to continue in employment or further education.\n\nThere is considerable pressure for both parents and paediatricians to try and improve a child's disturbed sleep. Management options include behavioural, or pharmacological, or both. Behavioural interventions are probably undervalued, but may be difficult to implement, and may take weeks or months to show any benefit. Conventional medications including hypnotics and sedatives are frequently associated with unacceptable day-time sedation that may adversely affect the child's quality of life. The past 20 years have witnessed the introduction of melatonin which continues to be increasingly prescribed to many children both with and without neurodevelopmental disorders and using a wide range of doses. To many, it is the ubiquitous safe solution to any ‘sleep problem’. The popularity of melatonin reflects the …",

      "abstract": "Similar to the setting of other chronic, debilitating diseases, considerable psychoeducational support of the patient's family and other caregivers represents an often-overlooked component of appropriately thorough care. Nearly three of four persons caring for an individual with PD report psychological stress and anxiety, which are exacerbated by concerns about progression of the disease. Counseling for PD caregivers can be dispensed particularly effectively through individual psychological counseling as well as PD support and community self-help groups that assist caregivers in sharing concerns and promote a sense they are understood by others. Through such measures, which may be delivered effectively by nurse practitioners, PD caregivers can develop effective coping strategies for disease related stressors. Empirical results show the most common stressors are: anxiety, concern about the future, impatience or intolerance, loss of autonomy, sleep disturbances, diminished time and opportunity for recreation and social contact, and anger. These sequelae often ensue when the PD patient evidences depression, advanced dementia, or psychosis, each of which can severely constrain communication. Caregivers often must also contend with two other adverse psychological phenomena: cognitive dissonance surrounding placement of the patient in a nursing home and learned helplessness, which may predispose to depressive states. Other often unmet needs of the \"hidden victims\" of PD include compromised immune function, social stigmata, and financial difficulties. Respite care may be useful in reducing the stress associated with these and other problems frequently affecting caregivers.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

      "title": "Psychiatric Emergencies",
      "abstract": "By dictionary definition, an emergency is any sudden state of affairs which demands immediate action. In psychiatric terms there are at least three ways of looking at such an event: (1) the medical viewpoint. Doctors and hospitals are used to coping with physical emergencies in the course of their daily work. Therefore, when some abnormal mental state is the cause of the emergency the remedy is most frequently seen in terms of some form of medical intervention, usually implying the administration of drugs. (2) the psychological viewpoint. This is less concerned to classify overt symptoms and more willing to see the person in distress as somehow failing to cope with some stressful situation. This failure to cope may be due to the sheer size and impact of the stress or indicative of some breakdown of the usual defensive mechanisms, either because the ego is underdeveloped and therefore vulnerable, or because it has been undermined by illness. (3) the social worker's viewpoint. An emergency may be seen as being concerned less with the disturbance within one individual than with a breakdown within a system or a wider group. In these terms the focus shifts from a concern with one person and moves to a consideration of that person within the context of friends, neighbours and relatives.",

The present study investigated whether subclinical levels of anxiety were associated with sleep disturbance and daytime functioning in older adults who met diagnostic criteria for primary insomnia, and therefore did not meet criteria for depression or an anxiety disorder. After adjustment for depressive symptoms, elevated state anxiety was associated with higher levels of wake after sleep onset (measured by both actigraphy and sleep log) and shorter sleep onset latency (measured by sleep log). Higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with greater wake after sleep onset (measured by sleep log). Elevated state and trait anxiety were associated with worse social functioning, and higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with worse role functioning. Thus, subclinical anxiety symptoms may be an important target for clinical intervention to improve sleep and functioning in older adults with primary insomnia.",

      "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue: Sleep in Children with Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "For those clinicians and researchers who have chosen and embraced the challenges and rewards of working on a daily basis with children and families, the concept of ‘‘developmental context’’ is hardly a revelation. As with virtually any issue that pediatric practitioners confront in clinical settings or investigators examine in experimental settings or epidemiologic studies, sleep problems in childhood must be viewed in the context of normal physical and cognitive/emotional phenomena that are occurring at different developmental stages. For example, temporary regressions in sleep development often accompany the achievement of motor and cognitive milestones in the first year of life. Similarly, an increase in nighttime fears and night wakings in toddlers may be a temporary manifestation of developmentally normal separation anxiety peaking during that stage. In addition, sleep problems in the pediatric population must be viewed against a backdrop of the normal developmental trajectory across childhood and developmental norms; i.e., ‘‘normal’’ bedtime behavior, time to sleep onset, and sleep duration are obviously dramatically different in a 6-month old, 6-year old, and 16-year old. Finally, because the developmental continuum includes the transition into adulthood, insights into the prevalence, types, and impact of, as well as risk and protective factors for, sleep problems in childhood have direct relevance in regards to an increased understanding of sleep issues at all life stages. Despite the obvious importance of viewing sleep problems in both children and adults from a developmental perspective, the body of literature in developmental aspects of pediatric sleep research at this juncture is still relatively sparse. For example, there are surprisingly little large-scale epidemiological data currently available, which systematically define normal sleep and wakefulness patterns and sleep duration in the pediatric population. Most of the existing studies have utilized subjective, parentreport, retrospective, cross-sectional surveys in selected populations. Although cross-sectional studies yield important information regarding sleep in discrete age groups, by their nature they neither describe the evolution and persistence of sleep/wake patterns over time, nor do they help to elucidate the complex reciprocal relationship between sleep and cognitive/emotional development from the prenatal period through adolescence. There are even more limited data from studies utilizing more ‘‘objective’’ methods of measuring sleep quality and duration, such as polysomnography and actigraphy; and many of these studies were conducted prior to the establishment of accepted sleep monitoring and scoring standards. There are many potential reasons for this relative knowledge gap. First, as with many behavioral issues in childhood, the patient is rarely the one who presents with a chief complaint of a sleep problem. Thus, parental concerns and subjective observations regarding their child’s sleep patterns and behaviors often define sleep disturbances in the research, as well as in the clinical context. Parental recognition and reporting of sleep problems in children also varies across childhood, with parents of infants and toddlers more likely to be aware of sleep concerns than those of school-aged children and adolescents (and to report them to clinicians and researchers). Furthermore, the very definition of what behaviors constitute a sleep ‘‘problem’’ is often highly subjective and is frequently determined by the amount of disruption caused to parents’ sleep. Culturally based values and beliefs regarding the meaning, importance, and role of sleep in daily life, as well as culturally based differences in sleep practices (e.g., sleeping space and environment, solitary sleep vs. co-sleeping, use of transitional objects) also have a profound effect on how a parent",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are considered to be manifestations of the same nosologic continuum. It has been proposed that a sudden arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is the cause of these disorders. Benign forms of NREM arousal parasomnias occur frequently in childhood and attenuate in teen years; however, they can persist into or begin in adulthood. The available literature documents high levels of psychopathology in adult patients. Sleepwalking and night terrors are most likely to manifest during the first episode of slow wave sleep, but may also appear any time during NREM sleep. The hypersynchronous delta activity, previously considered to be a hallmark of somnambulism, has proven to be unspecific. Post-arousal EEG activity reveals altered consciousness during sleepwalking and sleep terror episodes. Pathophysiology of NREM arousal parasomnias consists of predisposing factors, which may be a genetically determined tendency for deep sleep, facilitating factors which deepen sleep and increase slow wave sleep, and triggering factors which increase sleep fragmentation, such as stress, environmental or endogenous stimuli, and stimulants. Recently published data on low delta power in the first sleep cycle and slow decline of delta power in successive sleep cycles suggest a chronic inability to sustain slow wave sleep.",

      "abstract": "Le Trouble Déficit de l’Attention/Hyperactivité (TDA/H) est un trouble fréquent de l’enfant à l’âge adulte. Dans ce trouble, la comorbidité est la règle. L’association avec les troubles du sommeil est décrite chez 25 % à 50 % des enfants et chez plus de la moitié des adultes présentant un TDA/H. La question de cette comorbidité pose question. En effet, Il n’est pas clair à l’heure actuelle si les troubles du sommeil sont intrinsèques au TDA/H ou s’ils se produisent à la suite d’un trouble primaire du sommeil sous-jacent. En effet, il est décrit des symptômes de « type TDA/H » dans certains troubles du sommeil primaires tels que les troubles respiratoires du sommeil, les mouvements périodiques des membres pendant le sommeil et le syndrome des jambes sans repos. De plus, la somnolence diurne excessive (l’un des symptômes de la narcolepsie et l’hypersomnie idiopathique) peut « mimer » des symptômes de TDA/H. Dès lors, la similitude de certains symptômes peut conduire à des erreurs diagnostiques entre troubles primaires du sommeil et TDA/H. Ainsi, nous nous proposons lors de ce symposium de faire un point sur les liens entre troubles du sommeil et TDA/H chez l’adulte : – en effectuant tout d’abord une revue de la littérature explorant la comorbidité entre ces différents troubles. Puis en présentant ensuite deux études originales sur ce thème en population adulte : – explorant d’une part, la comorbidité des hypersomnies (hypersomnie idiopathique et narcolepsie) chez les adultes TDA/H et la comorbidité TDA/H chez des adultes hypersomniaques ; – d’autre part, en explorant la somnolence diurne excessive objective par un test de maintien de l’éveil en population adulte TDA/H et l’impact de cette somnolence sur les performances de conduite des sujets (sur simulateur de conduite).",

      "abstract": "textabstractThe term migraine stems from hemicrania, describing a periodic disorder consisting of\nparoxysmal unilateral headache, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and/or\nphonophobia. Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a common cause of disturbed behaviour in medically ill people and is often undetected and poorly managed. It is a condition at the interface of medicine and psychiatry that is all too often owned by neither. Although various terms have been used to describe it—including acute confusional state, acute brain syndrome, and acute organic reaction delirium is the term used in the current psychiatric diagnostic classifications and the one we will use here. Delirium usually develops over hours to days. Typically, the symptoms fluctuate and are worse at night. The fluctuation can be a diagnostic trap, with nurses or relatives reporting that patients had disturbed behaviour at night whereas doctors find patients lucid the next day. Impaired cognitive functioning is central and affects memory, orientation, attention, and planning skills. Impaired consciousness, with a marked variability in alertness and in awareness of the environment is invariably present. A mistaken idea of the time of day, date, place, and identity of other people (disorientation) is common. Poor attention, and disturbed thought processes may be reflected in incoherent speech. This can make assessment difficult and highlights the need to obtain a history from a third party. Relatives or other informants may report a rapid and drastic decline from premorbid functioning that is useful in distinguishing delirium from dementia. Disturbed perception is common and includes illusions (misperceptions) and hallucinations (false perceptions). Visual hallucinations are characteristic and strongly suggest delirium. However, hallucinations in auditory and other sensory modalities can also occur. #### Diagnostic criteria fordelirium*",

In most cases, the trauma recalled was child sexual abuse, but in some cases the trauma was ritual abuse by satanic covens. Therapists who treat such patients theorize that memories of extremely traumatic events, especially of early sexual molestation, are so painful that they are barred from awareness by repression or dissociation.1 “Repressed” memories are those that are strictly forbidden to surface, while “dissociated” memories are allowed expression only when the patient is in an alternate state of mind, as in MPD. Whether in the context of MPD or another disorder, repressed or dissociated memories are thought to cause various symptoms, both mental and physical. Patients with repressed memories of childhood rape, for example, may fear intimacy with others or have undiagnosable pelvic pain.",

He receives IVIG and 60 mg diazepam as a treatment regimen. He referred to psychiatric clinic due to his nocturnal panic episodes. Regarding the case we want to investigate psychological problems in this rare syndrome. Rarity of disease make discussion and researches difficult, its prevalence is one individual among one million, so the analysis of patients’ history may be the best way of study. Phobias may be the most important disorders in these patients, as any noxious stimuli could provoke sever spasms, so patient may consciously automatically avoid specific situations such as steps, street, toilet etc. Avoidance could make patient phobic of being alone and being dependent on others. Patient may also experience degree of frustration and then often aggression toward others especially relatives. Depression anxiety and panic are other problems could be raised. The patient may think, the do not understand the situation. Rare syndromes potentially are accompanied by variety of psychological problems which should be tried to be understood and solved.",

      "abstract": "Insight is a multidimensional construct, defined as the awareness of having a mental disorder, of specific symptoms and their attribution to the disorder, the awareness of social consequences, and of need for treatment. Although insight has been studied specifically in schizophrenia and its study in mood disorders has traditionally received limited attention, the evaluation of this concept in mood disorders is also very important because of the impact on treatment compliance and outcome. In bipolar disorder (BD), clinical insight varies substantially over time. Most researchers observed that insight is more impaired during an illness episode than during remission, in mixed than in pure manic episodes, in bipolar II than in bipolar I patients, and in pure mania than in bipolar or unipolar depression. Lack of insight is a consistent factor of non-adherence to medication in bipolar patients, along with severity of BD, side effects of medication, effectiveness, and patient-related factors. Also, impaired insight into treatment and a great number of previous hospitalizations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes (psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, violent or suicidal behavior) among the patients with bipolar I disorder. In the management of bipolar disorder, improving quality of life (QoL) and outcome should be one the most important goals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

He simply confuses the matter by gratuitously suggesting that an alarm system has to be either off or maximally on. Clearly many physiological alarm systems produce mounting discomfort and activation but do not lead to a full-fledged maximum reaction unless adaptive action has failed to be effective. Ley obscures the issue by a physiologically unwarranted dictum about how alarm systems work. Central sleep apnea is a pathological feature of the breathing control mechanism; patients with central sleep apnea breathe insufficiently except during full wakefulness. Such patients are quite similar to patients with the Ondine curse, so this does not contradict my views. In obstructive sleep apnea, obesity or upper airway narrowing may result in hypoxia and hypercapnia, which may induce central apnea. During sleep apnea, the usual response",

      "abstract": "Sleep comprises one third of human life and is very important for maintaining healthy mental and physical states. Sleep disorders disturbing normal sleep are very common and may induce serious consequences. Sleep disorder medicine is based on the concept of two different states (waking and sleep) of the human brain. The problems of the waking conscious state affect sleep and problems during sleep also affect daytime mental and physical activities. The common symp-toms of patients with sleep disorders are excessive daytime sleepiness, a decrease in alertness, and fatigue. To detect sleep disorders, we should understand the physiology of normal sleep. Normal sleep consists of non-rapid eye movement (75% to 80%) and rapid eye movement (20% to 25%) sleep. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders second edition lists 77 different sleep disorders divided into 8 categories. Clinical approaches to sleep disorder patients should include detailed history taking including sleep history, a sleep questionnaire, sleep diary, physical examination including the nasal/oral cavities and airway, and neurological/psychological examination. The common sleep disorders are obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. We should learn the characteristic clinical features of each sleep disorder and how to detect and treat them. We need a more active effort to educate physicians about sleep disorder medicine and should try large sample, long-term, and prospective studiesto reveal the pathophysiology and enhance the treatment of sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are common, serious, and treatable. However, most patients with sleep disorders are underdiagnosed and not treated appropriately due to lack of knowledge of sleep disorder medicine. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea should focus more attention on and provide more support for timely diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.",

The term dizziness is used by patients to describe a variety of symptoms, including a hallucination of movement (vertigo), light-headedness, and a true appreciation of unsteadiness associated with gait disorders. Although there are age-related decrements in the somatosensory, visual, vestibular, and motor systems, dizziness should not be regarded as part of normal ageing. Diagnosis can usually be reached without specialist investigations, through focused history taking and bedside clinical assessment, including careful examination of eye movements and the Dix-Hallpike test. The underlying cause may be in one or several physiological systems and this will guide treatment plans. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and neuritis are more common than Meniere’s. The presence of red flag symptoms or signs suggesting central vestibular disease will require further imaging.",

Estimated prevalence rates in children and adolescents are about 1%.1 The distress to young people caused by the characteristic intrusive, unwanted, and often unpleasant thoughts or fears is often hidden, as children identify these symptoms as peculiar or embarrassing and keep them secret, sometimes for years. Likewise, compulsive behaviours such as washing or checking are usually perceived as unnecessary and often ridiculous, and children may go to great lengths to conceal them.\n\nThe psychopathology is strikingly similar to that seen in the adult disorder, and many adults diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder report that their symptoms first began in childhood.2 Parents, teachers, and primary care practitioners, as well as paediatricians and child psychiatrists, may well be familiar with the symptoms, …",

      "abstract": "Cancer is the most feared of diseases.Unsurprisingly, it causes considerable psychological distress in patients, families, carers, and often those health professionals who care for them.Only a minority of cancer patients develop psychiatric illness, but other psychologically and socially determined problems are common.These include unpleasant symptoms such as pain, nausea, and fatigue; problems with finances, employment, housing, and childcare; family worries; and existential and spiritual doubts.Well planned care that fully involves patients and their families can minimise these problems. Psychological consequencesThough often dismissed as \"understandable,\" distress is a treatable cause of reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcome.Some patients delay seeking help because they fear or deny their symptoms of distress.Presentation can be obvious, as depressed or anxious mood can manifest as increased severity of somatic complaints such as breathlessness, pain, or fatigue.Adjustment disorder is the commonest psychiatric diagnosis, and neuropsychiatric complications may occur.The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of coping with cancer. DepressionDepression is a response to perceived loss.A diagnosis of cancer and awareness of associated losses may precipitate feelings similar to bereavement.The loss may be of parts of the body (such as a breast or hair), the role in family or society, or impending loss of life.Severe and persistent depressive disorder is up to four times more common in cancer patients than in the general population, occurring in 10-20% during the disease. Anxiety, fear, and panicAnxiety is the response to a perceived threat.It manifests as apprehension, uncontrollable worry, restlessness, panic attacks, and avoidance of people and of reminders of cancer, together with signs of autonomic arousal.Patients may overestimate the risks associated with treatment and the likelihood of a poor outcome.Anxiety may also exacerbate or heighten perceptions of physical symptoms (such as breathlessness in lung cancer), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (with intrusive thoughts and avoidance of reminders of cancer) occasionally follow diagnosis or treatment that has been particularly frightening.Certain cancers and treatments are associated with specific fears.Thus, patients with head and neck cancers may worry about being able to breathe and swallow.Patients may develop phobias and conditioned vomiting in relation to unpleasant treatments such as chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of sleep disorders is approximately 50%, with an even higher occurrence in a psychiatric population. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness characterized by shifts in mood and activity. The BD syndrome also involves heterogeneous symptomatology, including cognitive dysfunctions and impairments of the autonomic nervous system. Sleep abnormalities are frequently associated with BD and are often a good predictor of a mood swing. Preservation of stable sleep-wake cycles is therefore a key to the maintenance of stability in BD, indicating the crucial role of circadian rhythms in this syndrome. The symptom most widespread in BD is insomnia, followed by excessive daytime sleepiness, nightmares, difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, poor sleep quality, sleep talking, sleep walking, and obstructive sleep apnea. Alterations in the structure or duration of sleep are reported in all phases of BD. Understanding the role of neuroglia in BD and in various aspects of sleep is in nascent state. Contributions of the different types of glial cells to BD and sleep abnormalities are discussed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Somatization disorder (SD) is a syndromatic classification that allows a physician to identify more easily patients with a lifelong history of chronic subjective physical complaints that are unverified by objective examinations either at the time of initial presentation or during the subsequent five years. The somaticizing process is believed to be an expression of emotional distress. The most common complaints of SD patients include recurrent pain (site and quality vary), conversion (pseudoneurologic) symptoms, nervousness or depression (or both), sexual and marital discord, and, often, menstrual difficulties. Such patients will generally have a history of repeated hospitalization or surgery. These symptoms are not perceived as mild or unimportant but lead to physician consultation, prescription drug use, and modification of life-style. Such patients are prone to \"doctor-shopping\" and self-medication and are at risk for many iatrogenic illnesses. Because they generally are resistant to psychologic explanations for their condition, management aimed at protecting them from the consequences of their behavior is important. A heightened threshold for instituting aggressive diagnostic and treatment procedures is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients are afflicted by a variety of sleep disorders. Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of reviewing the clinical history, behavior semiology, and diagnostic ancillary testing such as polysomnography with EEG monitoring in distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from other nocturnal complex behavior disorders and parasomnias.",

Previously, it was assumed that a single cause might explain these deaths. Subsequently, it has been found that several pathologic entities that are often virtually indistinguishable from SIDS can cause sudden death in infants. A commonly held concept is that for a SIDS death to occur, at least three conditions must be present, the so-called “triple-risk model.”1 First, the infant must have a congenital or acquired underlying vulnerability. Second, there must be a maturational process creating a peak age of vulnerability, occurring at age 2 to 6 months. Finally, a precipitating stress must be present that brings about the sudden death, generally assumed to be cardiovascular or respiratory in origin. Given these concepts, there has been great interest in discovering the source of underlying vulnerability, either physiologic …",

When nonpharmacologic interventions fail, patients often request and may even require treatment with hypnotics. Insomnia is a heterogeneous disorder. Patients with insomnia may have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking too early. Sleep disturbances are especially common in older people because of changes in sleep architecture. Though this population may benefit from hypnotics to improve sleep, these drugs increase the risk of polypharmacy, drug interactions, and adverse drug effects, such as falls and cognitive impairment. Pharmacists must consider patient-specific factors to ensure older patients who require hypnotics receive an appropriate drug for an appropriate duration.",

In contrast, lucid dreaming allows to become aware of the current state of mind, often accompanied by considerable control over the ongoing dream episode. Lucid dreams can happen spontaneously or be induced through diverse behavioural, cognitive or technological strategies. Such induction techniques have spurred research into the potential therapeutic aspects of lucid dreams. In this review, we gather evidence on the link between lucid dreams and conditions like nightmare disorder, depression, anxiety, psychosis, and dissociative states, and highlight the possible neurobiological basis of these associations. Furthermore, we explore contemplative sleep practices that train lucid states during sleep, such as Dream/Sleep Yoga and Yoga Nidrâ. The potential drawbacks of lucid dreaming interventions are outlined, accompanied by an examination of the impacts of lucid dreams on individuals without clinical conditions. By shedding light on these intricate relationships, the review contributes to a deeper understanding of the therapeutic possibilities and implications of lucid dreaming.",

Baby blues, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders, are changes that can occur in the puerperium period. The mildest ant the most common difficulty is baby blues or postpartum grief, which last for a short time and passes without consequence for the mther and her child. In the most cases treatment is not required, support from the environment and the family is enough. Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that needs to be treated.\r\n Simptoms of postpartum depression are feelings of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, restlessness, etc. Treatment includes pharmacoterapy for alternative procedures.\r\n Postpartum psychosis is rare but the most serious form of postpartum disorders and can have very serious consequences for the mother and her child (even fatal outcome is possible). It is treated with pharmacotherapy and alternative methods, but sometimes requires hospitalization in the department of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders, that is divided into panic disorders, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress disorders and other specific phobias. The cause of anxiety disorders are mainly genetic factors, unwanted pregnancies, unprepared mothers for the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. A large role in the prevention of mental health problems is played by a health visitor whose task is to educate women and their families, before and after birth and contribute with advice and skills to overcome postpartum stress and inital adjustment. During the preparation of the final survey was conducted trought social network Facebook („MeĊimurske mame i trudnice“, etc.) collected was 134 responses from April to May 2019. Results have shown 67,9% of participants did not have any psychological changes after birth. Nevertheless, 32,3% have manifested certain psychological changes, with baby blues being the most common ( 17,2%) followed by postpartum depression (7,5%) and anxiety disorder (6%). The age itself does not affect the change, while understanding and family support do. Quality education and awareness of the mother is very important , but it is important that the information is verified and accurate. The role of a health visitor, throught her education and advice, can prevent and identify certain difficulties in a timely manner is crucial and of great importance.",

      "title": "Epileptic Seizures Detection Based on Empirical Mode Decomposition of EEG Signals",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects more than 50 million people world wide, characterized by recurrent seizures (World Health Organization [WHO], 2006).An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain (Fisher et al., 2005& Berg et al., 2010).This electrical hyperactivity can have its source in different parts of the brain and produces physical symptoms such as short periods of inattention and loose of memory, a sensory hallucination, or a whole-body convulsion.The frequency of these events can vary from one in a year to several in a day.The majority of the patients suffer from unpredictable, persistent and frequent seizures which limit the independence of an individual, increase the risk of serious injury and mobility, and result in both social isolation and economic hardship (Friedman & Gilliam, 2010).In addition, the patients with epilepsy have an increased mortality risk of approximately 2 to 3 times that of the general population (Ficker, 2000).The first line of treatment for epilepsy is with multiple anti-epileptic drugs and it is effective in about 70% of the cases.From the 30% remaining affected individuals only less than 10% could benefit from surgical therapy leaving a 20% of the total of people with epilepsy who will continue suffering sudden, incontrollable seizures and for whom other forms of treatment are being investigated (Theodore & Ficker, 2004; WHO, 2006).For any of the reasons exposed before the seizure detection is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy and for the seizures control.In the clinical practice this detection basically involves visual scanning of Electroencephalogram (EEG) long recordings by the physicians in order to detect and classify the seizure activity present in the EEG signal.Usually these are multichannel records of 24 to 72 hours length which implies a very time consuming task and it is also kwon that the conclusions are very subjective so disagreement between physicians are not rare.The seek here is to detect automatically in long term EEG records those segments of the signal that present epileptic seizures for the shake of reducing the high amount of information to be analyzed by the neurologists.Thus them could focus their attention in these part of the information so a more precisely and quick diagnosis can be made.Seizure detection is also a useful tool for treatments s u c h u s t i m e l y d r u g d e l i v e r y , e l e c t r i c a l stimulation and seizure alert systems.Automated seizure detection, quantification and recognition have been of interest of the biomedical community researchers since the 1970s.In some initial works a number of www.intechopen.com How to referenceIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

      "abstract": "Research indicates that a segment of the lawyer population is impaired by mental illness, such as anxiety, depression, substance misuse, or suicide risk. A much higher number of lawyers likely fall on the languishing end of the mental health spectrum. If you are languishing, you may be at a higher risk of sliding into impairment. Mental health is assessed on a continuum, ranging from languishing to flourishing. Languishing has been described as feeling uninspired, joyless, and lacking the power to function at full capacity. And languishing may increase your risk of mental illness, such as major depressive episode, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, or substance use disorder. Lawyers may suffer from several obstacles to mental strength, including lack of self-awareness, perfectionism, imposter syndrome, social comparisons, trained pessimism, inability to regulate emotions, and inauthenticity from a failure to understand or leverage their temperament and personality strengths. Features of the lawyering culture may augment these obstacles and lead to lawyer languishing.",

      "title": "A transient personality disorder induced by football matches.",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are a class of mental diseases characterized by inflexible and maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience, involving several areas of functioning, such as affectivity, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking and reaction to stress factors. In the literature, personality disorders have always been described as stable patterns of long duration, and their onset can be found during adolescence or early adulthood. These patterns are associated with significant distress or impairment in a patient's life in which a main element affects every aspect of living, and in which no biological or other pathologies exist to assist in its identification. Therefore, they often lead to comorbidities such as dysfunctional anxiety, drug abuse, major depression and suicide.We present a case of a 37-year-old man, who came to the outpatient department needing support to quit smoking. During the follow up, he described some transitory changes in his personality while watching football (soccer) games. These episodes were characterized by inappropriate anger crises, rapid and dramatic shifts in emotional tone, dysphoria and superstitious and magical beliefs with paranoid elements; connecting himself, his family and friends to players in the match and to the unfolding of the game. Every manifestation was induced by the football match, and there were no signs of difficulty in handling impulses and in managing relationships, or any superstitious beliefs, outside of it.The combination of all the symptoms led us to think about a diagnosis of the borderline personality disorder. There was a lack of managing impulsivity, intense uncontrollable emotional reactions, and episodes of psychotic decompensation with unreal and paranoid connections made between the patient's entourage and the results of the match.With this case, we propose to consider the personality disorder, not just as a stable and inflexible pattern, but also as a transitory dysfunction induced by stress factors, as in this case, a football match, introducing therefore a new entity: transient personality disorder.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric disorders: post-stroke depression. A review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder after stroke, and also the main factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients, which leaded to poor quality of life. A prevalence of 30% is estimated between 1 to 5 years after stroke. More than half of all cases are neither diagnosed nor treated. Objectives The aim of this paper is to review the latest updates regarding post-stroke depression and progress in its diagnosis and treatment. Methods A systematic review of the scientific and clinical literature on PSD was conducted. The review included databases such as PubMed and Cochrane, covering articles from the past 10 years. The scientific evidence obtained was analyzed and synthesized. Results Currently, the diagnosis of PSD is mainly based on the DSM guidelines and combined with various depression scales. Symptoms usually occur within the first three months after stroke, the patient presents symptoms of a depressive episode such as low mood, anhedonia, loss of appetite, sleep disorders, vegetative symptoms or social withdrawal. Several mechanisms, including biological, behavioural, and social factors, are involved in its pathogenesis. The main predictors are personal history or cognitive impairment, as well as sequelae of the stroke. Left hemispheric strokes are those with the highest risk of early depression, as well as small subcortical vessel pathology. Treatment is mainly pharmacological, with SSRIs. The probability of recovery is between 15 and 57% in the first year, with a recurrence of 38% at two years, up to 100% at 15 years. In addition, there is an increase in mortality, especially in those under 65 years of age. Conclusions There are still many unanswered questions in the treatment of PSD, such as the best time to start treatment or the effects of antidepressants on cognition and motor function, among others. Although great advance has been made by researchers, the mechanism of PSD is not completely clear. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Depression: some proposals for future research.",
      "abstract": "The argument has been advanced that pathological states of anxiety and mania are both characterized by a failure on the part of the patient to attach appropriate levels of significance to changes occurring in the immediate environment. There is, it is suggested, a tendency for environmental features to be regarded as important even though, viewed objectively, they may have little relevance to the patient and his needs. Depression, it is further proposed, may be viewed as an extreme defense reaction to the intense anxiety which results from attaching too much significance to environmental events. In depressive state, patients are often characterised by their lowered responsiveness to stimulation and their lack of interest in, or concern about, their surroundings: it may be that, in such state, information processing has been blocked or reduced. The daytime drowsiness of the depressed patients, as well as his night-time sleep disturbance and the frequently observed recurrent or cyclic nature of certain kinds of depressed state, suggest that this blocking of sensory processing may be brought about by the involuntary intervention of mechanisms responsible, under normal circumstances, for sleep induction. This view of the nature of depression has been recast into the form of five potentially testable hypotheses. Speculation is always easy; providing convincing demonstrations that those speculations are reasonable is less easy. It is in the nature of psychological investigation that laboratory-based studies distort and may even destroy the phenomena about which information is sought, and many a perfectly reasonable theory has foundered upon the rocks of translation into experimental terms. In those areas of psychology which have implications for psychiatry and the conceptualisation of psychopathological states, this danger is particularly evident: psychiatric syndromes are complex, variable, and have social referrents, but laboratory experiments are limited in their capacity to reflect all these attributes, and consequently they may never provide really adequate tests of a theory about a psychiatric state. We have to try to come to terms with this apparent impasse--in the first place by being circumspect in translating psychiatric concepts into experimental terms, and secondly by exercising caution in interpreting the results to which the experiments give rise. More importantly, however, we have to accept the essential inadequacy of the majority of experimental paradigms in psychiatric research and to regard theorizing--even when it is not linked to explicitly testable hypotheses--as having inherent value.",

Apart from acute or chronic diseases which may produce sleep disorders, most of these are due to environmental factors. Two syndrome are worthy of special mention: deficiency of slow wave and deep sleep in psychosocial dwarfism, and insomnia due to intolerance to cow's milk.

One of the most common complaints of parents of infants and toddlers is that their child either has difficulty going to bed or wakes multiple times per night. These nightly struggles can leave parents tired, frustrated, and very stressed. Sleep-onset associations are certain conditions that are necessary for a child to fall asleep at bedtime and then return to sleep with each normal arousal during the night. Limit-setting sleep disorder presents as bedtime stalling or refusal to go to bed at an appropriate time. When limits are set, children typically fall asleep quickly and easily. Behavioral insomnia of childhood impacts not only the functioning and behavior of the child, but also the entire household. Sleep problems in children also negatively impact parents and caregivers.",

      "abstract": "Respiratory muscle weakness is a common feature of many neuromuscular disorders contributing to the development of daytime respiratory failure. However sleep-related breathing abnormalities and sleep disturbance can occur months or years before the emergence of daytime hypercapnia. Although obstructive events are commonly seen in the early stages of many disorders with age and disease progression central events and nocturnal hypoventilation occur. Patients may complain of unrefreshing sleep daytime sleepiness and impaired concentration although these symptoms can develop insidiously and be overlooked or mistaken as features of primary disease process. As management of neuromuscular disorders is primarily supportive not curative therapeutic intervention must be directed towards managing symptoms and maintaining quality of life. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been convincingly shown to improve physiologic parameters and extend survival in patients with a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders. Although an improvement in symptoms once therapy is commenced is frequently reported the impact on sleep quality and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has received far less attention. Assessing quality of life is essential to evaluate the financial and human costs and benefits of therapy. Health professionals frequently underestimate the quality of life in patients with neuromuscular disorders and significant disability and this can affect the type of therapeutic options that are offered to patients. As sleep quality has been shown to be a major determinant of global quality of life in patients with chronic respiratory failure evaluating sleepiness specific sleep-related quality of life issues and neuropsychological function should be undertaken routinely before the institution of home ventilation and during follow up.",

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

      "abstract": "Delirium oppstår oftest etter kirurgi og under intensivbehandling, og er en akutt forvirringstilstand på grunn av forstyrrelser i hjernens funksjoner. Patofysiologien er uklar, men delirium har en identifiserbar organisk årsak. Forløpet er fluktuerende og kan utvikle seg over tid. Symptomene kan være desorientering, hukommelsessvikt, hallusinasjoner og persepsjonsforstyrrelser (1). Pasientene blir svært sårbare fordi de har redusert evne til å ta del i, påvirke, eller kontrollere egen situasjon (2). Intensivmiljøet inneholder fysiske, psykiske og miljømessige faktorer som kan utløse et delirium, for eksempel respiratorbehandling, sedasjon, alvorlighetsgrad av kritisk sykdom, mangel på døgnrytme og farmakologisk påvirkning. Predisponerende faktorer som demens eller kognitiv dysfunksjon, depresjon, alvorlig sykdom eller komorbiditet er også tilstede hos pasienten før sykehusinnleggelse (3, 4). Det er rapportert om delirium hos nær 87% av alle respiratorbehandlede pasienter. Ubehandlet delirium kan påvirke pasientens kliniske tilstand, og føre til redusert kontinuitet i behandlingen, lengre behandlingstid, økte kostnader og i verste fall økt mortalitet (5). Pasientens adferd deles inn i hyperaktivt og hypoaktivt delirium, eller en kombinasjon av begge tilstandene. Hyperaktivt delirium er klassisk beskrevet som at pasienten er aggressive og utagerende, og ute av stand til å samarbeide. Hypoaktivt delirium viser seg ved svekket oppmerksomhet og bevissthet, og nedsatt psykomotorisk aktivitet. Det er høyest forekomst av pasienter i hypoaktivt delirium. På grunn av vage symptomer er det vanskeligere å avdekke. Dette fører til at langtidsprognosen for pasienter med hypoaktivt delirium er dårlig (5, 6). Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) er et validert kartleggingsverktøy som benyttes for å avdekke tilstanden hos intuberte pasienter som ikke kan kommunisere verbalt (4, 7, 8). Rutinemessig screening med et slikt kartleggingsverktøy for å avdekke delirium er anbefalt. Likevel viser forskning at tilstanden er underdiagnostisert (9, 10).",

      "abstract": "Depression is the third most common illness among patients with schizophrenia which negatively affects the course of the disease and significantly contributes to the mortality rate, due to increased suicide. Depression, along with negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, is one of the main factors that significantly decreases the quality of life and the disease prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, depression increases the frequency of exacerbations and readmissions, decreases the quality and duration of remissions and is associated with more frequent substance abuse and an increased economic burden. Data on the prevalence of depression among patients with schizophrenia are contradictory and are associated with a low detection rate of depression in such patients, a lack of clear diagnostic criteria and difficulties in differentiation between extrapyramidal and negative symptoms. The average prevalence of depression that meets the diagnostic criteria of major depressive episodes in patients with schizophrenia is 25% at a specific point, and 60% over the course of a lifetime; the frequency of subsyndromal depression is much higher. It is essential to distinguish between primary (axial syndrome) and secondary depressive symptoms (extrapyramidal symptoms, psychogenic or nosogenic reactions, social factors, etc.) to determine treatment strategies. The published data relating to randomized clinical trials for the development of evidence-based guidelines are limited. Current recommendations are based mainly on the results of small-scale trials and reviews. Certain atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, lurasidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, clozapine) are superior to typical antipsychotics in the reduction of depressive symptoms. Clozapine is effective in the management of patients at risk from suicide. The additional prescription of antidepressants, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy are not always effective and are only possible following the management of acute psychosis in cases when antipsychotic monotherapy proved to be ineffective.",

Refreshing sleep requires both quality and quantity, so much so that an inadequacy of either leads to overall higher mortality rates. Numerous studies have sited significant changes in sleep that typically occur with aging and primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger patients. As many as half of persons over 65 have some complaint relating to sleep. There is a high prevalence of insomnia in the elderly population and elderly patients also frequently suffer from sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, periodic leg movement disorder, circadian rhythm disturbances, narcolepsy, and rapid eye movement behavior disorder. Unfortunately, sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. The aim of this article is to review normal sleep, sleep and the major causes of sleep disturbances in the elderly. Attention has been given to diagnosis and appropriate interventions, since sleep disturbances left untreated can have significant negative impact in terms of life expectancy, general health outcome and quality of life.

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

The frequency of headache has been substantially increased over the last 30 years due to changes in lifestyle. Controlling the trigger factors and lifestyle changes (e.g. regular sleep, meal time, exercise, etc.) are the first step management strategies in headaches. Sleep and headache have bidirectional effects on each other. While diminished and poor quality of sleep can be a trigger factor for headache (e.g. migraine and tension-type headache (TTH)), some types of headache like hypnic headache and cluster-type headache mainly occur during sleep. Patients with headache may have poor sleep quality, reduced total sleep time, more awakenings, and alterations in architecture of sleep recorded by polysomnography. Progression to chronic forms of headache may also be associated with the duration and quality of sleep. Even though pathophysiology of headache and sleep disorders shares the same brain structures and pathways, sleep disturbances are commonly underestimated and underdiagnosed in headache patients. Clinicians should consider and behold the treatment of accompanying sleep complaints for an effective management of headache.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

      "abstract": "While REM sleep is the phase of sleep from which dream reports are most reliably elicited, dream reports can also be elicited from any other stage of sleep, including sleep onset and N3 SWS. Reports after awakenings from NREM stages of sleep tend to be shorter, less emotional, and less visually vivid than reports obtained from REM – but we do get reports of “dreams” from NREM sleep states. Indeed, you can get dream reports without REM when REM is chemically suppressed via antidepressant medications. Just as dreams can occur without REM, REM sleep can occur without dream reports. About 20 percent of awakenings after a REM episode results in no dream report. Activation of REM, therefore, does not necessarily eventuate in a dream or at least a dream report. In addition, children who have abundant REM do not consistently report dreams until visuo-spatial and cognitive skills have matured enough to support reporting of visual narratives (Foulkes, 1982). Similarly, patients with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and near the occipitotemporoparietal junction sometimes report complete cessation of dreaming (Solms, 1997). In addition, Solms emphasized that disconnection of the ascending meso-limbic-cortical dopaminergic tracts from their termination sites in ventromedial frontal lobes could also lead to the loss of dreaming. Given that this tract is associated with instinctual appetitive drive and motivational states, it seems reasonable to conclude that this dopaminergic system may participate in the generation of some dreams. The loss of dreaming in these patients is not due simply to an inability to recall dreams, as their basic memory and recall abilities are largely intact. REM physiology as measured by sleep EEG is normal in these individuals, thus REM is still operating.",

The author's submission is that pathological mourning is present in all patients with AI disease, and that other events such as those mentioned are only precipitant because they uncover mourning until then kept in check by occupation and use of work as a drug. When time for reflection and loneliness allows long suppressed ambivalent feelings, guilt and bitterness to surface, remorse over 'unfinished business' increasingly dominates the patient's thoughts. Children and young people rarely have the opportunity to mourn, thus early loss is often paramount and is awakened from the unconscious years later when further losses of key figures or surrogates, including pets, occur or are anticipated.

The worrisome factors include recent head or neck injury; a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt-onset headache; headache brought on by exertion or Valsalva maneuver/cough; new headache in the patient over the age of 50; neurological symptoms and/or abnormal signs; systemic symptoms and/or signs; and secondary risk factors such as a history of cancer or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, side-locked headaches, and prominent effect of change in posture on the pain.

      "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is among the most common mental health conditions. Up to 20% of people are af-fected by anxiety problems each year. An ongoing feeling of overwhelm, fear, and concern are signs of general-ised anxiety disorder. Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by excessive, irrational, and persistent worry about everyday issues. This worry may have several aspects, including financial, family, health, and future con-cerns. Most people with GAD also have additional mental diseases, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disor-der, significant depression, or particular phobia. Generalised anxiety disorder can affect both adults and children. The sickness often begins in infancy or adolescence but can begin at any age. GAD is twice as common in women and those assigned female at birth as it is in men and those assigned male at birth. Charaka stated the Manasavikara (mental disorder) Chittodvega (anxiety), which is said to be the ideal word to highlight the state of anxiety, namely generalised anxiety disorder. Both as a distinct illness and as a contributing component to other psychological and psychosomatic disorders, Chittodvega can occur. According to clinical investigations, anxiolytic medications by themselves have limited long-term effectiveness, and serious side effects such as se-dation, drug dependency, and resistance cannot be avoided. Ayurveda takes a psychosocial approach to medi-cine. Acharya Charaka describes three forms of treatment for mental and physical illnesses: Satwavajaya Chikitsa (Psychotherapy), Yuktivyapashraya (Rational therapy), and Daivavyapashraya (Spiritual therapy). Apart from these, we can also treat mental illness through counselling. Thus, the current study examines Chittodvega from the Ayurvedic classics and how to handle it.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is simply a reversible behavioral state of low attention to the environmental typically accompanied by a relaxed posture and some minimal movement. Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition and carries significant burden in terms of functional impairment, health care costs, and increased risk of depression. Worldwide epidemiological studies assessed the prevalence of insomnia without restrictive criteria as 33% in general population. Insomnia may be the primary problem, or it may be associated with other conditions. Insomnia can be caused by physical factors along with psychological factors. Extreme wake leads to energy consumption, hunger, and increase appetite and if reaches the limit to be called insomnia, digestion is not performed completely. Many prescribed drugs can interfere with sleep, like certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or vital sign. Many over-the-counter medications—like some pain medications, allergy and cold medications, and weight-loss products—contain caffeine and other stimulants which will disrupt sleep. This section will review common causes of sleep deprivation as well as the prevalence of sleep disorders among college students, and the influence of sleep disorders on sleepiness",

      "title": "Treatment options for situational anxiety in the neurology physician practice",
      "abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by high stress levels, which inevitably leads to neuroticism and psychopathization of the population. Emotional stress and the anxiety that follows it can be the cause and provocateur of some pathological processes and diseases. Unlike normal anxiety, intended to adapt the body, protect it and preserve life, pathological anxiety is inadequate to the intensity of the threat, is long-lasting, severe, and disrupts the quality of a person’s life and his activities. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by stress leads to the development of psycho-vegetative syndrome – a complex of somatic, vegetative, and mental symptoms. However, in clinical practice, doctors usually encounter the fact that the patient more often presents various multisystem somatic complaints, ignoring emotional experiences. Undiagnosed anxiety can lead to chronicity or relapse of the disease, the prescription of only symptomatic therapy and aggravation of the course of the missed anxiety disorder. For a doctor to qualitatively assess the clinical picture, it is necessary to understand the structure of autonomic dysfunction in various systems and “recognize” the manifestations of anxiety. Managing such patients, especially comorbid ones, is a complex task, the solution of which will be most effective through joint efforts with psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, art therapy, music therapy, medications are an integral part of the therapy for this category of patients. Psychotropic drugs can reduce both anxiety and vegetative symptoms. For subclinical anxiety disorder with somatic manifestations, herbal sedatives or drugs based on them are used in outpatient practice, which have a favorable safety profile with sufficient effectiveness. The drug of choice may be Valocordin, which has sedative, antispasmodic, and hypnotic effects, which corresponds to the goals of treating psychovegetative syndrome.",

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

The symptoms of narcolepsy are often misinterpreted, and frequently patients go for a decade or more without a correct diagnosis. Currently there are considered to be three forms of narcolepsy: narcolepsy with cataplexy; narcolepsy without cataplexy; and symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy, which is secondary to a central nervous system disease or injury.

      "abstract": "Considerable attention has been paid to individuals showing social maladjustment as well as withdrawal from social situations and activity, a state referred to as \"Hikikomori\" in Japanese. Recently, social maladjustment and Hikikomori states have also been noted to be highly prevalent among individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), which involve abnormalities in social interactions and communication. The individuals with PDDs report a tendency to sleep and wake at irregular or inappropriate times and to suffer from sleep disorders by nature, and they tend to sleep at extreme late night or during the day while experiencing social maladjustment and Hikikomori states. Therefore, it is probable that their oral hygiene might deteriorate due to a circadian rhythm disorder, such as an abnormal salivary secretion rhythm or refusals and noncooperation of dental care due to mood/emotional and social problems, underlying and caused by their sleep and wake patterns. In this review, we describe the importance of regular lifestyle, especially regular sleep–wake rhythm with appropriately timed bright light exposure during daytime, for management of oral health in PDDs via improving their circadian rhythm disorders.",

Sleep disturbances influence many behavioral and physiologic processes, leading to health complications including death. On the other hand, sleep improvement can beneficially influence the course of healing of many disorders and can be a prognostic of health recovery. The factors influencing sleep have different biological and chemical origins. They are classical hormones, hypothalamic releasing and inhibitory hormones, neuropeptides, peptides and others as cytokines, prostaglandins, oleamid, adenosine, nitric oxide. These factors regulate most physiologic processes and are likely elements integrating sleep with physiology and physiology with sleep in health and disorders.",

Night terrors do not take place in sleep, though they are initiated out of it, but in a dissociated state characterised by a waking alpha rhythm during which the subject is disoriented and may be delusional or hallucinating. Some children never attain the ability because of a lack of containment of their disorganised and often traumatising experiences. D. W.

      "abstract": "Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients almost uniformly suffer from sleep disruption. Even though the role of sleep disturbances is not still adequately understood, they may be related to metabolic, immune, neurological and respiratory dysfunction and could worsen the quality of life after discharge. A harsh ICU environment, underlying disease, mechanical ventilation, pain and drugs are the main reasons that underlie sleep disruption in the critically ill. Polysomnography is the gold standard in evaluating sleep, but it is not feasible in clinical practice; therefore, other objective (bispectral index score [BIS] and actigraphy) and subjective (nurse and patient assessment) methods have been proposed, but their adequacy in ICU patients is not clear. Frequent evaluation of neurological status with validated tools is necessary to avoid excessive or prolonged sedation in order to better titrate patient-focused therapy. Hypnotic agents like benzodiazepines can increase total sleep time, but they alter the physiological progression of sleep phases, and decrease the time spent in the most restorative phases compared to the phases normally mediated by melatonin; melatonin production is decreased in critically ill patients, and as such, exogenous melatonin supplementation may improve sleep quality. Sleep disruption and the development of delirium are frequently related, both because of sleep scarcity and inappropriate dosing with sedatives. Delirium is strongly related to increased ICU morbidity and mortality, thus the resolution of sleep disruption could significantly contribute to improved ICU outcomes. An early evaluation of delirium is strongly recommended because of the potential to resolve the underlying causes or to begin an appropriate therapy. Further studies are needed on the effects of strategies to promote sleep and on the evaluation of better sleep in clinical outcomes, particularly on the development of delirium.",

Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes, and it is reported that poorer quality of life and medical, neurological, and psychiatric comorbidities disrupt sleep. Sleep difficulties may result from multiple etiologies; however, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying chronic insomnia disorder are not sufficiently understood. Recently, numerous neuroimaging studies have been conducted to investigate the structural or functional derangement in the brains of patients with chronic insomnia disorder. The development of neuroimaging techniques has provided insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms that make patients with chronic sleep disturbances vulnerable to cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "Dizziness and vertigo are common complaints.The terms cover various sensations, and the distinction between the two is not clear.Careful inquiry into the patient's history is ofparamount importance as this may establish the diagnosis when examination yields normal results.Vertigo indicates vestibular dysfunction and is usually defined as a sense of rotation of either the patient or his environment.This rigid definition, however, excludes patients with vestibular dys- function who feel only a sensation of imbalance or disequilibrium in the head.Imbalance felt in the legs usually results from a cerebellar or proprioceptive deficit or from weakness of the legs.Dizziness, a feeling of impending loss of consciousness, is usually vascular in origin.Postural hypotension, cardiac dysrrhythmia such as in Adams-Stokes disease, low cardiac output resulting from valvular disease, or ventricular dysfunction may all present in this manner.The remainder of patients with dizziness may describe their symptoms in vague terms, such as \"light headedness,\" \"a fear of falling,\" or \"a swimming sensation\"; a common aetiology here is emotional disturbance.Vertigo of acute onset, and particularly when the labyrinth is affected, is characteristically rotatory and often associated with constitutional upset such as nausea, vomiting, or sweating.If the onset is gradual central compensation can occur and disequilibrium is the predominant complaint.The clinician should ask about symptoms of middle ear disease, deafness, tinnitus, headache, or focal neurological dysfunction and ascertain whether symptoms are provoked by specific movements-for example, of the head or neck-or changes of posture.The duration of symptoms and any particular pattern of recurrence should be established.Many drugs may cause dizziness and, less commonly, vertigo.Drugs that are directly vestibulotoxic, such as aminoglycosides, tend to cause disequilibrium as damage is predominantly bilateral.Rotatory vertigo, however, may occasionally develop as a result of unilateral toxicity.The inappropriate use of labyrinthine sedatives may aggravate dizziness, particularly in elderly people.Examination should be directed by history.Anaemia or polycythaemia may be apparent.The ears should be carefully examined, hearing tested, and tuning fork tests performed.The eyes should be examined closely for nystagmus or ocular paresis and the pupillary responses and corneal reflexes tested.Fundoscopy may show such abnormalities as papilloedema, papillitis, or optic atrophy.Positional testing for nystagmus and vertigo should be performed as follows.The patient sits upright on a couch with his gaze fixed on the examiner's forehead; his head is then briskly and simultaneously rotated through 450 and lowered to 30°below horizontal beyond the end of the couch.Both directions of rotation are tested and the eyes scrutinised for nystagmus.There are two positive responses.Most commonly, severe vertigo and nystagmus towards the lower ear",

      "title": "How once-nightly sodium oxybate is processed in the body in healthy volunteers: a plain language summary",
      "abstract": "What is this summary about? This is a plain language summary of an article originally published in the journal Sleep Medicine. Narcolepsy is a sleep condition in which people have periods of extreme sleepiness during the day. People with narcolepsy may also have symptoms of muscle weakness (cataplexy); seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that seems real but isn't actually there before falling asleep or while waking up (hallucinations); an inability to move before falling asleep or while waking up (sleep paralysis); and poor sleep at night. Sodium oxybate (SXB for short) has been used to treat narcolepsy for over 20 years. For more than 20 years, the only available form of SXB needed to be taken twice each night. Twice-nightly SXB (TN-SXB) requires people to take the first dose at bedtime. Most people fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Patients then need to wake up and take the second dose of TN-SXB 2.5 to 4 hours later, which is when most of the medicine has left the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) approved a once-nightly form of SXB called LUMRYZ ™ (sodium oxybate for extended-release oral suspension; ON-SXB for short) in May 2023. ON-SXB treats excessive daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness, also known as cataplexy. People with narcolepsy who take ON-SXB only need to take 1 dose at bedtime. This summary describes a study that looked at how ON-SXB enters, travels through, and exits the body of healthy volunteers (people without narcolepsy). The study measured the amount of SXB in the blood after taking SXB in 2 different ways: as a once-nightly version and as a twice-nightly version. Looking at the amount of ON-SXB and TN-SXB in the blood at different time points helps researchers see if people who take the 2 medicines, with different dosing, have the same amount of drug in the body overnight. What were the results? Overall, the study found that healthy volunteers had the same amount of SXB in their bodies after taking ON-SXB as they did after taking TN-SXB. When they took the same amounts of ON-SXB and TN-SXB, the SXB stayed in their bodies for similar amounts of time. The highest amount and the total amount of SXB in the participants' blood were similar with ON-SXB and TN-SXB. The amount of SXB in the participants' blood 8 hours after taking the medicine was significantly lower with ON-SXB than with TN-SXB. This means that people taking ON-SXB will have less medication in their blood when they wake up the next morning and may be less groggy. What do the results mean? The results mean that if people with narcolepsy take the same dose amount of ON-SXB or TN-SXB, their bodies will receive the same amount of SXB in their blood. ON-SXB provides an option for people with narcolepsy to take their medicine once at bedtime without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose, which can improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders is a common problem that patients report to their doctor. They can accompany many mental and somatic disorders or be primary. There are many types of sleep disorders; most commonly, they are associated with problems with falling asleep and maintaining sleep continuity, or more complex disorders, such as parasomnias, breathing disorders and movement disorders associated with sleep. In the following work, we have focused on sleep problems in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These patients more often than healthy people of the same age complain about sleep disorders and these dis­orders increase with the progress of the disease and the appearance of other symptoms. Depressed mood, chronic fatigue, pain and urinary problems significantly affect the quality of sleep in patients with MS. On the other hand, excessive sleepiness and trouble with falling asleep intensify the feeling of fatigue, which is a major problem and impair cognitive functions. However, sleep-related symptoms are often overlooked during medical visits due to other symptoms of multiple sclerosis, especially those causing motor disability. The treatment of sleep disorders in patients with MS is based on basic methods used in the general population. In the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis, appropriate disease modifying therapy is also important.",

      "title": "Electrodiagnostic Evaluation Of Critical Illness Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "As medicine advances, more critically ill patients are surviving longer ICU admissions. Patients with sepsis, multi-organ failure, severe burns, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and polypharmacy often develop profound neuromuscular weakness during their hospitalization despite appropriate medical interventions and treatments. Often referred to as “intensive care unit acquired weakness” (ICUAW) this underdiagnosed condition most commonly results from a spectrum of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), or a combination of both. While CIP and CIM often occur simultaneously, it is important to understand the key features of each condition to ensure prompt recognition, prevent further disability, and ensure better patient outcomes. While the conditions are often underdiagnosed, studies show that the incidence of ICUAW in patients with greater than seven days of mechanical ventilation may range from 25% to 83%. Critical illness neuropathy may be evident as a patient fails to wean off the ventilator or if the patient has profound weakness or numbness in extremities upon awakening from sedation. A physical exam may also reveal diminished deep tendon reflexes, possible muscle atrophy, or balance impairment upon leaving the ICU. Bulbar and extraocular muscles will often be spared in CIP. Laboratory studies such as cerebrospinal fluid will usually be normal; this may help differentiate the condition from other illnesses with similar presentations, such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) will be within normal limits in CIP and can become elevated in CIM. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis is the most frequent underlying factor in CIP (as opposed to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids, which predominate in CIM).Although not often performed, the gold standard for the diagnosis of critical illness neuropathy remains electrodiagnostic testing, which includes nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography. It should be noted that while EMG is the optimal way to make a diagnosis of CIP, there are many challenges to performing a complete study in ICU conditions, including electrical interference, anasarca, hypothermia, peripheral edema, or limited patient participation in the exam. Nevertheless, in the evaluation of profound weakness in the ICU setting, electrodiagnostic testing is an essential tool that can direct the clinical team in determining further management. Pathophysiology of CIP/CIM Etiology is not entirely clear, but it is though to be complex and multi-factorial in nature. Ultimately it lead to axonal dysfunction, ischemia, and degeneration necessitating aggressive treatment of underlying medical causes and physical neurorehabilitation. It is thought to be related to abnormal vascular, metabolic, and electrical processes leading to motor and/or sensory neuron abnormalities: Vascular autoregulation-leading to increase microvascular permeability (e.g. dilation of vessels) which can result in edema, hypoxemia, pro-inflammatory invasion of leukocytes and cytokines, and occlusion within the muscle-neuron units Metabolic-generation of reactive oxygen and nitric oxide species, failure of mitochondrial repair, neuronal hyperglycemic damage, and hypoalbuminemia Electrical-disruption of sodium and calcium channels and loss of cellular excitability Summary of clinical and histopathological features of CIP/CIM 1. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy Predisposing factors: sepsis with concurrent encephalopathy, recurrent exposure to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, and multi-organ failure Presence of diffuse paraparesis and/or paraplegia, more distal than proximal with preserved muscle bulk or mild atrophy Early loss of deep tendon reflexes or areflexia Long-standing difficulty weaning mechanical ventilation after exclusion of cardiopulmonary etiologies Electrodiagnostic evidence of axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy 2. Critical Illness Myopathy Predisposing factors: recurrent exposure to neuromuscular blocking agents, severe asthma, pneumonia, prolonged acidemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged high dose corticosteroid use, prolonged use of aminoglycosides, sepsis, multi-organ failure, and organ transplantation Presence of diffuse paraparesis and/or paraplegia, more proximal than distal with severe atrophy Delayed loss of deep tendon reflexes Long-standing difficulty weaning mechanical ventilation after exclusion of cardiopulmonary etiologies Electrodiagnostic evidence of motor unit and recruitment abnormalities as well as an absence of excitability with muscle stimulation, with possible preservation of sensory potentials Biopsy: Type II atrophic myofibers on H&E and myofiber necrosis",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Somnambulism is a parasomnia occurring in non-rapid eye movement sleep, and is characterized by ambulation as a disorder of arousal regulation. Sleep deprivation, alcohol abuse, fragmented sleep and certain medications can increase the risk of sleep walking. Report of case(s) Here we present a 35-year-old man with multiple triggers for sleep walking, resulting in recurrent parasomnia events over fifteen years. He had a history of bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic insomnia, moderate untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), anxiety with violent daytime behaviors, and prior alcohol abuse status post six years of sobriety. He was sent to our clinic due to increased frequency and severity of events, with nightly events for the last five years. Episodes were characterized by walking around the home, leaving the home, and driving on occasion. He reported at least one minor car accident as a result of sleep driving. He also reported an injury resulting from a fall in his home while sleep walking. Several security measures were implemented, including door gates, door alarms, and hiding car keys. His family slept in different bedrooms with locked doors for safety. The patient’s chronic insomnia improved with cognitive behavioral therapy, leading to an average sleep time of five hours per night with no reported hypersomnia or daytime fatigue. After his initial evaluation, he was referred for a mandibular advancement device for treatment of his OSA, due to prior poor compliance with positive airway pressure therapy related to his PTSD. Optimizing his OSA helped decrease arousals that might trigger sleep walking events. He also maintained close follow up with mental health for pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25 mg at bedtime was initiated given the severity of his somnambulism. Conclusion The use of a benzodiazepine can reduce slow wave sleep duration by its effect on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our patient had multiple risk factors for parasomnias, with severe, frequent episodes of sleepwalking leading to self-injury. His treatment involved both pharmacotherapy as well as optimization of underlying triggers. Support (if any):",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and senseless thoughts, images, or impulses that occur repeatedly. Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and involuntary by the patient and can focus on such themes as contamination, aggression, orderliness, religion, sex:, doubt, or loss of possessions. Compulsions are ritualistic but seemingly purposeful behaviors that are often performed in response to an obsession. These compulsive behaviors, either observable or mental, alleviate or neutralize anxiety associated with the obsession. The patient fears the outcome should he or she not perform the ritual, despite the knowledge that the fear is irrational. Because the ritual does not entirely relieve the fear, the impulse to repeat the ritual returns. Common compulsive behaviors include hand-washing, checking, arranging, touching, repeating, or hoarding. Table 1 summarizes diagnostic criteria according to the American Psychiatric Association. l Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs at some point during a lifetime in approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of the population; it is equally common in men as in women, and one-third of the cases begin by the age of 15 years.2 As with many other psychiatric illnesses, patients might not seek care until years after the onset of the disease. A variety of causes have been proposed: behavioral, developmental, biochemical, psychological, and genetic. Familial tendencies have been seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one sample of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 71 percent had a parent with either full-blown obsessive-compulsive disotder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.3 The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder have also previously been viewed as extreme variants of normal developmental rituals",

Among the most important coping mechanisms are communication, maintenance of military social structure, and personality flexibility. Following repatriation some former POWs develop psychiatric disorders, most commonly 1) medico-psychiatric disorders due to illness, physical trauma, or nutritional deficit, 2) post-traumatic stress disorder, 3) adjustment disorder, 4) depression, 5) anxiety disorders, 6) substance use disorders, and 7) family problems. The severity of captivity and the presence or absence of social supports during and after the POW experience play major roles in the recovery or illness that may occur after repatriation.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the key underpinnings of human health, yet sleep disturbances and impaired sleep are rampant in modern life. Healthy sleep is a whole-body process impacted by circadian rhythm, daily activities, and emotional well-being, among others. When properly aligned, these work in concert to produce restorative and refreshing sleep. When not in balance, however, sleep disorders result. Yet too often, the approach to treatment of sleep disorders is compartmentalized, failing to recognize all of the complex interactions that are involved. This text offers a comprehensive approach to sleep and sleep disorders by delineating the many factors that interplay into healthy sleep. Health care providers can learn how to better manage their patients with sleep disorders by integrating complementary and conventional approaches. Using an evidence-based approach throughout, this book describes the basics of normal sleep then delves into the foundations of integrative sleep medicine, including the circadian rhythm, mind/body-sleep connection, light, dreaming, the gastrointestinal system, and botanicals/supplements. Specific sleep issues and disorders are then addressed from an integrative perspective, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, sleep related movement disorders, and parasomnias.",

      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

      "abstract": "La chronobiologie a pour objet l'étude des rythmes biologiques, dont ceux de la vigilance et des performances. En neurophysiologie, la vigilance est définie par des niveaux d'activation du système nerveux soumis à des variations de type circadien, ultradien et circasémidien au cours du nycthémère. L'analyse du rythme de la vigilance chez l'homme montre que les épisodes d'hypovigilance apparaissent à des horaires prévisibles de la journée. L'erreur humaine liée à une baisse de la vigilance au volant est une des principales causes des accidents routiers. Ces derniers présentent un rythme de périodicité de 24 h avec des pics et des creux à des heures déterminées. Le maximum de risque coïncide avec les horaires du pic minimum de la vigilance, en milieu d'après-midi, tard la nuit et tôt le matin. Ces horaires sont compatibles avec le profil circadien de la somnolence. Les principales causes favorisant ces accidents sont les troubles du sommeil, l'ingestion d'alcool et la prise de médicaments psychotropes. La prise en compte des données chronobiologiques peut améliorer la sécurité en proposant des solutions d'adaptation des horaires de travail aux variations circadiennes des capacités fonctionnelles de l'opérateur humain. La détermination des horaires de meilleure performance de l'opérateur humain et leur concordance avec ses horaires de travail permet d'améliorer sa fiabilité et de réduire ainsi le risque d'accident. Cet article présente dans un premier temps une étude bibliographique sur les concepts relatifs à la chronobiologie de la vigilance et des performances, en soulignant l'apport et les limites des mesures préconisées pour détecter et prévenir l'hypovigilance du conducteur. Il propose ensuite une démarche méthodologique d'application de la chronobiologie de la vigilance au domaine de la sécurité du transport routier, qui s'articule autour de sept grandes étapes complémentaires. Chronobiology is the study of biological rhythms, including those of alertness and performance. Neurophysiologists define alertness in terms of levels of activation of the nervous system which is subject to circadian, ultradian and circasemidian variations during the nycthemeron. Study of the rhythm of human alertness has shown that episodes of low alertness occur at foreseeable times of the day. Human error caused by reduced alertness while driving is one of the main causes of road traffic accidents, which exhibit a rhythm with a periodicity of 24 hours with peaks and troughs at fixed times. The highest risks coincide with the lowest levels of alertness, and these occur in the mid-afternoon, late at night, and early in the morning. These times of day are compatible with the circadian pattern of sleepiness. The main factors that increase the likelihood of accidents are sleep disturbances, alcohol ingestion and the taking of psychotropic drugs. Chronobiological data can be used to improve safety if it provides solutions that adapt working hours to circadian variations and the functional capacities of the human operator. Determining the times when human operator performance is at its best and making working hours compatible with them provides a means of improving the human operator's reliability and therefore reduces accident risk. This paper begins with a literature survey concerning the concepts of the chronobiology of alertness and performance, and stresses the potential and limits of the recommended measures for detecting and preventing low driver alertness. It then proposes a methodological approach for applying the chronobiology of alertness in the area of road transport safety, which is based seven complementary stages.",

Nevertheless, when fear is intense and maladaptive, it may lose its role for survival and may progress in a phobic disorder with a negative impact for the individual who suffers it. According to some researchers, childhood and adolescence are the main life periods where phobias and other anxiety disorders develop. It is estimated that up to 50% of children and adolescents report one or more intense fears and more than 20% of these meet diagnostic criteria for specific phobias, frequently related to the development of future mental disorders during adulthood.",

Polysomnogram revealed severe OSA; initiation of CPAP and levothyroxine resulted in immediate improvement. The lack of a previous psychiatric history and acuteness of presentation was consistent with hypothyroid psychosis complicated by sleep deprivation cause by untreated OSA. Primary hypothyroidism is a common disorder often associated with depression. It is rarely associated with psychosis and was first described as \"myxoedematous madness\" in 1949. It has not been previously reported to cause psychosis when associated with obstructive sleep apnea. This case illustrates the need for examination of potential multiple organic causes in a patient who presents with psychosis in the critical care setting.",

The clinical manifestations are many and various, and are symptomatic of either a rapid, or of a slow and insidious disintegration of the intellectual, moral, and affective life. Of all the prodromata, failure and decay of the moral sense are the most important, and are exemplified by acts of omission and commission against law, order, and propriety. The disease attacks all classes, and as the friends cannot nicely discriminate the changes in character, and are apt to look upon them as temporary aberrations, the disturbance to the social fabric caused by these sporadic displays of moral perversion is not inconsiderable. The nature and extent of the disharmony and distress occasioned by these moral lapses depend largely on the social standing, occupation, and opportunities of the diseased individual, and desolate homes, widespread ruin, and unenviable publicity often follow in the train of the predominant imaginative conceptions. The larger ambition may lead to wild speculation, the bolder schemes to fraud. Sobriety is turned into drunkenness, and sexual excitement may result in rape and acts of indecency. If thwarted or opposed, destructiveness or violence may ensue, but in this direction serious consequences are comparatively seldom associated with the expansive prodromata. The budding paralytic of this type is rarely vindictive; although easily roused to anger, he is easily calmed. Being, in his own estimation, so superior mentally and physically to his fellow-men, he can afford to pity and forgive.",

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

Understanding the physiology and pattern of normal sleep is an important foundation for interpreting the clinical symptoms, signs, and neurophysiological abnormalities observed in patients with sleep disorders. The term polysomnography refers to the simultaneous recording of multiple sleep parameters, including a limited electroencephalogram, respiratory parameters, chest excursion, limb movements, and the electrocardiogram. Polysomnography is important for assessing a variety of sleep disturbances, including disorders such as sleep-related breathing disorders (including obstructive sleep apnea), rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and periodic movements of sleep.

      "abstract": "Most of the physiological functions of the body, including hormone secretion, differ during sleep and wakefulness. Circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep pressure are the determining factors in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Fluctuations in hormone levels are largely determined by circadian rhythms. The central biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is synchronized with external signals, and largely determines the daily rhythms of hormone secretion. Many hormones can affect respiratory function during sleep, exacerbating sleep apnea when their secretion is excessive or deficient. Sleep disorders can occur in a number of neuroendocrine diseases, worsening the quality of life of patients and, in some cases, contributing to the development of life-threatening complications. Screening for sleep disorders, in particular the active detection of sleep apnea in acromegaly, hypothyroidism and hypercorticism, can significantly reduce the risk of complications with timely treatment.",

Some of the issues that place people at a higher risk for developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) include: longer duration of the traumatic event; higher number of traumatic events; higher severity of the traumatic event, having little social support from family and friends. Also, children and adolescents, females, people with learning disabilities, or people who experience violence in the home seem to have a greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. The websites of psychiatry organizations describe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as ranging from sleeplessness, nightmares to grief and depression – with accompanying physical signs such as headaches and irregular heartbeats. Such symptoms may gradually subside after a while; including chronic irritability, feelings of constantly being under threat, overeating, and alcohol abuse, perhaps dependency on tranquillizers or painkillers.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Sleep disorders during the prodromal synucleinopathy period, primarily isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and daytime hypersomnolence correlate best with the recently proposed “body-first” Lewy body disease progression. iRBD is the most widely recognized form of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, and patients with iRBD show abnormal α-synuclein in tissues and biofluids even in the absence of cognitive or motor symptoms. More importantly, individuals with iRBD have an elevated risk for near-term development of a clinically diagnosable symptomatic synucleinopathy. Other sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and circadian rhythm dysfunction also occur across the synucleinopathy spectrum, although their prognostic significance is less well understood than iRBD. Finally, isolated REM sleep without atonia may represent an even earlier stage of prodromal synucleinopathy, but further studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "The diagnostic criteria and treatment of insomnia are reviewed.Insomnia is most often described as a subjective complaint of poor sleep quality or quantity despite adequate time for sleep, resulting in daytime fatigue, irritability, and decreased concentration. Insomnia is classified as idiopathic or comorbid. Comorbid insomnias are associated with psychiatric disorders, medical disorders, substance abuse, and specific sleep disorders. Idiopathic insomnia is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. A wide array of terminology exists for defining the duration of insomnia symptoms, which may add to the confusion regarding insomnia classification. Acute insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting from one night to a few weeks, whereas chronic insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting at least three nights weekly for at least one month. Diagnostic tools for identifying insomnia are multifactorial. Nonpharmacologic interventions for insomnia include sleep-hygiene education, stimulus-control therapy, relaxation therapy, and sleep-restriction therapy. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Choice of a specific agent should be based on patient-specific factors, including age, proposed length of treatment, primary sleep complaint, history of drug or alcohol abuse, and cost.Many treatment options are available for patients with insomnia. Behavioral therapies should be initiated as first-line treatment in most patients. For patients who require the addition of pharmacologic therapy, the drugs with the most evidence for benefit include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Selection of a specific agent must take into account numerous patient-specific factors.",

Social and cultural biases influence the occurrence of napping behavior. However, several observations indicate the presence in man of a two per day modulation of sleep propensity. On the other hand, alterations of nocturnal sleep have been widely described in affective disorders, but little is known about the presence of daytime sleep in depressed patients and the possible effect of daytime sleep episodes on nocturnal sleep. Some attempts to characterize daytime sleep in depression are reviewed. A recent study based on continuous polygraphic recordings indicate that napping occurrence appears to be similar in depressed patients than in control subjects. However, naps structure and organization were different in depressed patients in comparison to controls. Napping seems thus to be more prevalent in depressed patients than previously assumed. Possible effects of naps on mood, alertness in depressed patients remains to be explored.",

Some individuals have severe symptoms that cause repeated and prolonged awakenings. Others are aware of only mild symptoms at bedtime that prolong falling asleep. Patients may complain of insomnia, especially difficulty with sleep onset and repeated nighttime awakenings. Most characteristic of restless legs syndrome are reports of sensations deep in the muscles. This disorder may begin at any age, including during childhood. Restless legs syndrome is strongly associated with iron deficiency.

      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

Disturbed sleep can be found in 30-80% of patients, depending on the degree of psychotic symptomatology. Difficulty falling asleep, maintaining, or achieving restful sleep is associated with symptom severity and has been reported as a prodromal symptom of psychotic relapse. Although some sleep disorders improve with antipsychotic treatment, in many cases, even during disease remission, sleep continues to be fragmented, or even different pathophysiological mechanism is causing sleep disruption. Moreover, it may be complicated if the patient needs specific treatment, such as positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, due to sleep-disordered breathing. The article presents case reports of patients with schizophrenia with sleep disturbances. As presented in our case reports, cognitive behavioral therapy seems effective in treating comorbid insomnia, even in patients with schizophrenia. The second and third case reports emphasise the need for broader clinical considerations, a cross-diagnostic approach, and cooperation in care for patients with severe mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "abstract": "Muscle Tension Dysphonia-The Untold StoryHuman voice production involves coordinated functioning of the vocal folds and regulated airflow from the lungs to the oropharynx.A synchronized activity of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory and articulatory systems lead to the optimal phonatory outcome.Smaller intrinsic muscles and larger extrinsic muscles need to work in harmony, to produce voice, which is appropriate to age, sex, and society.The excessive tension of the laryngeal or extralaryngeal muscles or both result in suboptimal phonatory function.Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a condition characterized by varying degree of dysphonia and other associated symptoms, primarily due to tension and uncoordinated activity of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the larynx.This is generally subdivided into primary and secondary type.In primary MTD, there is no structural or neurological abnormality associated with muscle tension.The secondary type usually occurs as a compensatory mechanism for underlying glottic insufficiency or mucosal lesion.On the other hand, long-term untreated MTD may itself turn out to be a precursor of phonotraumatic mucosal lesion.Earlier, these patients with vocal dysfunction with no apparent structural lesion or neurological dysfunction were stamped under the category of functional voice disorders.Subsequently, extensive work by many authors has led to the understanding of this complex condition.Evolution of classification has also resulted in the addition of a plethora of terminologies to the literature namely hyperfunctional dysphonia, muscle misuse voice disorder, musculoskeletal tension dysphonia, hyperkinetic dysphonia, laryngeal isometric disorder, laryngeal tension fatigue syndrome and many more.Finally, \"muscle tension dysphonia\" has emerged to be the universally accepted nomenclature.Multifactorial etiology of this condition is well established.Anxiety and stress, coupled with vocal abuse and misuse are the major causative factors; personality plays an important role.Besides, compensatory maladaptation for any structural lesion can lead to secondary MTD.An MTD, either primary or secondary is one of the most commonly encountered diagnoses in any voice clinic.Patients may present with a mild degree of hoarseness to extremely strained voice, along with odynophonia.A careful history of vocal demand and usage along with any history of underlying stress often provides diagnostic clue.External neck inspection is of paramount importance to detect the position of larynx and muscle tension during phonation.Palpation of suprahyoid, thyrohyoid and cricothyroid space usually elicits tenderness of specific muscles, even at rest.The endolaryngeal examination should ideally be done with a flexible nasolaryngoscope, to detect supraglottic muscle tension during the larynx in action.Stroboscopy helps identify any associated mucosal lesion leading to MTD.Intrinsic muscle tension at the supraglottic or glottic level is usually graded on the basis of various classifications.Management involves voice therapy which may be indirect or direct.Indirect therapy involves educating patients about healthy phonatory habits and training corrective vocal exercises to release tension.Direct therapy is aimed at releasing musculoskeletal tension to promote healthy phonatory posture.Circumlaryngeal therapy, stretch and flow phonation, vocal function exercises and resonant voice therapy are the common techniques used.Medical treatment of associated problems like laryngopharyngeal reflux and surgical treatment of any structural lesion should be undertaken.Role of EMG-guided botulinum toxin injection is also emerging in recent years.Diagnosis of MTD is simple and straightforward, provided the clinician is aware of this condition.However, there is a need for more comprehensive grading system encompassing both external and endolaryngeal findings.This would help in delivering more tailor-made direct voice therapy to correct tension of specific muscles.Use of botulinum toxin injection is also likely to increase, especially for cases refractory to voice therapy.",

OSAS involves the existence of at least 5 breathing breaks of at least 10 seconds in a sleeping hour. OSAS etiologic factors are numerous, the most important being the increased body weight of patients (a high percentage of 50% of patients with OSAS with different degrees of obesity), age (OSAS is diagnosed in middle-aged people), craniofacial deformities, multiple pathologies leading to narrowing of the upper airways, gender (is more common in men), genetic causes (more common in black and Hispanic people), alcohol, tobacco, hypnotic and sedative medications. Symptoms of OSAS are characterized by daytime and night-time symptoms. Of the daytime symptoms, patients frequently report headache and morning fatigue, daytime somnolence, memory impairment and concentration. Of the nocturnal symptoms, the most common symptoms experienced by patients are snoring and repeated episodes of apnea. Patients also report nocturia, polakiuria, decreased libido, symptoms that are often attributed to other pathologies. Due to concentration disturbances and low cognitive performance among patients with OSAS, they will experience a decrease in work capacity, which is reflected by the loss of work, reflected by the decrease in the number of working days. OSAS treatment is complex, different depending on the severity of the disease and the existing comorbidities of the patient.",

Sleep cycles and their given durations have been clinically proven to influence essential aspects of human life: cardiovascular health, metabolic health, mental health, immunologic health, human performance, and mortality, to name a few [1]. Inadequate sleep has known associations with increased risks of mortality, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and depression. Rest, in the context of this chapter, is not necessarily synonymous with sleep – for instance, sleep can still occur without rest and its improvements on overall functioning [2]. Relaxation often corresponds to feelings of peace, comfort, body laxity, mental laxity, and positive emotions. Relaxation as a wellness tool can take a variety of forms, such as abdominal breathing and progressive muscle relaxation techniques [3].",

      "title": "Gangguan Insomnia pada Mahasiswa Yang Menyusun Skripsi (Studi Kasus pada Mahasiswa Jurusan Psikologi Universitas Negeri Semarang",
      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan bagian hidup manusia yang memiliki porsi banyak,\r\nrata-rata hampir seperempat hingga sepertiga waktu digunakan untuk tidur. Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

      "title": "Anxiety Disorders in Late Life",
      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent and understudied mental health problems in late life. Specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder are the most prevalent anxiety disorders in older adults among the 11 disorders identified by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (fifth edition). Anxiety disorders lead to significant functional burdens and interface with physical health problems and cognitive impairment, concerns frequently experienced in adults over age 65. Additional contextual factors should be considered when assessing and treating late-life anxiety, including the effects of polypharmacy, other mental health conditions, role changes, and societal attitudes toward aging. The relationship between anxiety and physical health problems in older adults can be causal or contextual, and can involve poorer estimates of subjective health and lower ratings of functioning. These factors present unique challenges to the detection, conceptualization, and treatment of late-life anxiety, including the tendency for older adults to focus on somatic symptoms and the potential for long-term behaviors that can mask distress such as substance use. Researchers are increasingly incorporating a gerodiversity framework to understand the contributions of cultural, individual, and other group differences that may affect the presentation of anxiety symptoms and disorders. Older adults in general are less likely to be treated for anxiety disorders, and intersecting individual and group differences likely further affect how anxiety disorders are perceived by healthcare providers. Cognitive behavioral therapy and its variants have the most empirical support for treatment. Newer evidence lends support to acceptance and commitment therapy and problem-solving therapy, which tend to address some of the contextual factors that may be important in treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are genetic respiratory diseases featured by chronic upper and lower airway inflammation and infection, mainly due to impaired mucociliary clearance due to genetic mutations. Sleep is crucial to healthy children’s normal physical and psychological development and has an important value in chronic respiratory diseases. Impaired sleep quality, such as sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep during the night, and sleep respiratory disorders (SRDs) are common in 5% to 30% of the general population. Sleep disruption leads to attention deficits, daytime sleepiness, fatigue and mood disorders and correlates to a worsened quality of life. Furthermore, sleep respiratory disorders (SRSs) are under-recognized comorbidities in CF and PCD patients. SRSs include a spectrum of symptoms ranging from primary snoring through upper airway resistance to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nocturnal hypoventilation and hypoxemia occurring in people with moderate to severe lung disease and damaging the disease-related outcomes and quality of life. Effective screening during sleep with polysomnography is very important for the timely initiation of efficacious treatments and to prevent worsened respiratory, metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes. However, the impact of SRDs on health and quality of life is still underinvestigated.",

      "abstract": "Hearing impairment is so often an invisible disability that it does not often enter the awareness of those whose senses are intact. A textbook knowledge of the physiology and pathology of hearing does not prepare the clinician to cope with a hearing-impaired family member, friend, or colleague, with whom we feel embarrassed, lest our raised voices attract too much attention. We are even less prepared to evaluate or treat hearing-impaired persons in the course of our professional activities. Yet hearing impairment is common, and the profoundly deaf probably suffer mental disorders at a rate in excess of that of their hearing peers. Profound deafness, the absence of functional or remediable hearing, is extremely disabling. Profound deafness that occurs prior to complete acquisition of verbal language is socially and psychiatrically devastating. , · Such deafness, also known as prelingual deafness, is believed to result in uneven, incomplete, or arrested personality developmentl· 4 and behavioral disturbances, S the understanding of which is complicated by the natural language barrier. Prelingually deaf offenders are said to have special problems within the criminal justice system,6-9 analogous in some respects to the diagnostic difficulties known to accompany such deafness. ' '2 At least since the late nineteenth century, commentators have questioned whether hearing impairment is associated with criminality. The legal status of the defendant has been coupled with that of the mentally disordered for centuries. Observations on these issues are scattered throughout the writings of disparate disciplines, and we are unaware of efforts to systematize the inconclusive and sometimes conflicting findings. In this article, we touch upon the historical legal status of the deaf-mute defendant, present data on a study of deaf defendants admitted to a maximum security psychiatric facility, and review studies exploring possible relationships between hearing impairment and adult criminality and between hearing impairment and juvenile delinquency.

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction often accompanies severe psychiatric illness and can be due to both the mental disorder itself and the use of psychotropic treatments. Many sexual symptoms resolve as the mental state improves, but treatment-related sexual adverse events tend to persist over time, and are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction adversely affects quality of life and may contribute to reduce treatment adherence. There are important differences between the various compounds in the incidence of adverse sexual effects, associated with differences in mechanisms of action. Antidepressants with a predominantly serotonergic activity, antipsychotics likely to induce hyperprolactinaemia, and mood stabilizers with hormonal effects are often linked to moderate or severe sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, delayed orgasm, anorgasmia, and sexual arousal difficulties. Severe mental disorders can interfere with sexual function and satisfaction, while patients wish to preserve a previously satisfactory sexual activity. In many patients, a lack of intimate relationships and chronic deterioration in mental and physical health can be accompanied by either a poor sexual life or a more frequent risky sexual behaviour than in the general population. Here we describe the influence of psychosis and antipsychotic medications, of depression and antidepressant drugs, and of bipolar disorder and mood stabilizers on sexual health, and the optimal management of patients with severe psychiatric illness and sexual dysfunction.",

Results indicate a significant increase in sleep fragmentation, as expressed by decreased sleep efficiency, total sleep time, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and an increased wake after sleep onset latency, total time awake, latency to SWS, number of awakenings and number of awakenings from REM sleep. The results demonstrate that negative emotion correlates with enhanced sleep fragmentation helping us to understand why sleep patterns change and how sleep disturbances may develop.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In a general sense, the operational definition of insomnia in children may be construed as similar to that in adults, i.e., significant difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep and/or non-restorative sleep (early morning awakening is an infrequent complaint in children). However, practically speaking, the most frequent clinical manifestations of childhood insomnia, particularly in younger children, are bedtime refusal or resistance, delayed sleep onset, and/or prolonged night wakings requiring parental intervention. It is estimated that overall 20% to 30% of children in cross-sectional studies are reported to have some significant bedtime problems and/or night wakings (1-7), and a recent study suggests that lifetime prevalence of insomnia in 13 to 16-year-old adolescents approaches 11% (8). These percentages are substantially higher in children with psychiatric comorbidities (9,10) and with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (11). Furthermore, there is clear evidence from both experimental laboratory-based studies and clinical observations that insufficient and poor quality sleep in children results in or exacerbates mood instability and behavioral dysregulation, impacts negatively on neurocognitive functions and academic performance (12-14), and affects caregivers, with significant repercussions on family functioning. Therefore, appropriate and effective management of insomnia in the pediatric population is an important therapeutic goal for mental healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Paradoxical sleep is a sleep stage characterized physiologically by a lack of muscle tone; rapid eye movements (REMs), which are not always rapid; and an awake cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern. The paradox refers to the disparity between the alert EEG pattern, implying that the person is awake or nearly so, and the indications that the person is actually more deeply asleep than at other times (difficulty in arousing, reduced muscle tone). The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern. REM without atonia or REM behavior disorder is a sleep disorder in which the atonia fails to occur, with the result that the sleeper may actually perform his or her REM sleep actions.",

Zolpidem is among the most commonly prescribed medications for insomnia in Korea. However, parasomnia has sometimes been reported to occur post its usage. Here, we present two cases of patients taking zolpidem for insomnia who experienced dangerous events while asleep that they did not recall upon waking. The nature of these events was so perilous that they posed a threat to the patients’ lives. While one patient sustained a bodily injury, the other was at risk of a potentially fatal injury.

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness. Insomnia is often divided into subtypes based on the prevailing symptom. Insomnia is a risk factor for developing other somatic and mental disorders such as cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, depression, and causes increased healthcare costs. Given the bidirectional association of insomnia with the development of other somatic and mental diseases, the term “comorbid insomnia” may be used. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioural, and physiological factors. The goals of insomnia treatment are to improve quantitative and qualitative aspects of sleep, to reduce the distress and anxiety associated with poor sleep, and to improve daytime function. Efficacious treatments for insomnia include behavioural, cognitive, and pharmacological interventions. Simple behavioural interventions may be provided in primary care facilities, but lack of training in these techniques limits their use. Among pharmacological interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although on-going concerns focus on their safety as compared to modest efficacy. Different “natural” and OTC drugs are used as sleeping medications, for instance melatonin-based drugs. Behavioural treatments should be used whenever possible, and drugs should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.",

      "abstract": "Common Mental Disorders such as depression in late life are not well understood or acknowledged either by the community or the medical profession in India for three important reasons. First, recognition of common mental disorders as a psychiatric problem in general is relatively poor. Secondly, the relative proportion of elders is less than 5% for most Indian communities; this demographic situation is bound to change in the future with predictions that the oldest sector of the population will exceed 100 million over the next 20 years. The third reason is the fatalistic attitude toward aging in India, which mandates that elderly persons accept their physical and mental condition as a normal part of old age. The common presenting complaints of depression are somatic; on inquiry, however, most depressed elders will admit to cognitive and emotional symptoms typical of depression. The hallmark cognitive feature is anhedonia. Co-morbidity with physical ill-health is common. Risk factors for depression include low education, poverty, social isolation and family discord. The latter is on the rise as a result of the breakdown of traditional community structures because of the massive migration of younger productive members of families to urban areas and reduced economic activity in rural areas. The commonest treatments in primary care are symptomatic. Research into the treatments for depression, integrating the subject of depression into training programs for community and general health workers and collaborating with Non-Governmental Organisations are key factors in meeting mental health needs of elders.",

Acute and chronic pain differ from each other clearly. Acute pain warns about danger that is threatening the human body. This starts us to evaluate the situation and to act upon the danger. Behind an acute pain is always some somatic disturbance or disease. Acute pain causes also many changes in the autonomic nervous system; blood pressure, muscle tension and heart rate raise when the body is in the alarm position. Chronic pain doesn't warn the body about threatening danger because clear pathology doesn't always exist. Chronic pain reduces human life. It causes zest for life, tiring and reluctance. The chronic pain brings also following symptoms: sleeping disturbances, depression, social isolation, unemployment and loss of control of life.",

Approximately 25% of all children develop sleep problems ranging from difficulty falling asleep and night awakenings to more serious sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. The complications related to sleep disorder include cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive conditions as well as failure to thrive and growth retardation. Children also developed social and academic growth retardation. This chapter describes how to recognize, evaluate, and treat sleep disorders in children. This chapter also addresses sleep problems and special populations including pregnancy and menopausal states. Maternal sleep quality in the perinatal period begins to change; it has been noted that the greatest sleep disruption tends to occur approximately 1 week postpartum. Approximately 50% of women experience excessive daytime sleepiness at 18 weeks postpartum. Postpartum major depression is a serious illness that occurs in approximately 13% of mothers, negatively affecting both the mother's and child's psychological adjustment. Poor sleep clearly is a major confounder in maternal depression. Menopause is a time of change of life for women. By definition, menopause is considered when there has been the absence of menstrual periods for 1 year. Hormonal changes begin 7–10 years before the final menses. During this perimenopausal period, the pituitary-gonadal axis changes with decreasing estradiol and progesterone and rising FSH and LH.",

Intimately related to physical activity, chronic breathlessness reduces the ability to carry out activities of daily living [4] and restricts the role in the family, workplace or wider society [5]. These consequences, with additional frightening severe episodes of breathless crises, lead not only to acute emotional responses that not only widely activate a multitude of brain regions [6], but also promote the insidious development of depression, anxiety and panic, and a reduction in physical and mental quality of life proportionate with the severity of breathlessness [7].

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

      "title": "Temporal organization as a therapeutic target",
      "abstract": "Biological functions occur at many different frequencies, and each has its healthy and pathological ranges, patterns, and properties. Physiology, biochemistry, and behavior are not only organized at the morphological level in cells and organs, but separated or coordinated in time for minimal interference and optimal function. One of the most important temporal frameworks is that of the 24-hour day-night cycle, and its change in day length with season. Robust circadian rhythms are important for mental and physical well-being. Though rhythms have been long neglected as irrelevant (in spite of the high prevalence of sleep disorders in nearly every psychiatric illness), we now have tools to document rhythm disruption and, through better understanding of underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms, to develop therapeutic applications. Light as the major synchronizing agent of the biological clock is becoming a treatment option not only for winter depression but other, nonseasonal forms, as well as an adjunct in optimizing sleep-wake cycles, daytime alertness, cognition, and mood in many neuropsychiatric illnesses. Melatonin is the signal of darkness and promotes sleep onset. Manipulation of sleep (wake therapy, phase advance) has yielded the most rapid, nonpharmacological antidepressant effect known, and combinations (with light, medication) provide long-lasting response. Thus, by analogy, new molecules to augment synchronization or mimic changes occuring during night-time wakefulness may yield novel treatments. This issue on biological rhythms contains articles on a variety of different frequencies not included in the usual definition of chronobiology, but which open up interesting approaches to time and illness.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background and aims</h3> Sleep disorders, like difficulties falling asleep or maintaining sleep, are very common in children. Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

      "abstract": "FIFTEEN to 20 million Americans suffer chronically from the tyranny of insomnia. Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to newborns, who spend 16–20 h in sleep each day, adults need only about sleep daily. However, many elderly may struggle to obtain those 8 h in one block. In addition to changes in sleep duration, sleep patterns change as age progresses. Like the physical changes that occur during old age, an alteration in sleep pattern is also a part of the normal ageing process. As people age, they tend to have a harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep. Older people spend more time in the lighter stages of sleep than in deep sleep. As the circadian mechanism in older people becomes less efficient, their sleep schedule is shifted forward. Even when they manage to obtain 7 or 8 h sleep, they wake up early, as they have gone to sleep quite early. The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher among older adults. Loud snoring, which is more common in the elderly, can be a symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea, which puts a person at risk for cardiovascular diseases, headaches, memory loss, and depression. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder that disrupt sleep are more prevalent in older persons. Other common medical problems of old age such as hypertension diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases such as asthma, immune disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, physical disability, dementia, pain, depression, and anxiety are all associated with sleep disturbances.",

Beyond the social and professional impairment and the increased risk of traffic and work accidents, these patients are exposed to the complications of systemic hypertension, which is often associated, and of less frequent cardiorespiratory failure. The diagnosis is based upon polysomnography which demonstrates the ventilation abnormalities.

      "title": "Rest: Its Use and Abuse in the Aged†",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rest is essential, even though its exact physiologic functions and quantitative requirements are far from clear. Sleep appears to be the primary and most imperative form of rest. The nature, the role, and the necessity for rest as simple relaxation and leisure are elusive and poorly defined. The rejuvenating effects of leisure and diversion are apparent, over and above the pleasure and enjoyment they bring to life. Absolute rest has in the past been an important component of therapy for disease and injury. Relatively recent evidence that bed rest may prolong invalidism and contribute to complications, combined with the development of more specific therapies, has reduced both the necessity and prescription for bed rest. However, it should be emphasized that the data are incomplete, and in some situations such as myocardial disease or hepatitis, there is no final proof that early activity does not have late effects. This article presents a perspective and a classification that can serve as a more precise and restrictive context in which the concept of rest can be used and prescribed. Further study is necessary to establish whether rest which is not sleep, not diversion, nor a discredited prescription of immobility, is physiologically or psychologically valid, and to determine a more precise measure of required “dosage.”",

Delta or slow wave sleep is characterized by high voltage, slow waves. The increasing presence of large delta waves indicates the onset of delta sleep. Waking the sleeper is most difficult at this time; hence, delta sleep is considered the deepest stage of sleep. The physiology of the body during rapid eye movement (REM) is quite different from that during non- REM (NREM). The stages of sleep in the average young adult show a fairly regular cyclic alteration. Environmental influences such as daylight, traffic noises, and the activity of other people tend to make prolonged sleep more difficult. The relationship between length of prior wakefulness and the amount of delta that follows is direct.",

Psychosis is a disorder which shows the effect for long-term or sometimes for the short term on an individual. In this review we will mainly look for natural psychosis inducers like Salvia divinorum and this plant may produce some secondary metabolites. Still, many of these are found to show an effect on human health in some or the other way which may range from hallucination to organ failure. These secondary metabolites affect the hippocampus region of the human brain, which is linked with memory.

Muscle dysmorphia is a specifier (subtype) of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) characterized by pathologic preoccupation with muscularity and fear or anxiety about not being big or muscular enough, despite having an objectively normal or muscular body—or even a very muscular build. It is most often seen in males; average age at onset is before the end of the second decade. This preoccupation with body image often compromises social and occupational functioning, in part because of compulsive and meticulous exercise and dietary regimens. Individuals may avoid bodily exposure because of shame associated with perceived small body build. There is significant comorbid medical, social, and psychological disease burden, including disordered eating, other forms of BDD, anxiety, and substance use disorders (often steroid abuse). Treatment is challenging, as many patients do not present to a clinician.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The cardiorespiratory control system undergoes functional maturation after birth. Until this process is completed, the cardiorespiratory system is unstable, placing infants at risk for cardiorespiratory disturbances, especially during sleep. The profound influence of states of alertness on respiratory and cardiac control has been the focus of intense scrutiny during the last decade. The effects of rapid‐eye movement (REM) sleep on various mechanisms involved in cardiorespiratory control are of particular significance during the postnatal period since newborns spend much of their time in this sleep state. In fullterm newborns, REM sleep occupies more than 50% of total sleep time, and this percentage is even greater in preterm newborns. From term to six months of age, the proportion of REM sleep decreases. 2 Since respiratory and cardiac disturbances are known to occur selectively during REM sleep, the predominance of REM sleep may be a risk factor for abnormal sleep‐related events during early infancy. 3 Awareness of these developmental changes in sleep patterns is important for clinicians dealing with problems such as apparent life‐threatening events (ALTE), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and/or cardiorespiratory responses to respiratory disorders. Our current understanding of respiratory and cardiac control rests mainly on studies conducted during the first months of life. There is a paucity of data on late infancy and early childhood. The present paper will review available data on how sleep affects 1) ventilatory mechanics, in particular of the upper airways and the chest wall; ventilation and apnea; gas exchange; chemoreceptor function; and arousal responses; 2) changes in heart rate and heart rate variability, and the occurrence and mechanisms of bradycardia. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Today psychiatric researchers are trying to identify the precise role of molecular clock in mood regulation and learn how specific types of rhythm disruptions lead to and/or exacerbate mood-related phenotypes.

Panic disorders or panic attacks are intense and usually brief episodes that have often come upon the sufferer as an extreme dread and fear of annihilation. Panic attacks are startling and often produce a sense of impending doom and fear of imminent disaster. They are associated with heart palpitations, dizziness, tingling of extremities, disorientation, and the urge to flee the present environment. During a panic attack, it is not unusual for the sufferer to act in ways that seem completely irrational and beyond the realm of sanity. Imagine sitting quietly in a darkened room and being intensely engrossed in a book that you cannot put down. Suddenly you feel someone's hands grasp your neck and begin choking you. That level of startled and life-threatening fear is like what many report during a panic attack. It is difficult to know what causes this disorder. In many cases, sufferers report having endured traumatic experiences, especially in childhood. However, in an equal percentage of cases, there is no prior trauma history, and the origins of the panic disorder are unknown, although they do tend to run in families. This book elucidates the nature of panic, the factors that contribute to the disorder, and describes psychological, physiological, and medical interventions that have been useful in ameliorating the suffering brought on by panic attacks.",

      "title": "Crises and Life Changes preceding the Onset or Relapse of Acute Schizophrenia: Clinical Aspects",
      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

      "title": "Nasal dilator for management of sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Sleep disorders are commonly caused by nasal obstruction. Fatigue, when present in those with nasal problems and otherwise unexplained, is often considered secondary to poor or inadequate sleep.‘,’ Nasal obstruction itself is associated with many systemic reflexes, including changes in intrathoracic pressure, pulse, and blood pressure.3 Reports during the 19th century proposed a nasal reflex rather than sleep disturbance as the origin of fatigue in many patients with nasal obstruction. The following case describes fatigue associated with nasal obstruction promptly relieved by a nasal dilator and therefore unrelated to sleep abnormalities. The patient was a 4%year-old man with a lo-year history of unexplained persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest. The fatigue was especially pronounced on awakening but continued throughout the day. It was not associated with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, headache, or known sleep disturbance. Aside from fatigue, symptoms were limited to nasal congestion especially on the left side and a “heavy-headedness” sensation in the head. Four comprehensive examinations over the 10 symptomatic years were without relevant findings. Symptoms of nasal congestion and a cyst in the left maxillary sinus noted on a sinus roentgenogram prompted the following procedures: creation of antral windows, removal of the maxillary cyst, nasal septum reconstruction, and partial resection of the inferior turbinates; all with no effect on the fatigue. Approximately 8 years after the onset of fatigue, the patient noted that relief could be obtained by pressing up the left external nares. This observation suggested dysfunction of the nasal valve and prompted reconstruction using cartilage grafts, a procedure that was unsuccessful in relieving his inadequate air flow or his fatigue. At the suggestion of a consultant he purchased a nasal dilator for the left anterior nares and obtained almost immediate relief of the fatigue. Fatigue consistently returned within 15 minutes if the dilator was removed and promptly resolved when reinserted, indicating the lack of any association with sleep. Systemic reactions to nasal disease are well documented in the medical literature but fatigue, when associated with nasal obstruction, is generally considered secondary to sleep abnormalities. Before the clear association of nasal obstruction and sleep abnormalities was known, reports in the older literature postulated a “nasal reflex” to explain the resolution of fatigue and a number of other significant complaints after nasal surgery or cauterization. In 1898, Wells reported cases of neurological and mental manifestations of nasal disease associated with extraordinary fatigue.* At the time of the linkage of nasal symptoms with fatigue and inability to concentrate was well accepted enough to generate the term “aprosexia nasalis.” More recent research documents profound changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, nasal stimulation is associated with vasoconstruction, laryngeal construction, and bronchoconstriction. Cottle maintained that air currents stimulating the nasal mucosa effect remote organs by nerve pathways and may be responsible for a state of ill health. Nasal valve movements, he also noted, were largely responsible for the “rest” obtained by the body during sleeps5 This case report suggests that unilateral nasal obstruction may be responsible for fatigue independent of any effect it might have on sleep.",

Thus, someone could remain symptomatic from concussion more than two weeks following the injury. At that point, however, the discerning clinician must differentiate prolonged concussion symptoms from the evolution of persistent symptoms from comorbid neurologic conditions or emerging mental health symptoms or disorders. Too often, prolonged or persistent symptoms are not considered in the context of initial concussion injury and symptoms, proper return to activity, or emerging comorbid conditions that can also lead to persistent symptoms.",

Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью.

Signs reach their maximum on day 5 and usually resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Withdrawal syndrome is more common with short half-life drugs (paroxetine, fluvoxamine). The intensity of the clinical signs depends on the daily dose and how long the drug has been given. The main signs are dizziness, vertigo, headache, nausea, and flu-like symptoms as well as anxiety, confusion, irritability, excessive dreaming and insomnia. Risk factors usually stressed are poor treatment compliance, previous withdrawal syndrome with another drug, concomitant medication and alcohol consumption. The syndrome can be prevented by tapering off the dose and patient education. When a withdrawal syndrome is present, it is advisable to reintroduce the drug then withdraw gradually.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Restless legs is a medical disorder and can be treated",
      "abstract": "Movement disorders have long been an interest of the Editor of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment (Brimblecombe and Pinder 1972). Movement disorders can manifest as slowness or poverty of movement (hypokinesias) or as abnormal involuntary movements (hyperkinesias). Two of the commonest hyperkinesias are essential tremor, which has been described in a previous issue of the journal (Uccellini et al 2006), and restless legs syndrome (RLS), which occupies much of the current issue and was also reviewed in a recent issue (Byrne et al 2006).\r\n\r\nRLS is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the limbs accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, leading to disturbed sleep and a poor quality of life. Symptoms usually begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, and are partly or completely relieved by active movement. Symptoms tend to worsen in the evening and at night. Not all cases where legs are restless are due to RLS, and it can be distinguished from nocturnal leg cramps, positional discomfort, and akathisia. However, almost all RLS patients also experience periodic limb movements (PLMs) during sleep or while awake. RLS is a chronic neurological condition that occurs in two forms, a primary disorder independent of other disorders, and a form that is secondary to other conditions such as pregnancy, iron deficiency, and end-stage renal disease.\r\n\r\nRLS affects about 5%–10% of the general adult population, but the risk increases in the elderly and in women. It can also affect children and adolescents, and is more common in children with ADHD. An early age of onset is indicative of a family history, while the familial nature of RLS is indicated by the demonstration of linkage to several chromosomal loci. The pathogenesis involves dopaminergic dysfunction, iron metabolism, and abnormalities in supraspinal inhibition.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis is simple and based upon well-validated criteria. Nevertheless, RLS is misunderstood, frequently misdiagnosed, often classified as a psychogenic disorder, and patients can suffer inappropriate treatment and consequent distress. With correct diagnosis, counseling, and reassurance, many patients will not require pharmacological treatment which will be determined by the severity and nature of the symptoms. Treatment of secondary RLS should focus on the underlying cause where possible. Some drugs may exacerbate RLS, including antidepressants particularly tricyclics and fluoxetine, some antiemetics, calcium channel blockers, phenytoin, and excessive consumption of caffeine or alcohol especially at bedtime. Evidence-based treatment guidelines for RLS are available (Byrne et al 2006). Dopaminergic therapies are first-line treatments but there is also substantial, but lesser, evidence for the efficacy of some antiepileptic dugs especially gabapentin, for opioids like oxycodone and propoxyphene, for benzodiazepines particularly clonazepam, and for the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine. Iron therapy, despite the evidence for the involvement of iron in the causality of RLS, has not been consistently shown to be effective, although it is recommended whenever serum ferritin levels are low.\r\n\r\nIn this issue of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment the biopsychosocial aspects of RLS and particularly mental health problems like disturbances of mood and cognition are reviewed (Becker 2006), as well as the major influence that RLS has on sleep especially when it is accompanied by PLMs (Bogan 2006). Both authors also briefly review treatment options and conclude that the evidence base is strongest for dopaminergic therapies and in particular ropinirole. Disturbed sleep, diminished quality of life, and mood symptoms are all alleviated by therapy with dopamine agonists. Individual dopaminergic agents are also reviewed. Ropinirole is currently the only FDA-approved therapy for RLS, a decision based upon several large scale clinical trials which established its safety and efficacy in treating the motor symptoms of RLS and improving sleep quality (Kushida 2006). Oral pramipexole (Benbir and Guilleminault 2006) and transdermal rotigotine (Bunten and Happe 2006), which are approved in many countries for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, have also undergone successful large-scale, randomized, and placebo-controlled trials in RLS. Data on pramipexole and rotigotine are promising, and both drugs should be soon added to the armamentarium of treatments for RLS. Other dopaminergic agents useful in RLS include L-dopa itself and the ergot derivatives pergolide and cabergoline (Becker 2006; Bogan 2006). Restless legs is a medical disorder that can be safely and effectively treated.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

      "abstract": "A prerequisite to the diagnosis of vegetative state is the exclusion of apparently similar syndromes, in which the patient retains the consciousness partially or even completely. Some syndromes are not separate nosological entities and should be abandoned: the apallic state, the neocortical death, the decerebrate and decorticate state, the alpha-coma, the vigil or prolonged or irreversible coma are among them. Three conditions deserve special consideration. The term locked-in syndrome describes a patient completely paralysed and mute, but fully conscious, and is usually caused by ischemic lesions of the pons. Several variants do exist, either in the causes and site of lesion. Some patients may become paralysed and mute, but conscious because of polyneuropathies, that is in the absence of any lesions of the central nervous system. The akinetic mutism is a rare condition characterised by loss of speech and nearly absent bodily movements. Painful stimulation may cause appropriate withdrawing, and wakefulness and self-awareness may be preserved, but cognitive impairment is usually present. It must be emphasised that this condition can be due to potentially treatable lesions, such as hydrocephalus and craniopharyngioma. The term \"minimally responsive\" or \"minimally conscious\" describes severely disabled patients in whom meaningful responses can be demonstrated, although inconstantly. This condition, the true diagnostic challenge, often represents a transition phase of vegetative patients recovering consciousness. Physicians, physiotherapists and patient's relatives should work all together to reach a correct diagnosis, by using current available methods to monitorize the recovery of consciousness.",

      "title": "Contributions to Psychiatry of Recent Studies on Sleep",
      "abstract": "RésuméUne revue de quelques-unes des contributions les plus récentes des études sur le sommeil à la psychiatrie a été présentée. Les effets d'une privation de sommeil dépendent de plusieurs facteurs tels que l'âge, la prise de médicaments, l'état de santé physique et psychologique du sujet et le type de privation (total versus sélectif). Il peut y avoir atteinte des fonctions affectives, cognitives, sensori-perceptuelles, musculo-squelettiques et autonomes. Certains chercheurs pensent que l'état obtenu à la suite d'une privation prolongée de sommeil est un véritable état psychotique tandis que d'autres pensent que des sujets normaux peuvent endurer sans trop de mal une perte prolongée de sommeil; mais un comportement psychotique marqué a été noté chez des sujets ayant des traits de personnalité prédisposants et des patients schizophrènes reconnus ont montré une réactivation de leurs symptômes. Dans la plupart des cas, une privation totale du sommeil provoque une diminution des pulsions tandis qu'une privation sélective augmente ces pulsions et accroît l'excitabilité du système nerveux central. Les personnes présentant une insomnie fonctionnelle, en plus de se plaindre de problèmes communs aux gens âgés, présentent des profils polygraphiques de sommeil semblables à ceux des gens âgés, mais reposant vraisemblablement sur une base physiologique différente. Jusqu'à maintenant, ces études polygraphiques n'ont permis de déterminer aucune caractéristique qui permettrait de différencier une dépression réactionnelle-névrotique d'une dépression psychotique. En ce qui concerne la majorité des états dépressifs, les chercheurs notent de façon générale, une latence accrue dans l'apparition du sommeil, des réveils fréquents, un temps réduit de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et un allongement du sommeil de la phase avec mouvements oculaires (PMO) (tel qu'il peut être observé dans les cas de dépression induits par la réserpine). Les patients atteints de manie montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et du sommeil PMO. On a rapporté chez les schizophrènes aigus une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement du sommeil PMO, un accroissement de l'activité de pointes ponto-géniculo-occipitales (P.G.O.) et une absence du phénomène de “rebound” PMO notée habituellement après privation du sommeil PMO. Des observations similaires ont été effectuées sur des chats préalablement traités avec p-chloro-phenylalanine (un inhibiteur de la synthèse de sérotonine); certains traits de comportement présentés par ces animaux ont été qualifiés de “psychotiques” par certains chercheurs. Comparativement aux cas aigus, les patients schizophrènes chroniques montrent un même accroissement de l'activité de pointes P.G.O. mais une privation de sommeil PMO amène un “rebound” exagéré. Les patients présentant des états confusionnels aigus, de l'hallucinose ou du delirium tremens causés par des agents métaboliques toxiques ou l'alcool montrent un accroissement de sommeil PMO après disparition de l'agent toxique. Généralement, les patients présentant des syndromes cérébraux chroniques et un état de démence montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, une réduction du temps de sommeil PMO et un accroissement ou une réduction du sommeil à ondes lentes. Dans les cas de retard mental, on a trouvé une plus grande proportion de sommeil PMO (par rapport au sommeil total) que chez les sujets normaux. L'énurésie nocturne, le somnambulisme, les cauchemars et la terreur nocturne se produisent habituellement durant un éveil (“arousal”) survenu dans la phase des ondes lentes. Les sédatifs, les phénothiazines et les antidépresseurs provoquent une réduction de temps de sommeil PMO. La réserpine, les tranquillisants mineurs et particulièrement les psychomimétiques provoquent un allongement du sommeil PMO. On a discuté de quelques hypothèses plausibles concernant la pathophysiologie de certains désordres psychiatriques et les mécanismes d'action des mesures thérapeutiques.",

For example, people are afraid of a new stroke or are unable to resume work because they have concentration problems. Because the psychosocial consequences for the outside world are not always visible, more structural attention is needed. Low-threshold aftercare by nurses provides this essential attention to psychosocial problems: people feel reassured.

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

Subjects fell into three groups according to presence of insomnia symptom (s) and/or sleep dissatisfaction. Results Insomnia symptoms occurred in 36.2% of subjects. Most of these (75.9%), however, reported no sleep dissatisfaction. In comparison, those also with sleep dissatisfaction had higher prevalence of sleep and mental disorders and longer duration of insomnia symptoms, and were more likely to take sleep-promoting medication, dread bedtime, and complain of light sleep, poor night-time sleep and daytime sleepiness. Conclusions Insomnia sufferers differ as to whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with sleep. Although insomnia symptoms are common in the general population, sleep disturbances among sleep-dissatisfied individuals are more severe. Sleep dissatisfaction seems a better indicator of sleep pathology than insomnia symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Infants epidemiologically at high risk for SIDS demonstrate a variety of abnormalities in sleep-state organization, maturation, and sleep-state modulation of cardio-respiratory control mechanisms. These involve both the REM and quiet-sleep states and are seen in twins who have had no evidence of clinical cardio-respiratory compromise during infancy as well as in near-miss infants who have suffered serious cardio-respiratory failure. Although these infants have higher levels of REM sleep around 40 weeks, of special concern is the decrease in the maturation of the quiet system, which becomes evident after 44 weeks, and the reported quiet-sleep abnormalities in reflex control of respiration and arousal. The source of these abnormalities is environmental rather than genetic and most likely occurs prenatally. During the critical period for SIDS, infant sleep begins to coalesce from a series of naps to more prolonged night time sleep periods that last up to 8 hours. We believe that the ability to maintain physiologic homeostasis during prolonged sleep is a challenge facing infants who are epidemiologically at risk for sudden infant death. The challenge facing sleep research is the more complete understanding of the relationship between prolonged inhibition, homeostasis, arousal, and development.",

Nocturnal groaning (NG) is a parasomnia characterized by an expiratory monotonous vocalization occurring during sleep, especially in REM sleep and during the second half of the night. The pathogenesis of NG remains still unclear and many hypotheses arose, ranging from the persistence of a vestigial ventilatory pattern rather than an expiratory upper airways' obstruction. Sleep microstructure fluctuation might modulate the NG, since the end of the NG episode usually is synchronized with a cortical arousal and an autonomic activation. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiology of SB and NG, especially when the two phenomena are associated.",

It is clear that, throughout the millennia, delirium has been — and still is — a highly lethal syndrome; a poor mental outcome for survivors was often noted. Not until the twentieth century was it thought that delirium was marked by a full recovery among survivors, and this was probably due to the desire for a clear distinction from dementia.",

The cause remains underdetermined and most of the treatments are ineffective. Antidepressants drugs may be helpful. A supportive approach, cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise seem so far the only evidence-based therapeutic approach.",

      "title": "Pengelolaan Gangguan Persepsi Sensori: Halusinasi Pendengaran Dengan Severe Depressive Episode With Psychotic Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Sensory perception disorder is a condition that occurs in a person who experiences changes in the shape and number of stimuli that come from outside, resulting in a sensory perception disorder: hallucinations. One of the sensory perception disorders is auditory hallucinations, where the patient will experience changes in perception and often hear false or unreal whispers and have no form. The purpose of writing this scientific paper is to describe the management of sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms at Wisma Drupad RSJ Prof. Dr. Soerojo Magelang. This type of research uses a descriptive method with the approach used, namely the nursing care approach including nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions, nursing implementation and nursing evaluations. The data obtained from the perception assessment that the patient said he heard a whisper, usually appeared when the patient was alone or doing activities. The patient is confused, daydreaming, pacing, the patient is disturbed and uncomfortable with whispering sounds. Whispers are not clear but real audible. Whispers were frequent and countless. So that a nursing diagnosis of Daignosis disorder was established which was enforced by sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations. The interventions arranged were teaching SP 1 how to rebuke hallucinations, SP 2 with 5 correctly taking medication, SP 3 controlling hallucinations by talking and SP 4 controlling hallucinations by doing favorite activities or positive activities. Furthermore, the implementation of SP1, SP2 and SP3 and an evaluation is carried out at the end of management. Based on the results of nursing management, it can be concluded that the problem of sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations is partially resolved by reducing the frequency of hallucinations.&#x0D; &#x0D; ABSTRAK&#x0D; Gangguan persepsi sensori adalah suatu keadaan yang terjadi dalam diri seseorang yang mengalami perubahan bentuk dan jumlah rangsangan yang datang dari luar sehingga mengakibatkan terjadinya gangguan persepsi sensori: halusinasi.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients Presenting with Psychosocial Crisis",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Traumatic and crisis inducing events are increasing in the world. The spectrum of crisis events includes both public events that have a significant social impact, such natural catastrophes that affect entire communities, airplane crashes, or terrorist attacks, and private events, including interpersonal domestic violence, suicide attempts, the loss of a loved one, or the start of serious physical or mental illness. A person's life can change dramatically as a result of exposure to a crisis situations and incidents. Crisis situations and natural disasters, which disrupt daily life, can affect every community. A crisis frequently involves adversity, which are defined by a very distressing state of uncertainty, a perceived threat to core beliefs, and disruptions to daily routines. Crisis can be a challenge or an opportunity for efficient problem solving and growth, or it can be a crippling event that results in sudden disequilibrium, unsuccessful coping mechanisms, and dysfunctional behavioral patterns.[1] Crisis are also distinguished in two main ways. A one-time, acute single event crisis or more chronic state of crisis also sometimes called as complex trauma. Terr also used the term type 1 and 2 crisis for the above subtypes, respectively.[2] Crises may have a significant impact on a person's health, functioning, and general well-being. Stress, worry, uncertainty, physical discomfort, and trauma-related mental health issues are typical outcomes. Health effects due to exposure to crisis have been studied extensively, and in recent decades there has been an emphasis on various mental health consequences including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several other psychiatric disorder like major depression, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, substance use disorders, personality disorders, etc., are reported to be having higher prevalence in people exposed to traumatic events of different kind in various phases of the life. However, the disorders specifically related to exposure to crisis, trauma, and stress are grouped separately both in ICD-11 and DSM-5. For these disorders, exposure to stressor in necessary for making a diagnosis. The details are given in following Table 1.Table 1: Disorders related to stress in ICD-11 and DSM-5The crisis interventions have a very long and rich history. The evidence for successful application of psychotherapeutic interventions in military settings were reported since long.[3] The politicians, administrators, other policymakers, at the society and local community level, should better understand psychosocial difficulties and problems encountered after traumatic events exposure for facilitation of service provisions and health force training and supervision. This clinical practice guideline aims to integrates psychosocial principles of crisis intervention. The model of psychosocial crisis management (PCM) describes how the tasks of crisis managers or crisis intervention workers (CIW) can be guided by principles of psychosocial support. Crisis management insights and psychosocial support principles originated from different several different disciplines and research. Currently, integrating strategies from various models helps in formulating better guidelines and strategies. Several different models of early interventions were tried in forms of disaster mental health programs, crime crisis intervention, or community mental health-based crisis intervention for early identification and help of the individuals suffering from the effect of crisis. Experts have cautioned, nonetheless, that even if a great desire and willingness to assist is not based on factual and scientific strategies, it may be ineffective or even detrimental to the clients.[4] Crises are disruptions with a potential psychosocial impact [Table 2]. The psychosocial dimension of crisis management, and can, therefore, strengthen crisis management in general. Crisis often refers to normal stresses and strain. Each crisis has a continuum, from negative to positive, and the resultant outcome depends upon a balance between the two opposing forces. Crisis in the context of current context is defined in specific terms. The following are important terms in context of crisis intervention.Table 2: Components of crisisRoberts defines a crisis as \"a period of psychological disequilibrium, experienced as a result of a hazardous event or situation that constitutes a significant problem that cannot be remedied by using familiar coping strategies [Figure 1].\"[1] An intensely stressful, traumatic, or serious event combined with the person's faulty perception resulting into psychological disruption and the individual's inability to resolve it are the primary factors requiring crisis intervention. Coping mechanisms that could have helped the person cope are either insufficient or not used at all. Later, James and Gilliland define crises as events or situations perceived as intolerably difficult that exceed an individual's available resources and coping mechanisms.[5]Figure 1: Core conceptualization of crisisCritical incident is a term which refers to an event which is exceptional and outside the individual's usual range of experience and challenges one's ability to cope successfully. The critical incident has the potential to cause a crisis condition by overwhelming one's usual psychological defenses and coping mechanisms [Table 3].Table 3: Factors influencing reactions to the crisisCoping behaviors are active efforts to resolve stress and create new solutions to the challenges of the situation. Coping involves the ability to gain and process new information; the ability to maintain control of one's emotional state; and the ability to move freely within one's environment. Coping behaviors are the source of new, original, unique, and creative solutions or behaviors. In this process, one develops adaptive ego functions that provide resources for coping in the subsequent stages or situations. If a crisis is not resolved in a positive manner, it can lead to destructive forces and psychopathology. Few examples of crises An accident, Natural disaster, Death/loss of a loved one, Onset or deterioration of Physical illness, Financial difficulties, Divorce/separation, Unexpected pregnancy, Employment loss. Clinicians need to address the level of distress, impairment, and instability in a rational and methodical way while confronted with a person in crisis.[5] Although, many clinicians may be aware about the best approaches for the crisis intervention, being in stressful situations, they may revert to strategies that are less than effective. Hence, it is important to have a quick and useful reference guide for do's and don'ts for crisis intervention workers [Tables 4-6].Table 4: Characteristics of the crisis interventionTable 5: Primary aims of the crisis interventionsTable 6: Factors influencing long term recoveryImmediate aftermath of acute crisis event, there are factors that help in long-term recovery and prevention of adverse sequalae over a period of time. Several practice models have been developed to help in assessment and intervention during crisis intervention over the years. MODELS OF CRISIS ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION Models of assessment Triage Assessment System: it was developed by Myer,[6] who proposed to assess crisis reactions in three domains: Affective (emotional) reactions: include three pairs of emotions anger/hostility, anxiety/fear, and sadness/melancholy. If more than one pair of emotions are present, it is rated as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Accurate assessment of primary emotion provides an opportunity to deal with the feeling and proving appropriate support. Cognitive (thinking) reactions: client's perception of how the crisis has affected, is affecting or will affect his or her physical, psychological, social, and moral/spiritual life. The perceptions may include transgression, threat, and loss. Behavioral (actions) reactions: include approach/avoidance and immobility. It may be constructive or maladaptive. Each domain is rated on a scale of 1 (no impairment) to 10 (Severe impairment). The score of all the domains is added together to give an overall severity. The higher is the severity, the more is the impairment. In addition to this, the client assessment includes assessment for suicidality, lethality, risk of harm to others, etc., based on the clinical situation. The details of these aspects are not included in this guideline and can be seen at other relevant places. MODELS OF MANAGEMENT 1. Gilliland's Six-Step Model: it was developed by James and Gilliland[5] and is a useful crisis intervention model. It includes three listening and three action steps. i) Listening: focuses on: a. defining the problem, b. ensuring client safety, c. providing support, ii) Action: focuses on: a. examining alternatives, b. making plans, c. obtaining commitment. A few important components of listening are observing, understanding, empathetically responding, respect for the client, acceptance, non-judgmental attitude, and caring. Action denotes those steps done in a nondirective and collaborative manner. It is also important to assess the needs of the client and the environmental supports available to him. 2. Seven-Stage Model of Crisis Intervention: It was developed by Roberts[1] and it contains the following seven stages: i. Conducting a thorough biopsychosocial and crisis assessment (including assessment of suicidal and homicidal risk, need for medical attention, drug, and alcohol use, etc.). The crisis worker should assess the lethality first and confirm whether the client has initiated say, for example, a suicidal attempt. If not, the crisis worker should assess the client's intent for self-harm. It is recommended to get that information from the client through an artful interviewing style rather than by direct questioning. ii. Making psychological contact and establishing rapport. A therapeutic relationship with the client can be established through the counselor offered conditions like genuineness, respect, and acceptance of the client. To instill trust and confidence in the client, the crisis worker should practice good eye-to-eye contact, a non-judgmental attitude, creativity, flexibility, a positive attitude, and resilience. iii. Examining and defining the dimensions of the problem or crisis (including Identification of the precipitant to the crisis). Crisis workers should focus on the client's current problems, usually, that precipitated the crisis. It will also help to understand how the situation escalated to a crisis and how the client tried to cope with the crisis. This will help the crisis workers to plan and suggest necessary modifications to the client to resolve the current crisis and prevent future crises. iv. Exploration of feelings and emotions mainly by actively listening and responding with encouraging statements. The crisis workers should allow the client to vent his or her distress/feelings. Active listening skills like paraphrasing, reflecting feelings, and probing are useful in this stage. In this stage, the crisis workers should work challenging responses (providing information, reframing, and interpretation) into the crisis-counseling dialogue that may help to undo the client's maladaptive beliefs. v. Exploration of past positive coping strategies of client and alternatives if any. Crisis workers need to be creative and flexible in resolving crises. The crisis worker and client can discuss the available options on the table (e.g., a no-suicide contract) for ensuring the client's safety. Some authors recommended integrating solution-focused therapy techniques viz., \"Amplifying Solution Talk\" in this stage. vi. Implementation of the action plan. It is important to identify supportive individuals and contact referral sources The action plans (e.g., entering a 12-step treatment program, joining a support group, etc.) implemented at this stage are important for restoring the client's equilibrium and psychological balance. Roberts highlighted the importance of the cognitive dimension of the client at this stage that will help to gain mastery over the crisis and to cope with similar situations in the future.[1] vii. Follow-up plan with clients to ensure that the crisis has been resolved Also, the post-crisis evaluation of the client is to be done that may include the client's physical condition, overall functioning, cognitive mastery of the precipitating event, the progress of the treatment, and need for any referral (e.g., legal, medical, etc.). In this stage, it is recommended to have a \"booster session\" with the client (usually after a month of termination of the crisis) to assess treatment gains and potential problems. Location Location of crisis intervention strategies is dependent on the crisis intervention program, target population, and available resources. Crisis intervention is offered in clinical settings including emergency settings, makeshift offices in disaster sites, military settings, workplace, schools, and in community outreach centers or at homes. Additional factors influencing location might be local norms, culture, stigma of mental health, and administrative support, etc. MANAGEMENT Pharmacological treatment The choice of treatment is determined by several factors. Availability of treatment options, time and resources available, and choice of treatment by the patient are some of the important considerations. Although, psychological interventions remain the treatment of choice, unavailability of therapist, unwillingness, or inability of the clients to undertake psychological interventions are important reasons for choosing pharmacological treatment options. In practice, most patients with sufficiently severe psychopathology receive a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The pharmacological treatment options available have following important caveats that all medications have some potential for adverse reactions and the empirical base for effectiveness of pharmacological treatment options is limited.[7] Hence, the treatment approach remains symptom based and empirical. SSRIs are considered the first line agents. However, SDAs, mood stabilizers, sedative/hypnotics, and antihypertensives are commonly used for the management of symptoms. Best practice prescribing strategies are followed for drug treatment. It primarily includes information prior to commencement, regular monitoring of response, adverse effects, and suicidal risk. Minimum number of medications is used, and polypharmacy is avoided as far as possible. Appropriate discontinuation and withdrawal practices are followed [Table 7].Table 7: Commonly used medications for psychiatric conditions related to stressPsychological interventions The crisis intervention strategies are offered in various settings including outpatient psychiatric clinics, community mental health centers, counseling centers, or crisis intervention settings. Crisis theory is developed over a period of time using inputs from a variety of disciplines and schools of thought. The commonly used crisis intervention models nowadays are often eclectic mixtures of psychoanalytic, existential, humanistic, cognitive-behavioral, and family system theories.[8] Crisis interventions (CI) are problem-focused, brief mental health interventions that are typically used within 4 to 6 weeks of exposure to a stressor or crisis. It is one of the most commonly used time-limited treatment modalities in the world.[9] This clinical practice guidelines outline broader model and approaches useful in crisis situations. The crisis intervention worker can adapt it appropriately according to the local cultural and contextual issues. An earlier clinical practice guidelines of Indian psychiatric society has been developed for supportive psychotherapy which deals with a related topic.[10] It can also be referred for additional information and further details. The mental health needs of the people exposed to a significant stressor or crisis are different and distinctive. Several different models of interventions are available. This article doesn't aim to comprehensively elaborate and enlist all the available models. Although each situation and client's needs are different, a few common steps can be applied across the situations. It is aimed to discuss common components of these models and essential strategies found successful across different models. Crisis intervention can be offered in multiple settings to a variety of individuals or groups including primary and secondary victims. The deceased, the injured, and their family and friends are examples of primary victims because they were directly involved in the critical event. The term \"secondary victims\" refers to anyone who is somehow witnesses to the immediate traumatic consequences on the initial victims, such as eyewitnesses, rescuers, and converging rescuers. Accordingly, the strategies can be for individual or group settings. A broad range of possible crisis and individual reactions, the severity of distress, and the use of coping strategies call for a reasonable individualization in approaches for every situation [Table 5]. A variety of professionals can conduct crisis intervention (CI). A psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker, or psychiatric nurse can learn to use these skills and can conduct successful crisis intervention. For this document, for the brevity of writing, any professional conducting CI is referred to as crisis intervention worker (CIW). The important steps of crisis intervention are discussed below [Figure 2].Figure 2: Core conceptualization of crisis interventionEstablishing a rapport There are certain general strategies for establishing and strengthening rapport with the client. Many clients have limited attention span, feel distracted, have difficulty at focusing, or are extremely anxious owning to emotional upheaval after experiencing a psychosocial crisis. The crisis intervention worker should be vigilant about these issues and make appropriate alterations in the interview style for the same. Initial success in crisis intervention is largely dependent on the crisis intervention workers' ability to put the client at ease and alleviate these emotional reactions. Asking small questions, and frequently checking if the client can understand and appreciate what is being said is important. At the beginning of the interview, crisis intervention worker has to introduce himself/herself and need to inform the reasons for speaking to the client. Unless the reason for the consultation is implicit (the client himself/herself has come to the crisis intervention workers), crisis intervention workers should take consent for further proceeding. The crisis intervention workers should also inform about the nature of the interview and the approximate amount of time needed. The client is informed that they are free to make suggestions regarding the intervention format and they will not be pushed to talk or cooperate against their wishes. The information regarding privacy and confidentiality is also provided to the client. The information is shared with others only if there is a serious concern related to the safety and security of the client or relevant others (e.g., suicidal or homicidal intent). A respectful, non-judgmental, and considerate environment is created during the interaction. Clients are often going through considerable distress, emotional pain, and feeling vulnerable and uncertain about several things. It must be acknowledged, and due consideration is given during the interaction. This respectful and considerate environment significantly contributes to the development of rapport. Few key clinical skills are discussed in this regard Active listening- The most basic yet most important skill in psychological therapeutic interventions remains active listening. Active listening is paying attention to the verbal and non-verbal speech of the client and ongoing reactions to it so that clients know that they are being heard and understood. The components of active listening include adequate eye contact, attentive, and encouraging body language like appropriate head nodding, slight leaning toward the client while talking, appropriate facial/hand gestures, and vocal style showing concern. Questioning techniques- A combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions is used during the interview. As usual, it is better to start with open-ended questions and gather information. Close needed questions are useful in completing important areas which are missed like the further elaboration of the information provided till now and evaluating the risk of suicide/homicide or other risky behaviors. Certain interviewing techniques are also useful. Clarifying: It aims at clearly understanding what is being said. The crisis intervention workers may ask questions to clarify and to also show that he/she is actively listening. Paraphrasing: Crisis intervention workers restate what clients have already spoken in simpler words emphasizing factual and cognitive aspects. Summarizing: Summarizing is used to bring focus to the most important aspects of crisis intervention workers' understanding. Feedback is taken from the client so that both mutually agree on the extent of the problems and difficulties. Reflection: Reflection is a statement that emphasizes the affective or emotional part of verbal or nonverbal speech of the client, e.g., sounds like you are angry with your boss, you seem to undergo humiliation while living with xxx. Reflection is a powerful technique to express empathy. Expressing empathy means letting the client know that crisis intervention worker understands the emotions and feelings being experienced by the client. Matching and mirroring nonverbal communication: Consciously matching and mirroring the postures, gestures, and facial expressions in subtle way improves rapport and communication. It is also important to note that crisis intervention workers should avoid confrontation, getting into debates and argument with the client. It should be accepted that every client's situation, needs, and context are different and \"clients\" are expert in their situation. Whenever appropriate, taking \"one-down position\" to client is useful to foster better therapeutic relationship in many situations. Evaluating the problem Crisis intervention workers need to evaluate several aspects of the crisis. The areas of inquiry include precipitating event, client's perceptions of meaning and reasons of the event, amount of subjective distress, and identifying different emotions being experienced by the client, as well as functioning in various areas of life like personal, familial, social, academic, and occupational, etc. The client's level of comfort and amount of distress is monitored while talking about the event. It is important to know that the clinician does not have to know everything about client's difficulty and the goals in order to successfully provide crisis intervention effectively. Exact and minute details of the event are not important and even maybe counterproductive to ask. Therapeutic strategies Assessment of the client's perception is one of the most important tasks in crisis intervention. This aspect is often the most important target for intervention in crisis intervention. It is the perception of the client and his/her ability to cope with the event that led to the current problem. Once the cognitions, perceptions, meaning of the event, and frame of reference regarding various aspects of the event are assessed, crisis intervention worker aims at addressing them to identify the thinking errors made by clients and alter these cognitions into more adaptable and helpful cognitions. This strategy of cognitive restructuring is an essential aspect of crisis intervention. Once this has been achieved, it leads to a reduction of the accompanying emotional distress. Usually, the dysfunction and distress originate from the following areas. a) Loss of control, b) Loss of self-esteem, c) Loss of support, d) Difficulty in adjustment to change in life or a role. The subjective distress and functioning levels of the client need to be independently assessed. It is helpful for the client if they can ventilate their difficult emotions, distressing feelings, and other associated behavioral and somatic symptoms. Functioning should be assessed in each area as improving functioning early during the treatment process is an important goal of therapy. Identifying and evaluating medical, psychiatric (including suicidal, homicidal, and substance use-related issues), social, and legal needs are other important tasks. These needs may be contributing to the effective application of healthy coping strategies. Appropriate referrals must be made once a client needs help in an important area that falls outside the expertise area of crisis intervention worker. Solution focused approach- The emphasis is on finding solutions rather than solving problems. The therapeutic skills are asking questions that achieve solutions through \"solution talk or change talk\" in comparison with \"problem talk.\" It is assessed that what has not worked till now. It is conveyed to the client that there are several approaches to feel better and improve in the current context. Emphasis is placed on the setting goals for future. It is important that goals are set by the client themselves and these are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time limited) as far as possible. Goals should be stated in positive rather than negatives, i.e., rather than \"I want to stop feeling depressed\" or \"I don't want to keep laying all the day\" it can be \"I want to feel peaceful and safe\" and \"I want to start visiting markets and shops for my daily needs.\" During next part of the intervention, a few other strategies are also used as therapeutic interaction in crisis intervention. Education: It is important to educate the clients about the universalities of crisis in human life as well as perceptions and emotional reactions of other people who have experienced similar events, e.g., although unfortunate, about 30% of women have experienced intimate partner violence in marriage. It is common to experience sadness, anger, and helplessness during this time. However, there is a lot that can be done to improve the present situation and future risk of violence by your spouse. This educational information may lead to a reduction in the feeling of loneliness as well as empower the clients to take appropriate action. Many clients suffer due to a lack of reliable information and a tendency to unreasonably blame themselves. Educational statements may include information related to statistics, frequency, psychological impact, social perspective as well as scientific understanding of the issues related to crisis events. Empowerment: The process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. These statements are offered as a part of enabling the application of appropriate coping skills and healthy behaviors as part of recovery. Many clients believe that they have failed in anticipating or stopping the event hence they are unable to do so in the future also. They may also blame themselves or consider themselves weak, wrongful, or wicked. It is important to bring change in this perspective. Clients are presented with various choices and strategies to respond better presently. Crisis intervention worker who offers advice to and generate solution may sometimes quicken the crisis resolution; however, it may not lead to client empowerment. Concept of empowerment is helpful in improving resilience hence is helpful for current crisis as well as enable clients to deal with similar situations in the future more effectively. Validation: Validation is defined as recognition or affirmation that a person or their feelings or opinions are valid or worthwhile. During the treatment process, crisis intervention worker reassures and supports the clients often that the emotional experiences and distress experienced are normal after experiencing such a crisis and it will get better. The aim is also to encourage adaptive and helpful coping strategies for the clients. However, the validation and support statements are not the ones that may be perceived as false or empty. The clients often listen from well-meaning friends and family members that \"Don't worry,\" \"Everything will be okay,\" and \"You are strong and get through this.\" Crisis intervention workers are experts in dealing with such situations hence validation and support come from a deeper understanding of the client's unique difficulties as well as a scientific understanding of the recovery process. Reframe: The clients often have cognitive errors and may have a wrong frame of reference while interpreting crisis events. The clients are encouraged to adopt a realistic frame of reference. Coping At the end of the crisis intervention, crisis intervention worker should aim to summarize the formulation of the client's problem from the medical point of view, address cognitive re-structuring related to events and discussions focus on successful coping strategies. As the rapport with the client is established, the client starts becoming more comfortable due to a reduction in distress levels; he/she is encouraged to take a more active part during the interaction. The client is encouraged to enlist what they have been trying to do to cope with the event till now. Crisis intervention workers should focus on identifying and working with the client's strengths. Emphasizing strengths rather than deficits can help in facilitating better engagement and success of intervention. Earlier research has found that clients want therapist to think positive about them. Making hostile, rejecting, critical, or blaming comments elicit negative reactions toward therapy and therapist. The impact of coping strategies used so far is jointly evaluated. It is attempted to distinguish healthy/adaptive coping strategies from unhealthy/maladaptive coping strategies [Table 8].Table 8: Few examples of coping strategies which can be useful after facing a crisisThe client is asked to suggest a list of healthy/adaptive coping strategies that they can use in the present and future to deal with the undergoing crisis. Once the client has exhausted their ideas about coping strategies, the crisis intervention workers can also suggest some of the coping strategies which the client is not able to think of or is unaware of so that it can be discussed if these are practical strategies and can be of use to the client. Joint decision-making is encouraged at this stage. However, if the client is not able to focus, unable to come up with possible coping strategies, or is indecisive regarding the practical utility of the strategy, they may be encouraged to try the technique and discuss its impact with the crisis intervention workers. Possible hurdles to the implementation of the strategies discussed are also inquired about. Once the list of hurdles, e.g., not having the motivation to go for a walk, feeling fatigued at the end of the day so that could not engage in my favorite hobby, not having the courage to make a call to my old friends as I have not connected with them for quite some time, etc., have been gathered, both crisis intervention workers and clients can jointly find out the plan to handle important issues. This activity significantly increases the chances of successful implantation of the discussion that happened in the session. Some other approaches found useful Support groups: The client may be encouraged to get in touch with local support groups. It might be more comfortable for the clients to receive support from a natural support group like peer groups, relatives, friends, religious groups, or co-workers if any such possibility is available to the client. There can be few organized peer support groups in certain parts of the country. The client is encouraged to try seeking the help of such groups. Journaling: Clients may find it helpful to keep a journal. Crisis intervention worker may encourage clients to maintain a secret/personal journal. Writing once thoughts, emotions, and other experiences allows the person to evaluate these more objectively. This is helpful in the recovery process for several individuals. Bibliography: There are several good books/websites/reading materials available for dealing with different kinds of crises. Advising quality reading material to interested clients is often helpful to people who like to read. Such resources are often developed both by experts and first-person accounts of persons who have gone through a similar crisis are available. Keeping a list of such resources and advising capable clients to use is helpful in several instances. Medical and legal referrals: Many clients may require medical and legal referrals but may be avoiding the same due to several reasons. The crisis intervention worker can direct them to seek appropriate referrals and can help in making some provisions in this regard with any other helping agency, if available. There are several specific models for crisis intervention that are developed over a period of time for different situations. A few of the important models are summarized below. Psychological First Aid (PFA):[11] PFA is defined as a \"humane, supportive response to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support.\" PFA is aimed offered to the people who have immediately experienced extremely stressful events. This model of care takes into account both psychological and social aspects of care needed for persons during the early course of exposure to stressors. Special attention is given to focusing on the preservation of the dignity, culture, or abilities of the person to whom the intervention is being offered. The evidence of PFA has been compared with psychological debriefing and it was found that PFA is superior to psychological debriefing in crises. The strategies of PFA have evidence of successful application in low and middle-income countries and these can be offered even by non-professional people also. PFA can be used by non-professionals and professional both. Booklet of PFA is available for free download from https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548205 (Last accessed 22 June, 2022). Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM):[12] CISM is evolved from earlier CI programs and group psychological debriefing techniques. CISM was originally developed for emergency service personals like fire department, first line police, rescue or disaster teams and military settings. It is defined as an integrated, multicomponent, and comprehensive intervention program useful for both the primary and secondary victims. The strategies are included for pre-crisis preparation, acute crisis intervention, and post-crisis management. Both individual and group strategies are incorporated usually lasting from 4-12 sessions. Pre-crisis preparation may be thought of as a form of \"psychological immunization.\" The aim of this phase is to strengthen potential psychological vulnerabilities and enhance resilience in individuals specifically who are at risk of developing crisis reactions. It includes providing information so as to have realistic expectations about the stress responses. It also incorporates stress response management, behavioral regulation, improved coping, and practical strategies to help and support each other for people involved. CONCLUSION Crises are common human experiences and a subset of vulnerable people develops clinically significant difficulties necessitating intervention. Evidence-based clinical interventions are available that can be offered to persons in need. Typically, therapeutic interventions needed for crises are offered as early as possible, is problem focused, simple and brief. Therapeutic strategies used in crises are often derived from an eclectic mix of strategies from various psychological intervention models. The major clinical issues are assessed in domains of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral domains. Interventions are focused on handling psychological reactions as well as providing help, information, and support regarding social issues, if feasible. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Control of respiration is quite complex, requiring inputs from a variety of sources working in concert to provide the neuromuscular interface necessary to maintain respiratory drive. In obstructive sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked and marked effort on the part of the individual is required until the obstruction is broken, allowing respiration to occur again. If the apnea is sustained and frequent, one may see end organ damage. Muscle tone and neural output is changed during sleep. In obstructive sleep apnea, the majority of people have no difficulty breathing during the day, however during their normal sleeping time, these neuromuscular inputs are altered in such a fashion that the obstruction occurs. It is not uncommon for a Mueller type maneuver to occur, which increases vagus tone leading to bradycardia, sinus arrest and even asystole. Hypoxemia leads to increased sympathetic discharge which in turn can lead to systemic hypertension.",

Depression, the most common mental disorder in later life, is a major precipitating factor in suicide. Alcoholism is another major precipitating factor in late-life suicide. Approximately one-third of all suicides are alcoholics. Many of the same factors which contribute to depression also increase the risk of alcoholism and/or suicide. Loss, stress, loneliness, low self-esteem, and feelings of anxiety, rejection, helplessness, and hopelessness characterize late life alcoholism and depression. Alcoholism, depression, and suicide form a deadly triangle. Family, caregivers, and practitioners need to be aware of the deadly relationship between alcoholism, depression, and suicide in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

Sleep-onset and maintenance insomnia is a characteristic feature of schizophrenic patients regardless of either their medication status (drug-naive or previously treated) or the phase of the clinical course (acute or chronic). Regarding sleep architecture, the majority of studies indicate that stage 4 sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) latency are reduced in schizophrenia, whereas REM sleep duration tends to remain unchanged. Insomnia in schizophrenic patients could be partly related to the presumed over-activity of the dopaminergic system. However, there is a possibility that the GABAergic system is also involved in sleep disturbance in schizophrenia. Since many signal transmission systems within the CNS can be implicated in the reduction of REM latency in schizophrenia, the characterization of the neurotransmitter systems involved remains a challenging dilemma.",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "abstract": "he problems of coping with adolescence are greatly increased by an additional chronic disorder.This is particularly so for those with epilepsy, where there is social stigma and the need for potentially sedative and damaging medication.Epilepsy is the most common neurological condition among patients transferred from paediatric to adult care.Many of the problems encountered in the teenager with epilepsy are shared by those with other chronic disabilities. 1 2 This review considers the paediatric environment that the adolescent is leaving, the rationale for a teenage clinic, and the facets of this which make it a desirable facility. c THE TEENAGER WITH EPILEPSYEven when relatively mild, the impact of epilepsy on the teenager and on other members of the family may be profound.Epilepsy has important differences from other chronic disorders, particularly that the disability is intermittent, and so can be hidden.The perceived need to conceal epilepsy, and concern about seizures occurring in public, can induce great anxiety.The consequences of missing epilepsy, or treating it inappropriately, can be disastrous in terms of impaired education, employment, and driving prospects, unnecessary medication, and diminished self esteem.Perhaps these factors are of greater importance for teenagers than for those in other age groups: c Developing independence is impeded, education is at a critical stage, employment and driving prospects are just being realised, and issues of relationships, contraception, pregnancy, and parenthood are becoming increasingly relevant.c Deviations from peer group norms hold great importance for teenagers: epilepsy can be disastrous for self esteem and self identity.c Social handicaps acquired in childhood and adolescence can remain with the individual even after seizures have been adequately controlled.Complete control achieved before adult social and vocational responsibilities can help to avoid these problems.A relatively aggressive approach to treatment, including early consideration of epilepsy surgery, is therefore justified. THE TEENAGER CLINICTaking over a patient's care offers opportunities to reassess the diagnosis by reviewing the history, and to ensure appropriate investigations are to hand.This is best done in the setting of a specialist teenager epilepsy clinic.Developing teenagers often find paediatric clinics embarrassing and inappropriate.A transitional arrangement offers the benefit of consulting both an adult and a paediatric neurologist, supported by an epilepsy specialist nurse. 3The general principles of a teenager epilepsy consultation are listed in box 1.Two main patient groups are referred to this type of clinic: c Patients presenting with blackouts beginning as teenagers (referred from general or hospital practice) where the main initial issue is diagnosis.c Patients with ongoing and often complex epilepsy from childhood (referred from general paediatrics or paediatric neurology) where the main issue is ongoing management of the epilepsy.The following should be addressed at first contact: c Is the diagnosis of epilepsy correct?c If the diagnosis is epilepsy, which type is it?c Is the current epilepsy management appropriate?c Is there appropriate knowledge and understanding of the condition, its prognosis, and its lifestyle implications?In particular, will the seizures interfere with completion of education, training for a career/job, or qualification for a driving licence, and are there special social circumstances that need to be addressed? IS THE DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY CORRECT?A correct diagnosis is essential for the appropriate management of any patient with blackouts.Despite major advances in the technology for investigating blackouts, the most important investigation remains the taking and re-taking of the clinical history.",

      "abstract": "Medical rehabilitation is a multi-professional / interdisciplinary process aimed at enhancing and restoring functional ability (activity and participation) and quality of life to people with im-pairments or disabilities. Rehabilitation is applied throughout the continuum of care. COVID-19 patients may develop a myriad of acute medical problems (linked to the virus per se, or as con-sequences of the invasive procedures), which can cause acute, post-acute and long-term conse-quences requiring rehabilitation. Information about short and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 indicate an increasing need for rehabilitation. The paper is focused on two main aspects: rehabil-itation of the severe neurological disabilities that occurred during the acute phase and continu-ing in the chronic phase (i.e., different neurological sensory-motor and cognitive deficits sec-ondary to stroke, encephalitis, seizures, encephalopathies). The other main issue is generated by the disruption of regular rehabilitation in people with neurological disabilities and chronic dis-eases (people living with sequels after stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis) due to quarantine, social isolation, movement restriction, and other healthcare systems ’disruptions. Methods Internet literature search (Lit Covid and PubMed) using the following keywords (Covid-19, Coronavirus, neurological complications, rehabilitation). During 2020-2021 were published 88 papers (in 2020 = 54, and in 2021= 54), with 21 reviewes (2020 = 15; 2021 = 8), and 2 systematic reviews, refearing neuroreabilitation in Covid-19 subacutre and long-term cas-es.

Conclusions More than two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is obvious that rehabilitation services play a crucial role in post-COVID recovery trajectories. A further achievement of research and evidence focussed on the clinical management, comprehensive treatments, and efficacy need to be targeted on short and long-term (neuro)-rehabilitation service models of care, for COVID-19 survivors.

El paciente tipo de SAHOS, es un hombre obeso, de cuello corto, roncador de larga data, que acusa somnolencia diurna, sueño poco reparador, cansancio, nocturia y leve deterioro cognitivo. Su pareja observa la aparición progresiva de pausas respiratorias. Sin embargo, la presentación es heterogénea y se distinguen diferentes fenotipos clínicos. El diagnóstico se basa en la sospecha y la evaluación conjunta del cuadro clínico con estudios nocturnos confirmatorios adecuados, siguiendo algoritmos propuestos, usando desde PSG convencional hasta equipos simplificados. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common chronic and progressive disorder. It has cardiovascular, neurocognitive and metabolic consequences.

OSAS therapy is efficient and cost effective, so early diagnosis and treatment are important. The hallmark feature is the recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep, which is associated with hypopxia-reoxygenation and microarousal which contributes to the pathophysiology and symptoms which are not specific but quite suggestive of the disease. The typical presentation of OSAS is represented by an overweight, gross neck male patient complaining of loud snoring, nocturia, excessive daytime sleepiness and mild cognitive impairment, with a history of witnessed apnoeas during sleep. Obstructive apnoea has a quite heterogeneous presentation form and different clinical phenotypes have been recognized.

Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment.

The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

      "title": "Interphase between skin, psyche, and society: A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating a sufficient number of obstructive apneas (absence of airflow with continued respiratory effort) and/or obstructive hypopneas (reduction in airflow despite sufficient respiratory effort to produce normal airflow) (1). The daytime somnolence appears to result, in large part, from short, amnestic arousals that fragment and reduce the efficiency of sleep. OSA appears to affect about 4% of men and 2% of women between 30 and 60 years of age (3). OSA is associated with systemic hypertension, myocardial infarction, motor vehicle accidents, and cerebrovascular accidents (4-7).",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.",

These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

      "abstract": "Background Improving maternal's health is a worldwide priority. Sleep is a fundamental operating state of the central nervous system and it may be one of the most important psychophysiological processes for brain function and mental health. The study of maternal sleep problem including insomnia, however, implies deepening our understanding of family context. Family systems are dynamic and involve reciprocal interactions among members during day and night. So far, however, maternal and children's sleep has been rarely studied in a family perspective, and paternal sleep has often been neglected.Methods The present work summarizes in a narrative review the state of the art of our current knowledge on the role of insomnia and poor quality of sleep for mental health in all family members in the peripartum period. The mother, the father, the child and the family interactive perspectives are considered.Results Insomnia and poor sleep problems are frequent in all family members during peripartum. Poor sleep and insomnia symptoms are recognized as important risk factors for mental health in adults and children. Despite this alarming evidence, sleep is rarely assessed in clinical contextsConclusions Clinical implications include the utmost relevance of assessing sleep problems during pregnancy and early post-partum. Insomnia and poor sleep quality should be evaluated and treated in the clinical practice by using a \"family perspective.\"",

Particularly interesting is the association of seizure propensity and sleep stage, and the fact that seizures are very rare in REM sleep. Furthermore, sleep loss, and sleep disorders may impact epilepsy. Particularly robust is the effect of obstructive sleep apnea, a fairly common sleep disorder. Last but not least, circadian rhythms may have an interesting effect on seizure propensity. Studies in children and in adults indicate that the time when seizures occur may not be random and depends on the epileptogenic region, with frontal lobe seizures being more frequently occurring from sleep and during the early morning hours, and temporal lobe seizures occurring more frequently from wakefulness and in the mid to late afternoon.",

Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status.

Coma is a medical emergency, because a comatose patient is at high risk of permanent brain injury or death, caused either by the underlying disorder or the secondary effects of coma. Stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, and exclusion of hypoglycaemia are the first priorities, before diagnosis is explored further.

It is characterized by disturbances in perception, emotional regulation and thought processes, including symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, leading to a disconnection from reality. Patients often suffer when trying to meet the demands of ordinary life. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in development of psychosis. Besides these, there are also environmental influences, which contribute as a trigger and later progression of psychotic disorders. These external determinants could possibly be managed in attempts to contain the problem of increased mental health conditions with the main psychotic component.

      "abstract": "An intensive care unit (ICU) stay is often a stressful and painful experience. Recent surveys indicate that 50–80% of patients experience pain during their ICU stay [1]. Critically ill patients experience pain more readily than healthy subjects; a phenomenon known as hypernociception. The most painful experiences for ICU patients are endotracheal suctioning and being turned in bed. In addition, many patients have pain at rest without a noxious stimulus [1]. This decreased threshold of pain in the ICU has been attributed to immobility and systemic inflammation. In addition to pain, ICU patients often suffer from stress, which has been frequently attributed to painful procedures. Other factors that may play a role in ICU stress include inability to communicate due to endotracheal intubation, interruption of sleep, hallucinations, and nightmares. This stressful experience is not without complications, as one retrospective study found that 25% of ICU patients with self-reported stressful experiences during their ICU stay, such as nightmares, anxiety, respiratory distress, or pain, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder four years later [2], thus, the importance of adequate analgesia and sedation to achieve patient comfort.",

      "title": "Symptomatology and psychopathology of mental health problems after disaster.",
      "abstract": "A variety of reactions are observed after a major trauma. In the majority of cases these resolve without any long-term consequences. In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

      "title": "Putting the pieces together: The subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder",
      "abstract": "Throughout the history of psychology there is evidence of fragmentation, at multiple levels. As a result of this fragmentation knowledge of mental illness exists in the form of separate fragments or pieces, and the understanding of the subjective experience of a mental illness as a whole is often lost in the pieces. Such fragmentation is a concern as it has a significant impact on those suffering from a mental illness, as they may not feel understood, or aspects of their experience of mental illness may be missed or overlooked. Thus potentially reducing the individual's ability and willingness to approach and engage in treatment, reducing the possible efficacy of treatment and increasing the risk of relapse. The experience of not feeling understood, difficulties engaging in treatment and relapse are particularly common for individuals with anorexia nervosa, a disorder which has markedly been prey to the fragmentation in psychology. These experiences are concerning when one considers that anorexia nervosa is a chronic disorder, associated with severe physical and psychological consequences, including death, due to physical complications or suicide. The impact of the disorder stems beyond the individual, with families and care-givers also experiencing high levels of distress. Due to the risk, severity and chronic nature of anorexia nervosa, it is important that understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa is increased to foster research, development and implementation of efficacious interventions. These concerns led to the research question guiding this research: what is the human subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder? The purpose of a broad research question was to maximize the pieces of experience gathered, as well as establish the context of experiences, and thereby gathering a picture of the subjective experience of the disorder in its complexity.;As a vast array of, albeit fragmented, knowledge exists on anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, theories and hypotheses from the literature were used as points of triangulation. In order to capture the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa qualitative methodology was used, and 15 self defined recovered sufferers of anorexia nervosa were interviewed. During the interview, participants were asked to describe their experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, as well as comment on the perceived relevance of theory and hypotheses (or pieces of knowledge) from four different orientations (biological, social-cognitive, family and existential) that exist in the field. Data analysis involved gathering pieces from theory and participant experience, organizing these pieces, and working up from the data to establish a picture of an individual's experience at the different stages of the disorder, and how this changes over time. As the research was exploring both what is the subjective experience, and how it changes over time, data analysis was guided by both phenomenological and grounded theory methodology. An adapted form of Heidegger's (1962) worlds of being was also used, to assist organization of pieces, based on where the experience was in relation to the individual. From this analysis a Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, as well as phases of maintenance and recovery, were developed that meaningfully tie together pieces of experience, to capture the complex subjective experience of anorexia nervosa at different stages, and how an individual moves through the stages. The Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases increase the understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa, and have the capacity to assist research, development and implementation of efficacious treatment.;The development of the Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases, also acts as a small step towards resolving the issue of fragmentation, and recapturing the subjective experience of mental illness.",

Such pattern of disturbance is analogous to that of primary insomnia. • The relationship between pain and sleep is likely to be bi-directional, although exactly how the two problems interact is little understood. • The offer of sleep advice and the use of pharmacotherapy for pain-related insomnia have their respective limitations. Psychological and behavioural treatments demonstrated to be effective for both primary and comorbid insomnia may be a viable treatment alternative.",

Unfortunately, the catastrophic and debilitating consequences that result from alterations in sleep are usually noted after significant physical and emotional damage have occurred. Implications for Practice An assessment of sleep hygiene and the physical, emotional, or lifestyle changes that alter sleep patterns should be a part of the NP's routine encounter with patients. Referral is indicated for suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome, complex motor activity, or if the condition fails to respond to therapeutic management.",

SI, the cognitive and behavioral correlate of the transition from sleep to wakefulness, has been incorporated in several models of sleep and vigilance regulation. Monitoring of several physiological parameters during the awakening period clearly indicate that this transition process is very slow. On the cognitive and behavioral side, SI has relevant operational implications. SI is one of the most serious contraindications to the use of napping during quasi-continuous operations if the individual may be required to perform complex tasks immediately after sudden awakening at unpredictable times. The studies on SI modulating factors showed that SI is strongly affected by slow wave sleep amount and sleep depth, while the outcomes concerning the modulation of SI by circadian factors are not consistent. Cognitive tasks involving high attentional load seem to be much more affected by SI than simple motor ones, performance accuracy being more impaired than speed. Finally, some possible countermeasures against the detrimental effects of SI to be applied in operational settings have been provided.",

The diagnostic criteria require the history of one or more depressive episodes in the absence of a history of mania. In contrast to adults, youth may experience predominantly irritable rather than sad mood. The assessment of depression should include a psychiatric evaluation, medical history, and focused laboratory studies to rule out medical and/or substance-related causes. The evaluation should also consider potential precipitants such as recent losses, interpersonal problems, or trauma. The patient should be asked directly about suicidal ideation, plans, and past attempts. Psychotherapy alone or in combination with antidepressant therapy is effective for the treatment of pediatric depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are the most well-studied psychotherapies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medication class and should be considered in moderate to severe cases of depression.",

      "abstract": "Over 75% of depressed patients in primary care complain of painful physical symptoms such as headache, stomach pain, neck and back pain aswell as non-specific generalized pain. The presence of such symptoms predicts a greater severity and a less favourable outcome of depression with a poorer health-related quality of life. World Health Organization data obtained in primary care centres worldwide show that 22% of all primary care patients suffer from persistent debilitating pain and that these patients are four times more likely to have co-morbid anxiety or depressive disorder than pain-free primary care patients. Not unexpectedly, the risk of depression is greater when the pain is more diffuse, as indicated by the number of painful sites, and has a greater effect on the quality of life. Certain depressive symptoms, such as low energy and sleep disturbances, are commonly found in patients with co-morbid pain, whereas the opposite is true for symptoms such as guilt and loneliness. Increasingly, major depression is seen as being composed of psychological, somatic and painful physical symptoms. In order to achieve full sustained remission it is necessary to treat symptoms in all three of these areas. The area of painful physical symptoms is unfortunately still poorly understood and clearly merits greater attention. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "title": "Panic disorder",
      "abstract": "Patients with PD experience recurrent episodes of panic, characterised by an intense feeling of impending doom or apprehension. These effects may be accompanied by several physical manifestations of anxiety (see Tab. 5.1). A three-part phenomenological model for PD has been formulated (Klein, 1981). The acute panic attack is the keystone of this model, characterised by sudden and spontaneous, crescendo-like onset of autonomic symptoms and a subjective sense of dread. These attacks last between 10 and 30 min in most instances, and then the patient returns to baseline functioning. The second feature is anticipatory anxiety. The patient begins to worry that an attack will occur again. Rather than returning to baseline after each attack, the patient now exists in a more chronic state of anxiety, always anticipating the onset of an attack. Finally, a subset of patients with PD develops phobic avoidance. In many of these patients, incapacitating agoraphobia supervenes, as they fear leaving the security of home in case a panic attack occurs. The question of whether panic attacks play a fundamental role in the development of agoraphobia remains controversial (Klein et al., 1983; Basoglu et al., 1994). Nevertheless, most patients with agoraphobia had panic attacks before becoming phobic (DeNardo et al., 1983; Noyes et al., 1986; Uhde et al., 1985).",

      "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is frequently associated with a range of sleep disorders, including insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless legs syndrome, and sleep-disordered breathing. RBD is highly prevalent, often occurring early in the disease course and serving as a potential red flag for MSA. Stridor in MSA may cause fatal consequences if not treated properly. Sleep disturbances in MSA likely arise from a complex interplay of factors, including neurodegenerative processes affecting brain regions involved in sleep regulation, iatrogenic effects of medications, and the consequences of motor and autonomic dysfunction. Their consequences on life quality and on life expectancy are important. Sleep recordings should be recommended to all patients with MSA especially when stridor is suspected.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "title": "Secondary headache in emergency",
      "abstract": "Headache is one of the most common causes of access to Emergency Departments (ED). Primary headaches and headaches secondary to benign conditions (e.g headache attributed to acute sinusitis) represent the majority of cases, while secondary life-threatening headaches are less frequent. The primary objective in the ED setting is to decide whether the headache is primary or secondary and recognize serious life-threatening conditions presenting with headache and requiring prompt medical diagnosis and care, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cervical artery dissection (CAD), brain tumors, pituitary apoplexy, spontaneous intracranial hypotension, or intracranial infections. Careful history taking and physical examination remain the most important part of the assessment of the headache patient[1]. A thorough history should investigate the onset of headache, quality, location and irradiation of pain, associated symptoms experienced before and during the headache, concomitant medical conditions, medication use, recent trauma or interventions. The examination should then target areas identified as abnormal during the headache history; funduscopy evaluation should be performed when symptoms may suggest an increased intracranial pressure; in addition, a complete neurological assessment including level of consciousness, cranial nerve testing, pupillary responses, motor strength and sensorial testing, and signs of meningeal irritation is essential[2]. Based on historical and physical findings “red flags” for secondary headache disorders are sudden onset, onset after 50 years of age, increased frequency, severity or significant change in the usual headache pattern, new onset with an underlying medical condition (such as cancer or immunodepression), concomitant signs of systemic illness (such as fever, neck stiffness, rash), focal neurologic signs or symptoms, papilledema, and head trauma[2]. In headache patients with one or more “red flags” a diagnostic workup is indicated including blood tests, neuroimaging studies, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. Blood testing and dosage of inflammation indexes (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) should be performed in all headache patients especially when an infective or inflammatory condition is suspected. In the ED, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging study and is used to rule out hemorrhage, while most patients should perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan followed by CT/MRI angiography if brain vessel disease is suspected (such as, CAD, aneurysms, and CVST). Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis may help to diagnose SAH, infection, tumor and disorders related to CSF hypertension or hypotension[3, 4]. Treatment and prognosis depend on the etiology of the headache. Prompt recognition and early treatment of secondary headache are essential to avoid some preventable complications.",

Sleep is an important part of physiologic, emotional, and neurocognitive development. Sleep in children is an important and dynamic process, affecting numerous aspects of health and development. Problems with sleep are relatively common but often can be challenging to recognize and hence are very often missed. At every general checkup, parents should be asked whether they have any sleep concerns, whether their child snores, and whether their child wakes up appearing rested. A few key interventions (especially sleep hygiene) can effectively be implemented in general pediatric practice, and more complex issues should be referred to a sleep specialist. Thus, the aim of this article is to sensitize the practitioner in sleep medicine and provide an overview of sleep in children, including important aspects of sleep-related physiology, key relationships between sleep and growth and development, and the most prevalent sleep disorders that pediatricians are likely to encounter.",

      "abstract": "L'etude de l'etat de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) amene a se poser deux types de questions fondamentales : 1) pourquoi certains individus exposes a un evenement traumatique developpent le trouble alors que d'autres non? et 2) parmi ceux qui developpent le trouble, pourquoi la majorite des individus entrent en remission apres quelques mois alors que d'autres developpent un ESPT chronique qui persiste pendant plusieurs mois, voire plusieurs annees? La presente these avait donc pour but de trouver certaines explications a cette deuxieme question qui semble plus importante d'un point de vue clinique en raison des repercussions que ce trouble peut avoir sur le fonctionnement quotidien des victimes et de leur entourage. Effectivement, pour certaines victimes, plus le temps passe, plus les symptomes s'installent et se cristallisent. Pour ces individus, les symptomes chroniques et dommageables seraient souvent jumeles a differentes complications, notamment un trouble depressif ou anxieux, un trouble de dependance ou d'abus de substances, un changement au niveau de la personnalite, ainsi qu'a une degradation durable au plan du fonctionnement social et professionnel (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). Il a ete propose que le processus de remission ne requiert pas un oubli, mais reflete plutot un nouvel apprentissage (Foa, 2000) et que les dysfonctions mnesiques (souvenirs recurrents et involontaires du trauma et difficultes a se souvenirs du trauma) observees chez les victimes d'evenements traumatiques pourraient interferer avec la remission du trauma, un processus d'adaptation qui requiert ce nouvel apprentissage par extinction (Shalev, 2000). La these se compose de quatre chapitres. Le premier consiste en une description des modeles theoriques et neuronaux ainsi qu'une recension de la litterature sur les processus mnesiques impliques dans l'ESPT ainsi que les facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux dysfonctions mnesiques retrouvees dans l'ESPT. Cette recension met en evidence la controverse dans la litterature en ce qui a trait a la memoire traumatique ainsi que les principales failles methodologiques qui empechent de repondre au questionnement souleve. Le deuxieme chapitre presente une etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des experiences emotionnelles peritraumatiques (detresse et dissociation vecues au moment du trauma) chez des individus exposes a un evenement traumatique en fonction de leur statut diagnostic. Il etait anticipe qu'en appliquant la theorie d'une relation en « U » inversee entre l'intensite du stress et le systeme mnesique hippocampique (Metcalfe & Jacobs, 1998) et en tenant compte du statut diagnostique, nous pourrions mieux comprendre les resultats contradictoires obtenus jusqu'a maintenant au sujet des souvenirs traumatiques. Les resultats de cette etude ont demontre que le statut diagnostique est associe a la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des reponses peritraumatiques. Ces resultats sont donc en accord avec la theorie de Metcalfe & Jacob (1998) sur la memoire traumatique humaine qui suggere qu'un niveau de stress modere produit un souvenir forme a l'aide de l'hippocampe et est associe avec la memoire episodique, autobiographique et contextuelle, alors qu'un niveau de stress extreme mene a un encodage independant de l'hippocampe, mais associe a l'activation de l'amygdale, menant a la creation d'un souvenir decontextualise, sensoriel et charge emotionnellement. Le troisieme chapitre presente une deuxieme etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, le role des facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux fonctions mnesiques dans l'evolution des symptomes d'ESPT en etudiant l'implication de certains SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism) du gene FKBP5 dans le processus de remission du trouble. Les resultats ont demontre que le gene FKBP5 pouvait prospectivement predire le manque d'amelioration des symptomes d'ESPT chez des individus ayant recours a une therapie pour un ESPT aigu. Des analyses plus specifiques ont aussi demontre un effet interactif des SNPs du gene FKBP5 et du souvenir subjectif de la severite du trauma (c.-a-d., les reponses peritraumatiques) sur les dysfonctions mnesiques. Les resultats demontrent donc une relation entre les corticosteroides et les performances mnesiques, ce qui pourrait interferer avec l'apprentissage par extinction, et par consequent, en partie expliquer la persistance du trouble. Le dernier chapitre propose une discussion generale des resultats qui permettent de constater que les processus mnesiques sont impliques dans la remission/persistance de l'ESPT. Les differentes forces et limites ainsi que les implications cliniques et theoriques de la presente these sont aussi examinees.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________",

In ranking among the cause of disability it has been ranked as major leading cause for disability in worldwide. (1) Major depressive disorder is debilitating disease and has and at least one individual depressive episode for minimum of two weeks and involves changed mood, decreased interest in surrounding and decreased pleasure specifically in activities which were earlier pleasurable along with changes in cognitive function and changes in vegetative symptoms (2) . few of these patient might report guilt feelings and feelings of worthlessness or feeling of hopelessness, also patient reports of repetitive negative thoughts about individual self and their future (3) . Taking consideration prevalence and the suffering, morbidity, dysfunction, and economic burden depression is major public health concern disorder. Depression being more common in women than men, report on global burden of disease suggests the point prevalence of unipolar depressive episodes is 1.9% for men and 3.2% for women, while the estimated one year prevalence to be 5.8% for men and 9.5% for women. Study says that if current trends for demographic and epidemiologic transitions continue by the year 2020, the burden of disease might increase up to 5.7% of total burden of the disease making it second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second to ischemic heart disease. (4) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for treating MDD because of their superior tolerability and safety profiles relative to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. (6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention. (7) Thus in this study we attempt to examine the better treatment amongst two groups that can help to treat our patients and improve clinical outcome.",

Syncopal and psychomotor attacks may overlap in the following context: falls resembling syncope during psychomotor seizures, the so-called \"temporal fainting spells\"; cardiac arrhythmias during psychomotor attacks; psychomotor symptoms such as automatisms and/or \"dreamy states\" that occur during syncopal attacks with transient dysfunction of the limbic system; alternating psychomotor and syncopal attacks in the same patient Symptoms of intermittent vertebrobasilar insufficiency: non-systematic vertigo, brief blurring of consciousness and blackouts may all be misinterpreted as rudimentary psychomotor seizures.

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>There is a growing interest in personalized and preventive medicine initiatives that leverage serious patient engagement, such as those initiated and pursued among participants in the quantified-self movement. However, many of the self-assessments that result are not rooted in good scientific practices, such as exploiting controls, dose escalation strategies, multiple endpoint monitoring, etc. Areas where individual monitoring and health assessments have great potential involve sleep and behavior, as there are a number of very problematic sleep and behavior-related conditions that are hard to treat without personalization. For example, winter depression or seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a serious, recurrent, atypical depressive disorder impacting millions each year. In order to prevent yearly recurrence antidepressant drugs are used to prophylactically treat SAD. In turn, these antidepressant drugs can affect sleep patterns, further exacerbating the condition. Because of this, possibly unique combinatorial or ‘polypharmaceutical’ interventions involving sleep aids may be prescribed. However, little research into the effects of such polypharmacy on the long-term sleep quality of treated individuals has been pursued. Employing wireless monitoring in a patient-centered study we sought to gain insight into the influence of polypharmacy on sleep patterns and the optimal course of therapy for an individual being treated for SAD with duloxetine (Cymbalta) and temazepam. We analyzed continuous-time sleep data while dosages and combinations of these agents were varied. We found that the administration of Cymbalta led to an exacerbation of the subject’s symptoms in a statistically significant way. Further, we unmasked and monitored treatment effects on a latent obstructive sleep apnea condition. We argue that such analyses may be necessary to effectively treat individuals with similar overall clinical manifestations and diagnosis, despite their having a unique set of symptoms, genetic profiles and exposure histories. We also consider the limitations of our study and areas for further research.</ns4:p>",

Systemic hypertension and most of the severe arrhythmias recorded during sleep were secondary to repetitive obstructive apnonea and were mediated through the autonomic nervous system. Sleep related elevations of pulmonary arterial pressure were not influenced by atropine or impaired autonomic functions. Upper airway sleep apnoea is sleep related; the type of sleep (REM or NREM) is critical in the appearance of abnormalities. The distinction between two patient subgroups (total sleep dependent and NREM sleep dependent) has haemodynamic, and possibly long-term, implications.

This review will illustrate the role of sleep problems in traumatized children and adolescents, and emphasize the need to consider a wide range of etiological mechanisms for these symptoms. However, the relationship of trauma exposure to sleep problems among children and adolescents needs further investigation in future research.

A detailed history and physical examination, along with polysomnography and video electroencephalography findings can lead to the correct diagnosis. Abstract Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by recurrent episodes of the upper airway complete or partial collapse while sleeping. The obstructive episodes result in gradual suffocation that increases breathing attempts till the person is awakened. The main manifestations are excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, observed episodes of stopped breathing, and abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking. Nevertheless, there are very few reports of patients with OSA, manifesting other symptoms such as seizure‐like movements. Differentiating OSA with nocturnal seizures could be challenging due to their overlapping features. A 53‐year‐old man presented to the clinic, experiencing seizure‐like involuntary movements during nocturnal sleep for the past 2 years with a frequency of 2–3 times per night. Neurologic examinations were normal. Further evaluation with polysomnography revealed impaired arousal followed by seizure‐like movements during sleep. Video electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges, ruling out the nocturnal seizure diagnosis. The patient was diagnosed with OSA. Subsequently, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment resolved all symptoms.",

Due to its high prevalence, insomnia frequently co-exists with various somatic and psychiatric disorders, exhibiting a bidirectional relationship in which each condition influences the other. Depression, anxiety, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancies can serve as factors triggering insomnia complaints, according to the behavioral model for insomnia development. Moreover, chronic insomnia increases the risk of these diseases through several pathogenic mechanisms, including activated stress response, altered neurotransmitter signaling, and impaired emotion regulation. This interplay creates a vicious cycle of poor sleep, deteriorated health, and impaired quality of life. Recognizing the relationship between insomnia and overall well-being is essential for adopting optimal treatment methodology, as addressing insomnia can ameliorate associated mental and physical health issues. This review explores the bidirectional association of chronic insomnia with other somatic and mental diseases, illustrating how each can aggravate the other, and emphasizes the importance of effective insomnia management in improving overall health and quality of life.",

Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta.

It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

Further, while REM behavior disorder is more common in men, it is not rare in women and needs to be considered in cases of sleep-related injury. It is important to recognize the unique features of the various parasomnias and their relationships to neuropsychiatric disease. Finally, these conditions are reversible with the proper identification and treatment of underlying comorbid sleep disorders, the discontinuation of inducing agents, as well as the judicious use of pharmacotherapy and environmental modification.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD) and episodic nocturnal wanderings (ENWs) are complex motor attacks arising abruptly during sleep, especially nonrapid eye movement sleep. NPD is characterized by sudden arousal followed by motor agitation with dystonic posturing, and semipurposeful activity recurring several times per night. When short-lasting, NPD may respond favorably to carbamazepine. ENWs are unusual episodes of ambulation, with unintelligible speech, screaming, and complex, often violent, behavior that responds to anticonvulsants. In both short-lasting NPD and ENWs, electroencephalography may show some evidence of epilepsy; NPD is clinically similar to the frontal lobe seizures that arise mesially or in depth. Paroxysmal arousals (PAs) are even shorter episodes of arousal or awakening during nonrapid eye movement sleep, associated with transient dystonic posturing and related to the short-lasting NPD. PAs, short-lasting NPD, and ENWs probably represent a spectrum of peculiar sleep-related epileptic seizures.",

The\r\n traumatic event for every man is sudden, unexpected, embarrassing, and in such events the\r\n person is never ready. Every hour, someone becomes a victim of violence, a victim of a\r\n psychological trauma, either directly or as a witness. Consequences such as sexual and / or\r\n psychological abuse, participation in war operations, murders, heavy traffic accidents, natural\r\n disasters, sudden deaths of close relatives can be expressed immediately or developed into\r\n posttraumatic stress disorder. If he is a victim, he certainly wants to know what exactly happened\r\n to be able to take healing, recovery and return to normal life circumstances.\r\n Traumatic experience leaves a lasting mental, emotional, behavioral and physical\r\n consequence that the traumatized person wears on a daily basis. The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help. Successful treatment is very important for\r\n good communication that needs to be established with the patient and that his family is involved\r\n with the patient as well, because it should be the greatest support and support, and this can\r\n greatly affect the course and outcome of the treatment. The first contact of the patient and his\r\n family with the doctor is through a medical interview, and by the arrival of the patient in the\r\n institution and the search for professional help, the health care service begins to be provided on\r\n an individual level for each patient in a holistic approach involving the entire health care team\r\n employees.\r\n Social awareness of human rights, violence and disasters has increased over the last 20 years,\r\n which has contributed to wars and natural disasters, which has led to the development of\r\n psychotraumatology. In Croatia, the area of psychotraumatology began to develop more\r\n intensively at the beginning of the 90s of the last century or during the Homeland War.",

However, early rehabilitation does not seem to resolve all the problems. Social losses and social deterioration are found in more than half of schizophrenic patients already in prodrome phase i.e. before the onset of the first psychotic episode. Further on, every relapse, several months of disease and hospitalizations frequently disrupt education, cause losing jobs and breaking relations, social withdrawal and also disability. Environmental and social factors may facilitate the development of chronic conditions and increasing defect via their interaction with the personality and the disease. Not infrequently the rehabilitation process may lag behind and certain possibilities may be missed. There is also a gap between the rehabilitation concepts and sociopsychological characteristics of specific age groups of psychiatric patients. The author presents the concept of psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) using schizophrenic patients as an example and emphasizes the following aspects: 1) PSR in an essential component of care on every stage that follows treatment, throughout the whole course of disease; 2) psychosocial interventions and social support are aimed at both preserving social capacities of the patient and prevention of social losses in future; 3) complex therapy in combination with consequent psychosocial (both group and individual) patient-centered interventions involving also family and social network of the patient is used along with other methods of social recovery; 4) with regard for the mentioned one can distinguish the most problematic patients groups, specifically: a) those in initial phase of disease (first 5 years), b) patients with frequent hospitalizations, c) those with unstable labor adjustment, d) single persons, e) those staying in hospital too long; and 5) in adolescence and in young age the purpose of rehabilitation is not only winning back the social positions but also restoration of the patient's personality and his social self; while in older age coping with negative effects of getting older and acceptation of new social roles are becoming more important.",

      "title": "Factors Affecting Sleep and Wakefulness in People with Epilepsy: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

The second type of request is for assessment of psychiatric symptoms in the context of a known neurological disorder. The third type of request is when patients develop prominent psychiatric symptoms but there is concern that these are the product of an underlying neurological process. Psychiatric symptoms are also very common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and take the form of depression, agitation, anxiety and irritability.

      "abstract": "Knowledge regarding the etiology and optimal management of prolonged infantile apnea and its relationship to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is tentative. Consequently, infantile apnea is a controversial subject; professional discussion and media attention are often emotional and even erroneous. Prolonged apnea is defined as cessation of breathing for at least 20 seconds or as a briefer episode of apnea associated with bradycardia, cyanosis, or pallor. Brief episodes of apnea are a normal occurrence in infants, but prolonged apneic episodes may lead to morbidity and rarely mortality. The vast majority of infants with prolonged apnea are not victims of SIDS; most SIDS victims were never observed to have had prolonged apnea prior to the terminal event. The risk of death from SIDS is somewhat greater in the group of infants with prolonged apnea than in the general population. Infants with sleep apnea who have required active intervention, such as positive pressure \"resuscitation,\" may be at significant risk. Apnea of undetermined etiology that occurs in the premature infant between the actual date of birth and the original due date is apparently not predictive of SIDS. There is, however, indication that preterm infants as a group and perhaps siblings of infants who were victims of SIDS are at somewhat increased risk. Infants who have had an episode of prolonged apnea are perceived by parents and physicians as having experienced a life-threatening event and being at risk for another. Prolonged apnea can be a symptom of many disorders including infection, seizures, airway abnormalities, hypoglycemia or other metabolic problems, anemia (in preterm infants), gastroesophageal reflux, impaired regulation of breathing during sleeping and feeding, and abuse.",

Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Recognition of Long Covid is increasing. In a recent meta-analysis in youth with Long Covid, the most prevalent clinical symptoms were mood (16.50%), fatigue (9.66%), and sleep disorders (8.42%). However, there is a paucity of data in the management of these symptoms. Report of case(s) We present a case of severe hypersomnolence after a mild Covid-19 infection in a 13 year-old female with no significant history, an acceptable age-appropriate sleep-wake schedule without nighttime awakenings or sleepiness prior to infection. Post-infection, she developed a one year history of sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, significant circadian delays, sleep inertia, brain fog and headaches. She was referred to sleep medicine and responded to treatment for a circadian rhythm disorder with sleep-wake restructuring, melatonin, and strict sleep hygiene. Sleep fragmentation, unrefreshing sleep, and hypersomnolence persisted; ESS=15/24. Sleep duration was often ≥12 hours in a 24 hour period. The patient could not wake easily, and often missed school or left early for sleepiness and headaches. A trial of gabapentin 200mg at bedtime failed. Sleep diagnostics were performed. Polysomnography showed no sleep disruptors, 8 hours of sleep, and some delayed slow wave sleep periods. Mean sleep latency testing (MSLT) showed MSL of 15.4min; 1 SOREM (nap #1). With a working diagnosis of hypersomnia due to medical condition vs. idiopathic hypersomnia, methylphenidate up to 36mg ER was trialed with some improvement. A recent adult case with Long Covid and ADHD-like syndrome also responded to stimulant use, though no guidelines are established for Long Covid. Oxybate was later added up to 2g once nightly which helped resolve sleep inertia, improve sleep quality and reduce sleepiness(ESS=4/24). She was able to return to school full time and reached normal functioning. Conclusion While the pathophysiology of Long Covid is still under investigation, symptom management of sleepiness can impact functioning. This case demonstrates a successful treatment of a patient with Long Covid and hypersomnolence with resolution of excessive sleepiness, morning inertia, and sleep fragmentation with a treatment approach similar to that of idiopathic hypersomnia, using an oxybate along with daytime stimulant use.

It involves a fluctuating cognitive impairment with reduced alertness and often with poorly formed delusions and/or visual hallucinations. The main differential diagnosis is from dementia, although delirium is more likely to develop in patients with existing dementia. Almost any medical condition that affects brain function may cause delirium. Infection is the most common cause, and it is important to consider prescribed drugs as a cause and to remember drug and alcohol withdrawal. Imperatives in management are first to keep the patient safe from harm (they may wander or put themselves in danger), and second to find and correct the cause. Urgent medical investigation and treatment is required as long periods of delirium put the patient at risk of harm, including permanent cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a severe and a complicated mental disorder that affects the overall well-being of an individual through alterations in thought and perceptions wherein the person losses touch with reality. The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The two main phases of sleep are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. REM sleep is often called dreaming (or D) sleep, because dreams are reported by about 70–80% of persons awakened during this period. REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration). Brain metabolism is normal or slightly increased during REM sleep.",

Dizziness is often used as a non-specific term to describe many sensations, including vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium and lightheadedness. In another sense, dizziness can be described more specifically as a feeling of unsteadiness or a mild intoxication, or as if the ground is rocking, or the affected person has to take side-steps to keep balance. Vertigo, by comparison, is often described as a feeling of rotation; the room or surroundings are spinning around like a carousel. Presyncope is often described as sensation of impending fainting or sense of falling. Lightheadedness is a much more vague description of dizziness, difficult to define. Disequilibrium, on the other hand, can be described almost in the same terms as dizziness: a feeling of unsteadiness or loss of balance.",

      "title": "S112. ELUCIDATING THE CHRONOLOGY OF FLUCTUATIONS IN BASIC SYMPTOMS, EARLY SIGNS AND PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS IN ESTABLISHED PSYCHOSIS USING REPEATED MEASURES DATA GATHERED USING A SMARTPHONE APP",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Psychosis relapses are common, have profound adverse consequences for patients, and are costly to health services. ‘Early signs’ (e.g. anxiety; insomnia) have been used to predict relapse, in the hope of prevention or mitigation, with moderate sensitivity and specificity. Recent studies have provided preliminary prospective evidence that assessing ‘basic symptoms’ (e.g. vivid colour vision; disturbances in expressive speech) in addition to conventional early signs improves relapse prediction. Basic symptoms are assumed to be one of the earliest, most basic subjective expressions of the underlying neurobiological disruption preceding the development of psychosis. There is some empirical evidence from ultra-high risk groups suggesting that basic symptoms do indeed emerge prior to other risk indicators during the prodromal period. However, no studies to date have examined the relative timing of increases in basic symptoms, conventional early signs and psychotic symptoms in individuals with established psychosis. In the current study, we used time-lagged, repeated measures, prospective data to test whether increased basic symptoms would precede increased conventional early signs, and in turn increased psychotic symptoms. Methods Individuals who had experienced a relapse of psychosis within the past year (n=18) were asked to use a smartphone app (‘ExPRESS’) weekly for six months to report early signs, basic symptoms and psychotic symptoms. Participants completed 65% of app assessments over the 6 month follow-up period, providing &amp;gt;200 observations in total. These data were analyzed using mixed effects models to account for clustering within individuals and to allow for missing data. Results App items showed high concurrent validity with researcher-rated psychotic symptoms (ρ range 0.80 to 0.87, p&amp;lt;0.001) and basic symptoms (ICC=0.76, p&amp;lt;0.001) over six months. The results of the mixed effects analyses described above will be presented in full, and their theoretical and clinical implications will be discussed. Discussion We anticipate that the findings of this study will be of theoretical interest. Within the socio-developmental-cognitive model (Howes &amp; Murray, 2014), it would be logical to equate basic symptoms with the initial ‘anomalous experiences’ that are proposed to occur as a result of a disrupted dopamine system. Conventional early signs may then either occur later in the deterioration process laid out in the model or, as a heterogeneous group, may relate to more than one stage of the process. The results of the current study may help to elucidate the place of basic symptoms and conventional early signs within the socio-developmental-cognitive model. The findings may also lend support to the idea that basic symptoms are dopaminergic in origin.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a reversible state of disconnection from the environment, including reduced consciousness, skeletal muscle mobility, and metabolism. All forms of sensory responses are markedly decreased to varying degrees depending on the sleep cycle stage. Although this phenomenon is observed in all species that have been studied and occupies a significant fraction of the human lifespan, the purpose and function of sleep remain poorly understood.Sleep is measured primarily by polysomnography (PSG) which is considered the gold standard for diagnosing sleep disorders.. PSG reveals that sleep architecture has several distinct stages that vacillate between the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages and rapid eye movement (REM) stages. The REM stage is of particular interest due to its association with various pathological, psychological, and physiological phenomena. The wide variety of medical and psychiatric pathologies, as well as common pharmacotherapies that can disrupt normal sleep, are summarized in this article. With more than 50 million Americans affected by sleep loss, the treatment of sleep disorders is becoming an increasingly more specialized and interprofessional field with a significant impact on patient health in both acute and chronic settings.",

Stroke patients frequently represent mood disturbances, cognitive decline, anxiety disorders, and sometimes serious schizophorm or paranoid states. Poststroke depression is the most common and possibly amenable form to therapeutic intervention. Depressive symptoms have negative effect on the rehabilitation process, quality of life and even on long-term survival. Considering drug therapy, in the past decade tricyclic drugs have been replaced by newly developed antidepressants with milder side-effects profile. Our knowledge on the relationship among vascular and other types of dementia has been extended in the recent years. This development also has some therapeutic implications. It seems likely that other psychiatric disorders, psychoses, pathological affect and personality disorders also inhibit recovery and limit long-term quality of life, but available data on this topic is limited.",

      "title": "Crying Behaviour and Its Importance for Psychosocial Development in Children",
      "abstract": "Introduction For generations, parents have experienced the stress and frustration of increased, inconsolable crying in their infants in the first three to five months of life. In its most extreme manifestations, this increased crying has been considered a clinical problem, often referred to as “colic.” The most extreme and dangerous consequence for the infant is abuse or neglect, and especially the specific form of abuse referred to as “shaken baby syndrome.” Many of the properties of crying are unique to the first few months, and therefore generate their own particular problems. Later in the first year of life, the amount of crying is much reduced. However, more stable individual differences between infants appear. Those infants who tend to be more reactive and to respond negatively (by crying) can be completely normal, but they are often thought of clinically as having a “difficult temperament.” If the crying is associated with difficulties feeding and sleeping, they are often thought of in clinical terms as having behavioural regulation problems (“regulatory disorder”). While the vast majority of these crying behaviours are not associated with disease or pathology, the meaning of the crying behaviour for the infants’ caregivers (“perceptual set”) is usually a determinant of its psychosocial consequences for the infant. Although many questions remain, research findings have changed our understanding of the nature and significance of this early behaviour.",

The deleterious effects of chronic intermittent hypoxemia and fragmentation and/or sleep deprivation are demonstrated. Overweight is frequently the common and proven denominator to these pathologies. These disorders can lead to events related to the sympathetic stimulation and hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines.

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

The perception that a problem constitutes an emergency is often subjective and sometimes reflects the anxieties of others rather than a real need for urgent treatment. Keeping calm and unhurried in front of an agitated patient might be as important as the use of a neuroleptic. The rather unusual psychopathological phenomena catalepsy and psychogenic twilight state (psychogenic trance) are mentioned in view of their importance for urgent assessment of mental status. The scope of the problem of suicide is outlined as far as the general physician is involved. Special attention is paid to panic disorder and attacks, a relatively new concept in medicine. Since the symptoms mimic those of cardiac, endocrine and convulsive disorders, patients with such symptoms often come to the attention of general physicians and frequently use the services of emergency departments. Early identification and treatment of panic disorder might help to avoid unnecessary repeated emergency department visits, and at the same time reduce the associated high risk of suicide and other psychiatric disorders such as depression as well as drug and alcohol abuse.",
