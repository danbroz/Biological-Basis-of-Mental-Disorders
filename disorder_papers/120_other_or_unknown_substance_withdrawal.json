When the substances are stopped, the symptoms get better or go away altogether. SUDs include disorders related to use of alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics, stimulants, tobacco, and other (or unknown) substances. Eleven criteria are listed for diagnosis of an SUD. Statistics on SUDs in the United States are given. Advice is offered for family members and significant others who have a loved one with an SUD.",

      "abstract": "The word \"drug\" in accordance with the definition given by the WHO means \"any substance that, when taken into the living organisms, may modify one or more of its functions\". This thus covers a wider field than the word \"medicine\" or \"medicament\". There are many substances which are capable of provoking anxiety and are very frequently consumed. According to recent publications the use and abuse of alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, marihuana, and drugs such as sedatives (neuroleptics), caffeine, minor tranquilisers and other may provoke acute and chronic anxiety and depression. When confronted with anxiety states or depressive states, it is absolutely essential not to overlook the possibility that they may have been induced by a medicament or a drug which the patient has been using.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "약물(마약류) 등의 남용에 따른 폐해와 그 대책",
      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

In caffeine intoxication, these symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are not due to a general medical condition or better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety disorder). Nicotine is highly lipid‐soluble and rapidly enters the brain after inhalation. Nicotine receptors are found on dopaminergic cell bodies and stimulation of these receptors leads to dopamine release. Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

A two-compartment model consisting of and dependence was used to clarify clinical features of dependence. was defined by drug liking. Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "title": "Late Onset Depression",
      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

There are many reasons behind a man gets addicted to these substances such as recreation purpose, drugs used for long time for treatment of any disorder and gets addicted, unemployment, stress, emotions, professional pressure and social status. It provides enjoyable feelings which results in creating a strong urge to use the substances again and again. These drugs can cause physical dependence or psychological dependence or both. Over time, drug tolerance is produced which means to get the same effect more quantity of the drug is needed. These substances are very harmful physically, mentally, financially and socially too. If someone suddenly terminates using these substances after heavy or long term use, the body needs time to recover and number of withdrawal symptoms arises. These withdrawal symptoms can’t be treated by medications only but it needs counselling and support as well.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Agents capable of precipitating dissociative-like states include alcohol, barbiturates and similarly acting hypnotics, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, clioquinol, β-adrenergic blockers, marijuana and certain psychedelic drugs, general anesthetics, and others. The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

The specific factors of substance use disorder consist of abuse, intoxication, and physical/psychological dependence. Different substances can be classified based on their effects on the central nervous system. These effects vary depending on the substance and can produce everything from increased energy and euphoria to profound sedation. In general, while the effects vary significantly, the initial stages of substance use disorders are characterized by positive reinforcement, where individuals experience a sense of well-being or euphoria with use. As physiological and psychological dependence progresses, an individual experiences negative reinforcement where substances primarily relieve dysphoria and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

Substance abuse also refers to their use in order to increase intellectual or physical performance, against the rules established by society. Substance abuse involves the chronic use of non-medical chemicals for hedonistic or entheogenic purposes [1]. Drugs such as alcohol, antidepressants, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, glue, cocaine, hallucinogens, metacular, narcotics, opiates, sedatives, stimulants and some organic solvents can be named [2]. Substance abuse can cause criminal or antisocial behavior, may generate long-term changes in personality [3]. Cocaine has major toxic effects on the body. Treatment of cocaine poisoning is complex. The main sales are those that can lead to patient death. For the proper treatment of any inoculation, it is necessary to identify the xenobiotic that generated it. The presence of metabolites, in the case of cocaine - ethylbenzoylcogene (EBE), provides information on the time of administration of the xenobiotic. Gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is an optoelectronic method that can identify the presence of cocaine and / or EBE from biological samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, a special mass metrology technique - MS/MS can be used [4, 5].",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "title": "PV-121 - ASOCIACIÓN ENTRE CONSUMO DE 2C (TUSI) Y CONDUCTA SUICIDA. A PROPÓSITO DE UN CASO.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Establishment of residual cognitive and psychotic effects (effects present at the time that all active cannabinoids are eliminated from the body) putatively produced by prolonged heavy cannabis use is difficult, because of many confounding variables like slow elimination of active cannabinoids, lack of supervision during abstinence, poor use of well-matched control groups and the presence of withdrawal symptoms. Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

These include phenylethylamines (e.g., ecstasy), ergot alkaloids (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD), tryptamines (e.g., psilocybin), anticholinergics (e.g., jimsonweed), and terpenoids (e.g., salvinorin). Dissociative anesthetics—including phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine—are a related class of drugs that share many characteristics. Hallucinogen use is highest among young adults; MDMA is the most commonly used agent, followed by LSD and PCP. There appear to be few serious lasting complications associated with hallucinogen use.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

      "abstract": "The network therapy approach can be useful in addressing a broad range of patients with addictions characterized by the following clinical hallmarks of substance use disorder: First, when they initiate consumption of their addictive agent, be it alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or depressant drugs, they frequently cannot limit that consumption to a reasonable and predictable level; this phenomenon has been termed \"loss of control\" by clinicians who treat persons dependent on alcohol or drugs. Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness.

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example, Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class, which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine. A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the present book, fifteen typical literatures about drug addiction published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on human health, illegal drugs, neuroscience, psychology, ect. We hope this book can demonstrate advances in drug addiction as well as give references to the researchers, students and other related people.",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "title": "Alcohol Abuse",
      "abstract": "IntroductionAlcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

A simplified interpretation of this definition is presented in Figure 91.1. Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan.

A case of catatonia is reported which occurred after alcohol withdrawal.Catatonia occurred 48 hours after alcohol withdrawal in a 54-year-old woman who had stopped all her treatment (in the context of a type II bipolar disorder). A dramatic improvement of symptoms was observed after oral administration of zolpidem.This case seems to confirm that catatonia can represents a nonspecific response to stress factors. The withdrawal of multiple medications was already described as a basis for catatonia. Alcohol withdrawal could constitute an additional risk factor for catatonia.

      "title": "Food Addiction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction is a topic that has received attention in the psychological literature in part because of the role that it potentially plays in binge eating, obesity, and eating disorders. Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal are similar to those of other drug withdrawal syndromes: anxiety, awakening during sleep, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, irritability/anger and restlessness. Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "abstract": "El trastorno por consumo de alcohol consiste en un patrón desadaptativo de consumo de la sustancia que conlleva un deterioro o malestar clínicamente significativo, un período continuado de 12 meses. Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

Among the most frequent reasons of insomnia one can mention the overuse of coffee, alcohol, smoking, using some drugs, stress, depression, neurosis, dementia, chronic diseases. Idiopathic insomnia constitutes less than 5% of cases. Before the treatment of insomnia is started, its cause should be found and it should be determined if it is transient or chronic. The treatment of insomnia can be based on pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy methods. Behavioural therapy is mentioned among non-pharmacotherapeutic methods. It aims at changing the sleep-related habits. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment (still mostly based on benzodiazepines) should not last longer than 2-3 weeks and drugs of short elimination T 1/2 (below 6 hours) should be used. Side-effects of this group of drugs should always be taken into consideration. It should be remembered that sleep disturbances can be symptoms of other diseases and their treatment cannot consist in prescribing hypnotics only.",

Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders. Some substances that have historically been used recreationally are being studied as possible treatments for mood disorders.",

Other psychiatric conditions (particularly anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder) often coexist with eating disorders, and this may in part explain the benefit sometimes seen with medication.

When a person starts using drugs, it starts getting addicted to them and gradually it can’t help but act on the impulse to use them regardless of the damage caused to the body of addicted person. Drug isn’t about just illegal drugs. A person can get addicted to alcohol, painkillers, nicotine and other legal substances. Drug addiction is a deathly disease found in almost every year of age. The disease is mostly carried by people who are mentally frustrated, physically or mentally abused, facing financial problem or family problems and is desperate to get some sort of relief that comes with the high of drugs even if it proves to be grim for their health in the long run. Addiction starts with the continuous use of dosage of any drug, until the point that an individual starts feeling anxious without the availability of them. Slowly and painfully, these drugs starts making a person totally relied on them and it is basically impossible for the individual to survive without them. There can be many reasons as to why an individual decides to go on this path of addiction. Economic problems, state of utter sadness in case of the death of a loved one or a closed one, societal stress, isolation, aggression, bad or wrong company, in state of depression and anxiety are the most likely situations in which a person starts taking drugs. Along with many other factors, families often play a vital role in pushing an individual towards seeking comfort and relief from the drugs. Developing countries like Pakistan and many others are facing the problem as there are not many effective and active rehabilitation centers. In this research article, the role of families contributing in an individual’s drug addiction is elaborated. This research article is done with the help of many researches, as well as some interviews were conducted regarding certain factors and the answers were given according to the observation and views of responders. The conclusion is drawn with the help of articles and personal opinions and observations regarding how a person leans toward substance or drug usage because of certain family issues and problems.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in knowledge about cannabinoid receptor function have renewed interest in the association between cannabis and psychosis. Converging lines of evidence suggest that cannabinoids can produce a full range of transient schizophrenia-like positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Cannabinoids also produce some psychophysiological deficits also known to be present in schizophrenia. Also clear is that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. Increasing evidence suggests that early and heavy cannabis exposure may increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. The relationship between cannabis exposure and schizophrenia fulfills some, but not all, of the usual criteria for causality. However, most people who use cannabis do not develop schizophrenia, and many people diagnosed with schizophrenia have never used cannabis. Therefore, it is likely that cannabis exposure is a \"component cause\" that interacts with other factors to \"cause\" schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to do so alone. In the absence of known causes of schizophrenia, however, and the implications for public health policy should such a link be established the role of component causes such as cannabinoid exposure should remain a focus of further study. Finally, further work is necessary to identify the factors that underlie individual vulnerability to cannabinoid-related psychosis and to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying this risk.",

Abusive drinking is any use of alcoholic beverages that contributes to the development of a physical illness, a mental or emotional disorder, or the destabilization of an economic or social relationship that would not have otherwise been destabilized. This broad definition of alcohol abuse is employed because no single definition of alcoholism can adequately describe the variety of behaviors and clinical symptoms encountered when one studies or treats Navajos whose lives have been changed by frequent or poorly timed intoxication. When providing services to Navajos who suffer from alcohol abuse, this broad definition of 'alcohol abuse provides more insight into the manner in which intoxication contributes to the patient's maladaptation than any of the more strictly defined constructs, be they medical, psychological, or traditional",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population. Gastric acid blockers, benzodiazepines, some antidepressants and opioid analgetics have been described in the review.",

A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved. In the research the academically definitions and the clinical case descriptions of the following clinical phenomena were estimated: Conversion, obsession, neurasthenia, phobia, derealisation/depersonalization, anxiety (partly specific for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders); True hallucinations, confusion, amnesia, fixation hypomnesia, anecphoria (partly specific for organic mental disorders); Pseudo hallucinations, delusion of control, automatism, paralogia, emotional withdrawal, autism, ambivalence (common symptoms of schizophrenia); Inability to feel, sadness, lassitude, euphoria, excitement as the signs of endogenous affective disorders. Mainly non-specific phenomenon - persecutory delusions. Thus were obtained 14 estimates for each item on a 100-point scale. Dispersion of majority ranges was too high to get significant differences. But 6 from 7 experts significantly (p<0.05) and 1 tendentionally (p<0.01) rated 3 symptoms (autism, conversion and paralogia) as relatively more complex as compared with 7 more simplex phenomena (anxiety, confusion, euphoria, excitement, neurasthenia, phobia and sadness) by U-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney criteria. established ranges of psychopathological phenomena's complexity reveal non-linear relations to etiology but in some cases they can be useful instrument of differential diagnostics of mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Alcoholics are those excessive drinkers whose dependence upon alcohol has attained such a degree that it shows a noticeable mental disturbance or an interference with their bodily and mental health, their interpersonal relationships and their smooth social and economic functioning, or who show the prodromal signs of such developments. One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

      "title": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although diseases similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been recognized for centuries under various rubrics, strict diagnostic criteria for conditions dominated by medically unexplained chronic fatigue were first proposed in 1988. Current diagnostic criteria were originally crafted in 1994 by an International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group as an attempt to standardize patient populations included in research studies. The International CFS Research Case Definition requires chronic fatigue of at least six‐months duration; this fatigue cannot be substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is associated with substantial reductions in occupational, social, and personal activities. In addition, at least four out of the following eight symptoms must occur with fatigue in a six‐month period: prolonged extraordinary postexertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, sore throat, tender glands, and new headaches (Fukuda et al., 1994). Importantly, the research case definition precludes classification as CFS if a patient has an identifiable medical cause of being fatigued. Similarly, individuals with certain psychiatric conditions cannot be classified as CFS in research studies. Exclusionary psychiatric conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and melancholic major depression. Notably, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders is relatively high. Recent data indicate that almost 60% of CFS cases in the population suffer from at least one comorbid psychiatric condition, with affective disorders being the most prevalent ones.",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

The essential feature is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic symptoms that constitute a dependence syndrome, indicating that the person has impaired control of psychoactive substance use and continues its use in spite of adverse consequences. Detoxification and treatment of psychiatric complications of alcoholism were discussed elsewhere. The psychotherapeutic approach is primarily supportive with many patients; the therapist plays an active and nurturing role while maintaining clear boundaries of separateness and setting firm limits that discourage acting out and enforce the abstinence rule. Treatment programs for the opioid addict include methadone maintenance, maintenance with opioid antagonists, therapeutic communities, and various abstinence-oriented recovery programs. In general, cocaine treatment programs use the methods of Alcoholics Anonymous, contingency contracting, and urine monitoring. In contrast to other substance use disorders, Nicotine Dependence alone is not associated with impairment in social or occupational functioning.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

It is characterized by behavior and other mental process which involve coercion for occasional or regular use of addiction resources with intention to experience it's effect on mental process or to avoid discomfort due to absence of such a resource (medium). Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living. Such different addictions have and different importance, influence and consequences and addiction does not have to be necessarily negative phenomenon although it is mostly considered and judged as such.

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "abstract": "Physical pain, psychological distress and the deleterious effects of medical procedures all cause the chronically ill to suffer as they experience their illnesses. However, a narrow medicalized view of suffering, solely defined as physical discomfort, ignores or minimizes the broader significance of the suffering experienced by debilitated chronically ill adults. A fundamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing social isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others. Each of these four scores of suffering is analysed in relation to its effects on the consciousness of the ill person. The data are drawn from a qualitative study of 57 chronically ill persons with varied diagnoses.",

      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

In this chapter, the terms “dual diagnosis,” “substance use disorder[s],” “[name of substance] use,” and/or “[name of substance] dependence” are used. The more modern term “co-occurring disorder” is virtually synonymous with “dual diagnosis,” both of which reference the coexistence of a clinically significant use of drugs and/or alcohol with a primary psychiatric illness (an example of this would be bipolar disorder with cocaine dependence). Of course, a patient can have a substance use disorder (SUD) without having a dual diagnosis – i.e., without a separate, primary psychiatric illness [1]. The assumption is made that, unless mentioned specifically, clinical situations discussed here involve patients who do have a primary psychiatric illness in addition to a SUD. Also, although the fairly recent, though now outdated, DSM-IV criteria differentiated between substance abuse and substance dependence, this volume (again, unless specifically mentioned) does not make that distinction.",

Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them. The current review presents an update of the neurological adverse effects resulting from the use of cannabis for medical purposes, highlighting the need to weigh the benefits and risks, when using cannabinoidbased treatments.",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

      "abstract": "When alcohol abuse occurs with depression, both the substance abuse and the mood disorder necessitate treatment. These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Taking opiates for medical purposes without supervision of healthcare professionals and non-medical purposes can cause different consequences such as delirium or even injury, and may cause addiction over a longer period of time. The most common recreational opium is heroin, while opium is rarely used. Opiate groups include opium, morphine, heroin, methadone and codeine. Addiction is manifested through physical and psychological dependence. Physical or biological dependence refers to the change in the biological state of the organism, while psychic addiction implies the forced necessity of entering the substance into the organism in order to restore good mood and to avoid the suffering of certain substances. Addiction leads to acute intoxication characterized by euphoria, facial redness, pruritus, impaired breathing depth, hypotension and bradycardia. Apart from the symptoms of acute intoxication, the use of opiates can lead to serious and even lethal consequences such as neurological diseases, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Treatment of opiate dependence implies treatment with naloxone and clinical treatment. Very important for the treatment of overexpression is to determine tolerance to opiates to determine the required dose of the drug. In the Republic of Croatia, the legal framework for the fight against drug abuse is based on the Criminal Code and the Law on Combating Drug Abuse, while at the European Union level the National Strategy for the Suppression of Drug Abuse in the Republic of Croatia was adopted. This research was carried out in order to determine the existence of differences in urban and rural addicts with regard to social demographic characteristics.Research has shown that addicts in urban areas are equally to addicts in rural areas by the time of arrival to the drogs band that addicts in urban and rural areas relatively early start with addiction treatment. The study included 57 respondents divided by sex and area of residence. From the data on opiate abuse by observing the most addicted counties, it is represented in Zagreb and Zagreb County, followed by Istrian and Krapina-Zagorje County.

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

Moreover, usual screening tests and diagnostic questionnaires are often not suited for the aged. Psychopathology of addictions in the aged points out vulnerabilities not resolved with the advance in age, in connection with separation, narcissism, oral regression, alexithymia and other pathological dimensions of personality. The weight of the environment, dominated by a certain agism, remains a brake to the global care that must be based, as in younger adults, on motivational approach and specific treatments with special pharmacological vigilance.",

Antidepressants and mood stabilizers, the medications commonly used to treat depression or bipolar illness, do not produce dependence and have no potential for abuse. They are safe for individuals in recovery from alcoholism or drug dependence. Depression is no longer attributed simply to too little neurochemicals such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Instead, depression is associated with a dysregulation of neurochemical firing patterns. Antidepressants treat specific symptoms of depression such as depressed mood, sadness, fatigue and suicidality, and they also regulate the altered brain chemistry that may contribute to these symptoms.",

Some outstanding questions remain and there are no clear answers so far regarding the differentiation of \"normality\" and pathology related to the SAD, like: (1) is a strong relationship between family members the consequence of specific cultural and social patterns or a pathological pattern that indicates SAD?, or (2) are the pain and suffering resulting from separation from loved ones after wars, natural or other disasters \"normal\"/common/expected or are they psychopathological manifestations of SAD?, etc. In order to clearly identify SAD as an unambiguous psychopathological category, it is necessary to answer these questions in detail.",

      "title": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders for mental health professionals - a brief review",
      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is a colorless, pungent, bitter, flammable liquid. The type of alcohol consumed as a beverage is known as ethanol. In general, the term \"\"alcohol\"\" in our language refers to all intoxicating and alcohol-containing beverages. The use of alcohol dates back to ancient times in human history. Often preferred for its pleasurable effects, the repeated and prolonged use of alcohol can lead to addiction. The World Health Organization defines an alcohol addict as \"\"a person who consumes alcohol for an extended period and in atypical amounts, whose mental, physical, and social health deteriorates due to alcohol, who cannot assess their condition, and even if they can, cannot stop the desire to consume alcohol, and who requires treatment.\"\" Currently, the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder are established by the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). Studies have shown that alcohol use disorder often does not occur in isolation but is accompanied by other psychiatric disorders. The co-occurrence of another psychiatric disorder with alcohol addiction is referred to as comorbidity. Some psychiatric disorders that may co-occur with alcohol dependence include anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and mood disorders. In this context, this chapter will address alcohol use disorder from both conceptual and legal perspectives, and examine its relationship with other psychiatric disorders, along with the frequency of their co-occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition.

The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions.

      "abstract": "The introduction of neuroleptic (or anti-psychotic) medication into clinical practice was a major advance in the treatment of schizophrenia. Numerous well-controlled, double-blind clinical trials have established the therapeutic efficacy of these agents in both the acute and long-term treatment of schizophrenia (Klein et al , 1980; Kane &amp; Lieberman, 1987). In general, the therapeutic benefit of medication has been assessed in terms of the relative reduction in the more florid signs and symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, agitation, and hostility) and the ability of maintenance medication to reduce the rate of recurrence of these symptoms and in turn rates of rehospitalisation. At the same time it has been quite apparent that anti-psychotic drugs do not necessarily eliminate some of the major chronic disabilities of patients with this illness, disabilities reflected in impoverished affect, lack of drive and ambition, impaired spontaneity, reduced ability to relate to others, and diminished pleasure capacity. These symptoms have at times been described as negative in that they reflect an absence of or reduction in certain aspects of psychologic, cognitive, and emotional functioning in an attempt to distinguish them from the distortions or exaggerations in normal function which characterise positive symptoms (Strauss &amp; Carpenter, 1974; Jackson, 1904).",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is the most frequent, complex, multidimensional, and debilitating symptom in patients with advanced life-limiting diseases. In cancer patients, it is defined as ‘distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning’. In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Back to table of contents Previous article Next article Clinical & ResearchFull AccessMisuse of Steroids, Other Performance Enhancers Slips Under RadarNick ZagorskiNick ZagorskiSearch for more papers by this authorPublished Online:24 Feb 2022https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.pn.2022.03.10.42AbstractThe misuse of legal muscle builders and/or illicit steroids combines elements of eating and substance use disorders.iStock/Light Field StudiosDSM-5-TR recognizes 10 broad types of substance use disorders, ranging from disorders involving substances that can be purchased over the counter (alcohol and tobacco) to prescription medications (stimulants, hypnotics, and pain relievers) and illicit drugs (cocaine). However, some mental health professionals think one important class of substances remains missing from this list: anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).Now, anabolic steroids are briefly mentioned in DSM-5-TR as an example that might fit in the “Other or Unknown Substance-Related Disorders” category. Harrison Pope, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and leading researcher on anabolic steroids, is among those who think steroids and other PEDs deserve more clinical visibility. He noted that steroid users in particular show all the signs of biological and psychological dependence: they take larger quantities over time, experience withdrawal effects when not taking them, and continue to use them despite warnings to stop from loved ones or the emergence of adverse side effects.PED use is also prevalent enough to deserve its own category, Pope said. A study published in 2020 found that about 16% of young men aged 18 to 26 in the United States reported using legal performance enhancers, such as creatine supplements, while nearly 3% reported using anabolic steroids (which are illegal without a prescription). Among women, 1.2% reported using legal PEDs, while 0.8% reported using anabolic steroids. Some of Pope’s own research has indicated that there may be as many as 1 million adults in the United States who show the signs of steroid dependence.“PEDs are definitely misused by many people and pose serious health consequences,” said Wilson Compton, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a member of the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Work Group for DSM-5. “The question is do they share the specific criteria outlined for other SUDs?”Compton told Psychiatric News that one of the key elements separating PEDs from other drugs in the SUD category is that steroids and other PEDs are not consumed for an immediate high but rather taken over weeks to gradually change body shape. Another issue is that some substances known to enhance performance, such as caffeine or amphetamines, are in existing categories.What Drives PED Use?With more data, PED misuse may one day fit into the chapter on eating disorders in the DSM.Similar to people with an eating disorder, most people who use PEDs struggle with issues related to a distorted body image, said Kyle Ganson, Ph.D., a clinical social worker and assistant professor at the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto. (To the contrary of media narratives, PED misuse is not confined to bodybuilders, baseball players, or other high-performance athletes). PED misuse also often begins in adolescence, he continued; youth may see themselves as weak or flabby and undertake a range of behaviors including diets, increased exercise, and the use of substances to boost metabolism or muscle growth.“These aren’t stereotypical eating disorder behaviors,” said Jason Nagata, M.D., M.Sc., an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. “Instead of vomiting, they work out intensely; instead of diet pills, they overuse steroids.”Because PEDs are more frequently used by males than females and the use of these products typically leads to a more toned body, PED misuse can be easily missed by parents, teachers, and even doctors.“Typically, the person will start with one legal supplement like whey protein, then advance to a polysubstance pattern,” Ganson said. “For many, the trajectory may lead to illicit substances like steroids.”A study of national survey data conducted by Nagata, Ganson, and colleagues found that male youth who use legal PEDs are about three times as likely to subsequently use anabolic steroids as those who do not use PEDs.Even users who don’t progress to illegal PEDs face risks, Nagata said. Recent longitudinal data have also suggested that youth who use legal PEDs are more likely to subsequently engage in drinking, risky sexual behaviors, and criminal offenses compared with those who do not. Over-the-counter performance enhancers are also not harmless; as with many nutritional supplements, they are poorly regulated and often contaminated with other substances. (Nagata noted that a handful of states, including Massachusetts, have proposed regulations to ban the sale of muscle-enhancing and/or weight loss supplements to minors due to concerns over health risks.)Screening for PED MisuseAs with Pope and others who have witnessed the detrimental effects of these drugs, Ganson and Nagata believe the misuse of steroids and other PEDs warrants its own section in the DSM. “It would help professionals better screen for this disorder in youth while also raising awareness about the male eating disorder experience,” Nagata said.Nagata acknowledged the difficulty in finding a diagnostic home for PED misuse given how trans-diagnostic it is; in addition to sharing traits with substance use disorders and eating disorders, PED misuse overlaps with body dysmorphic disorder. Many youth who use these substances can develop unhealthy obsessions and repetitive behaviors related to their appearance. Nagata noted that muscle dysphoria, a disorder in which people become preoccupied with large muscles, was added to DSM-5 as a subtype of body dysmorphic disorder; however, that disorder reflects only a small portion of people who misuse PEDs.Despite the lack of clear diagnostic criteria, there are clues psychiatrists and other health professionals can look for to identify potential cases of performance-enhancing drug misuse. As noted, this is primarily—but not entirely—an issue among young men, especially those who experience adverse life events or social stigma.“It makes sense that youth who are put in positions to feel defenseless would turn to behaviors aimed at getting stronger,” Ganson said. He was part of a study published last year that identified childhood sexual abuse as a significant risk factor for both legal and illicit performance-enhancing drug use. “What was unusual in that study was that while women are much less likely overall to use PEDs, the rates of use among men or women who were abused were roughly similar,” he said.Nagata added that PED use is also elevated among sexual minorities; a recent study he conducted found that around 44% of gay or bisexual men and 30% of gay or bisexual women had used PEDs in their lifetime; those that reported PED use were more likely to have symptoms of disordered eating or muscle dysphoria. Nagata said this elevated use is driven by both stigma and social media representations of ideal body types. Few studies have examined PED use in transgender individuals, but Nagata said that he believes some people transitioning from female to male would look for ways to become more muscular and masculine, so they might be another group likely to misuse PEDs.Physicians should be prepared to ask patients who report mood swings and/or aggression about use of PEDs and other muscle enhancing behaviors.“One of the issues complicating PED misuse is that we don’t know what crosses the line between the safe versus risky use of legal PEDs,” Nagata said. “Therefore, it is useful to focus on overall behaviors. Have the youth stopped engaging with friends or family to work out instead? Have they eliminated certain foods or made other major dietary changes? As with other substance use disorders, any use that has an adverse impact on their school, work, or social life is problematic.”Pope noted that while patients who misuse steroids may be less willing to admit their use than those who use over-the-counter products, a routine blood test can provide clues whether a patient is misusing these substances. “Significantly lower levels of the good cholesterol (HDL), coupled with elevated bad cholesterol (LDL), is one telltale clue of steroid misuse,” he said. “Elevated numbers of red blood cells is another possible sign.” Other common symptoms of steroid use that might be seen by a primary care doctor include high blood pressure, truncal acne (on the back, chest, neck, or arms), and the emergence of breast tissue in men. “It’s important that more health professionals begin asking questions about these substances,” Ganson said. While many youth may be driven to start taking PEDs to become stronger, misuse can pose physical and mental health risks. ■“Prevalence and Correlates of Muscle-Enhancing Behaviors Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States” is posted here.“Associations Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Performance-Enhancing Substance Use Among Young Adults” is posted here.“Appearance and Performance-Enhancing Drugs and Supplements (Apeds): Lifetime Use and Associations With Eating Disorder and Muscle Dysmorphia Symptoms Among Cisgender Sexual Minority People” is posted here.“The Lifetime Prevalence of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use and Dependence in Americans: Current Best Estimates” is posted here ISSUES NewArchived",

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A stigma is a mark of infamy or disgrace. People who are stigmatised are subject to abuse and social exclusion. Negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are attributed to stigma. In the literature, stigma is regarded as something that is attached to a person ‐ like a badge or label. This is undermined by two facts. Firstly, it is the person who is regarded as disgraceful, not the illness or diagnosis, and secondly, the diagnosis of mental illness is itself evaluative. Mental illness is by definition bad, so to be diagnosed as mentally ill is to be defined as bad (or somehow wrong). The stigmatisation of the mentally ill will not stop until this negative evaluation is removed from diagnosis.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

      "title": "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom and related disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent physical symptoms or complaints that are associated with significant distress and impairment. The conceptualization of these disorders under the category of somatoform disorders in DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000) required that these somatic presentations lack objective organic causes. This latter requirement has been deleted in DSM-5, largely because somatic symptoms often do have related medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Even when such associations have not been established, the assumption that they are present has often led to patients being labeled in pejorative ways, as if they are faking symptoms or somehow responsible for their own suffering. The seven disorders encompassed in the DSM-5 category of somatic symptom and related disorders are somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. DSM-IV disorders that are subsumed under this new nomenclature include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and factitious disorders (which appeared in their own separate category in DSM-IV). Body dysmorphic disorder is not included in the new somatic symptom disorder category and is now classified as one of the other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence rates in the literature for what were previously labeled somatoform disorders varied by diagnosis, but in general and across ages these disorders have been seen in 16% of primary care outpatients and in 23% of outpatients with medically unexplained symptoms (de Waal et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV diagnoses in a sample of patients suggests that prevalence rates are similar across the old and new nomenclatures (Voigt et al. 2012). Older individuals with somatic symptom and related disorders are seen in all health care settings, where they frequently overuse medical services and overburden general practitioners (de Waal et al. 2008; Puri and Dimsdale 2011). They often come to the attention of a geriatric psychiatrist after another clinician has attempted unsuccessfully to resolve their physical symptoms. To date, the somatic symptom and related disorders have not been well studied in late life, in part because many of the disorders tend to begin in early adulthood. In addition, research involving older cohorts has usually focused on reported somatic symptoms rather than on specific diagnoses. A complicating factor is that somatoform symptoms in late life are often obscured by comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, these disorders have been strongly associated with stress, depression, anxiety, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and personality disorders (de Waal et al. 2004; Haftgoli et al. 2010; Hasin and Katz, 2007; Sack et al. 2007; Tomenson et al. 2012). DSM-5 is trying to make the diagnoses more parsimonious by eliminating the requirement for medically unexplained symptoms, but additional research is needed to further elucidate their characteristics under the new nomenclature.",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractWithdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "abstract": "Patients with cancer typically experience multiple symptoms related to cancer and cancer treatment. These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Tradicionalmente se han venido distinguiendo dos grandes tipologias de criminalidad relacionadas con las drogas, la delincuencia funcional y la delincuencia inducida. En ambos casos de criminalidad la causa de la delincuencia es el consumo de drogas. El Codigo penal de 1995 presta especial atencion al problema del consumo y la dependencia de las drogas aportando una regulacion especifica sobre la incidencia que sobre la capacidad de culpabilidad tiene el consumo y la dependencia de las drogas. La eximente de intoxicacion requiere tres elementos: Un presupuesto biologico o psiquiatrico, un estado de intoxicacion en el momento de cometer el delito un componente psicologico, imposibilidad de comprender el caracter ilicito de su conducta o de actuar conforme a ese conocimiento y un requisito\nnegativo, que la intoxicacion no haya sido provocada con el proposito de cometer el delito o que el sujeto haya previsto o debido prever que en estado de intoxicacion podria cometer un delito. El sindrome de abstinencia es una alteracion psiquica que se caracteriza por un sindrome especifico, que viene determinado por la clase de sustancia, debido al cese o reduccion del consumo prolongado de esa sustancia. El estado carencial crea una presion motivacional que explica la falta de libertad en el proceso de determinacion de la voluntad para actuar conforme a la norma. La adiccion a sustancias psicoactivas se define como un estado psiquico y fisico determinado por el consumo continuado de droga durante un periodo de tiempo, que se caracteriza por la perdida del control en el uso de la susta\nncia. La introduccion de la atenuante de grave adiccion supone reconocer que el consumo de drogas reiterado puede ocasionar una adiccion a las sustancias, que influye en la capacidad volitiva del sujeto limitando de forma relevante su\ncapacidad de actuar conforme a la norma dado la compulsion al consumo de esa sustancia. Desde esta concepcion de la grave adiccion lo coherente hubiera sido reconocer a la grave adiccion como un supuesto de semi-imputabilidad y no como una mera atenuante de la culpabilidad. Lo que permitiria, sin necesidad de acudir a la analogia in bonam partem, aplicar al adicto la medida de seguridad de tratamiento de deshabituacion.",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "The utility of classical drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) is often limited by issues of lack of efficacy, delayed onset of action or side effects. Psychoactive substances have a long history of being used as tools to alter consciousness and as a gateway to approach the unknown and the divinities. These substances were initially obtained from plants and animals and more recently by chemical synthesis, and its consumption evolved toward a more recreational use, leading to drug abuse-related disorders, trafficking, and subsequent banning by the authorities. However, these substances, by modulation of certain neurochemical pathways, have been proven to have a beneficial effect on some psychiatric disorders. This evidence obtained under medically controlled conditions and often associated with psychotherapy, makes these substances an alternative to conventional medicines, to which in many cases the patient does not respond properly. Such disorders include post-traumatic stress disease and treatment-resistant depression, for which classical drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin and LSD, among others, have already been clinically tested, reporting successful outcomes. The irruption of new psychoactive substances (NPS), especially during the last decade and despite their recreational and illicit uses, has enlarged the library of substances with potential utility on these disorders. In fact, many of them were synthetized with therapeutic purposes and were withdrawn for concrete reasons (e.g., adverse effects, improper pharmacological profile). In this review we focus on the basis, existing evidence and possible use of synthetic cathinones and psychedelics (specially tryptamines) for the treatment of mental illnesses and the properties that should be found in NPS to obtain new therapeutic compounds.",

      "abstract": "In previous papers (2, 3) we have set forth our neurophysiopathogenic theory of alcoholism, which is an amplification of Jellinek's hypothesis (1) that the gamma and delta types of alcoholism form an addictive disease. The physical dependence characterized by a state of distress and an overpowering desire to consume more ethanol, assumes three forms: ( a) “inability to stop” the ingestion (Jellinek's “loss of control”) noted moments after ingesting a small quantity of ethanol following a period of abstinence, which characterizes the gamma or intermittent clinical form of alcoholism; ( b) “inability to abstain” from ethanol hours after the last ingestion and after continuous drinking (each 4 to 8 hours during months or years), which characterizes the delta or inveterate clinical form of alcoholism, and ( c) primary physical dependence without ethanol having necessarily been ingested previously, which characterizes remittent, or epsilon alcoholism or dipsomania.",

High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmia, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Regular users may experience dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation with abstinence. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected users; these include individual or group counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. Long-acting amphetamines have been shown to reduce other stimulant use, but not complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 hours apart, one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years, diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities.

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

      "abstract": "Les intoxications aiguës ou chroniques, par des agents pharmacologiques, des substances illicites ou des agents de notre environnement, peuvent entraîner des manifestations convulsives dont l'incidence est difficile à établir. Les propriétés intrinsèques des molécules peuvent expliquer certaines manifestations. Il semble, parmi les médicaments, que l'incidence des convulsions induites par les antidépresseurs tricycliques était particulièrement importante. Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

I. The author considers the problems of psychotropic drugs in Japan in 2 categories: those unique to Japan (1-5) and those related to psychotropic drugs in general (6-9). 1. \"Arbitrary\" administration (i. e., the prescription is different with each psychiatrist, therefore standardization is necessary). 2. Polypharmacy (i. e., unreasonable combination is made). 3. Many different drugs with similar effect (therefore, new drugs should be controlled). 4. \"Stereotype\" of doctor's prescription for long-term use. 5. Limited prescription due to health insurances. 6. Doubtful effect on long-term prognosis of chronic schizophrenics. 7. Psycho-social burden of patients taking drugs continuously. 8. Undesirable effects like prolongation of depressive episode, lowered mental activity, or blunting of affect. 9. Side effects such as dependence, tardive dyskinesia, malignant syndrome, or teratogenecity. II. Tardive dyskinesea, malignant syndrome and teratogenecity are explained in detail. III. The author expresses the wishes for future development of psychotropic drugs as follows: 1. Good balance of \"effect\", \"side effect\", and \"price\" of clinical drugs. 2. Introduction of safe long-acting drugs which promote social rehabilitation of mental patients. 3. Development of more specifically effective drugs. 4. Convenient way of measurement of drug serum level. 5. Contribution to understanding of pathogenesis of mental disorders through researches on effects and side effects of drugs. Finally, the author stresses the necessity of more cooperation between clinical and basic medicine.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN La aparición de síntomas psicóticos es una de las complicaciones más frecuentes producidas por el consumo agudo o crónico de cocaína, apareciendo hasta en el 65-70% de los consumidores. El síndrome de Ekbom se ha relacionado con múltiples causas, entre ellas el consumo de estimulantes y con la abstinencia al alcohol. El paciente tiene la convicción delirante monotemática de estar infectado por parásitos, lo cual puede acompañarse de otras manifestaciones como alteraciones sensoperceptivas. OBJETIVOS Analizar el papel de la cocaína en la aparición del síndrome de Ekbom. MATERIAL Y MÉTODO Descripción de un caso clínico y su revisión bibliográfica. Varón de 56 años, sin antecedentes en Salud Mental. Ex consumidor de cannabis y cocaína. Como antecedentes somáticos presenta infección por VHC curada y VIH. Recae en el consumo de cocaína tras fallecimiento de un familiar en Enero 2022, siendo derivado a la Unidad de Hospitalización en Junio 2022 por convicción delirante paranoide y actividad alucinatoria. En la exploración psicopatológica el paciente presenta delirios de infestación y zoopsias. En la exploración física observamos escoriaciones y cicatrices que se corresponden con rascado. Sin embargo, en el examen clínico no se encuentran alteraciones que justifiquen estas lesiones. Al ingreso comienza con Olanzapina 10mg desapareciendo la sintomatología en un par de días. CONCLUSIONES Es necesario hacer un correcto diagnóstico diferencial, mediante un examen clínico exhaustivo, el cual, en este caso, no pone de manifiesto ninguna patología física que justifique el cuadro, a pesar de lo cual el paciente presenta absoluta convicción. La idea delirante se ha relacionado con el aumento de los niveles de dopamina en los ganglios basales por el bloqueo del transportador de dopamina que producen los psicoestimulantes como la cocaína. De esta forma, es imprescindible el cese del consumo de tóxicos y un correcto tratamiento con neurolépticos.",

      "title": "Is it time to end our complicity with pharmacocentricity?",
      "abstract": "Psychotropic medications have traditionally dominated the treatment of mental health problems. The administration of psychotropic medications and monitoring for effects, side effects, and adherence therefore consumes considerable time for mental health nurses (MHN). While there is no doubt many people believe psychotropic medications have helped them, the weight of research evidence questioning their effectiveness and exposing their associated debilitating side effect burden (particularly over the long term) is now too compelling to be ignored. This has prompted the claim that, on balance, psychotropic medications cause more harm than good (Gotzche et al. 2015). The most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications are antidepressants and antipsychotics, yet these names are misleading. They create the impression that psychotropic medications remove a pathogen like an antibiotic removes a bacteria, when this is not the case (Rosenman 2016). Unlike physical conditions such as diabetes, Crohn's disease or cystic fibrosis, for example, there is no pathophysiology or a single identifiable biomarker associated with any psychiatric diagnosis. Diagnoses such as ‘schizophrenia’ or ‘bipolar disorder’ are based on a consensus model and therefore represent simply one version of the truth, not established scientific facts (Wand 2015). The rationale supporting psychotropic medications is based on the assumption that mental illnesses are predominantly biological and are ameliorated at a neurochemical level, conveying the message to the ‘sufferer’ that they are biologically inferior (Hall 2018). However, there is no evidence that mental illness is due to a chemical imbalance of the brain, and while genetics and biology play a role in all aspects of the human condition, the degree to which genetics and biology influence mental health and well-being remains a matter of speculation. What is known (without question) is that mental health and well-being are predominantly determined by what happens to people after they are born, not what they are born with. Childhood adversity and instability, abuse and neglect, socio-economic disadvantage, discrimination, bullying, rape, incarceration, war, substance misuse, and human rights violations all make far greater contributions to mental ill-health than heredity (World Health Organization, 2013). Indeed, it is disrespectful, and unrealistic, to expect that a medication will mend such harrowing experiences. For example, it is reported that hearing voices in 77% of people diagnosed with ‘schizophrenia’ is related to traumatic experiences. The widely held contemporary view is that voice hearing is a normal human experience that voices have meaning for individuals and are ‘parts of the self’ that should not be ignored. People are encouraged to accept voices and establish a dialogue with them. Conversely, attempting to ‘get rid’ of voices through medication interferes with emotional processing and understanding the meaning of voices (Mosquera & Ross 2017). Several studies have identified that antidepressants are little or no better than placebo for the majority of people with depression (Barbui et al. 2011; Fournier et al. 2010; Khan & Brown 2015; Kirsch et al. 2008). This has attracted little mainstream media attention. Yet curiously, a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis published in the Lancet by Cipriani et al. (2018) which reported only modest effect sizes from 522 trials of 21 antidepressants evoked media claims that the debate on antidepressant effectiveness was now over, because this study proved antidepressants ‘worked’ (Boseley 2018; Rice-Oxley 2018). Following the publication of this review, numerous critiques of the study emerged online. The essence of these criticisms is encompassed by McCormack and Korownyk (2018). They highlight that the review rated 82% of studies as having moderate to high risk of bias and that 78% of studies (when declared) were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Reviews such as these do not identify who or how many people should be treated with antidepressants, especially given an estimated 30–40% of placebo groups report improvement or remission. A major criticism is that claims of antidepressant effectiveness are typically based on 6- to 8-week clinical trials. Assertions that antidepressants work neglect long-term effects (and outcomes) from taking antidepressants, and the comparative benefits and harms relative to nonpharmacological approaches (McCormack & Korownyk 2018). Importantly, the authors of the study were not nearly as confident of the claims made by media outlets, for example conceding that ‘Depressive symptoms tend to spontaneously improve over time and this phenomenon contributes to the high percentage of placebo responders in antidepressant trials’ (Cipriani et al. 2018, pp. 1363). This conforms to the widespread recognition that improvement in depressive symptoms is often due to the passage of time, or placebo effect. Individuals (and the prescriber), however, tend to give antidepressants credit they do not deserve. Whittaker (2016) has published an extensive review and analysis of the research literature on antipsychotics from the 1950s to the present. This longitudinal perspective reveals that antipsychotic medications may provide short-term benefits, but on the whole, they worsen long-term outcomes. The conclusion drawn is that antipsychotics induce physiological changes in the brain leaving individuals more vulnerable to psychosis. The collective research examined indicates that long-term use of antipsychotic medications worsen psychotic symptoms, and impairs functional capacities, making individuals more ‘socially dependent’ than before their illness. Conversely, longitudinal studies from the USA, Netherlands, and Australia have all found that minimal or no use of antipsychotics is associated with better outcomes. Essentially, antipsychotic medications increase the ‘chronicity of schizophrenia’ and other psychotic conditions and impede recovery (Whittaker 2016). These assertions are supported by Harrow and Jobe (2018) who agree that while antipsychotic medications demonstrate short-term benefits, there are now eight major studies that fail to find better outcomes for individuals with ‘schizophrenia’ treated with antipsychotic medications on a long-term basis. In their study, Harrow et al. (2017) followed up 139 people diagnosed with ‘schizophrenia’ and ‘schizoaffective disorder’ over 20 years. Their findings show significant differences and large effect sizes in work functioning in favour of individuals not prescribed antipsychotic medication long term. In general, people continuously prescribed antipsychotics were significantly more likely to have negative symptoms than those not prescribed antipsychotics at 4.5 years follow-up. Moreover, a large percentage of those individuals continuously prescribed antipsychotics were rehospitalized multiple times. The authors maintain that any hypothesis based on antipsychotics facilitating work functioning is dubious and that no strong evidence exists for the treatment of antipsychotic medication beyond three years (Harrow et al. 2017). Additionally, concerns have been raised over the widespread off-label use of antipsychotics such as quetiapine for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress, ‘personality disorders’, dementia, and substance misuse when there is no evidence to support its use for these health problems (Brett 2015). There is growing awareness of the significant withdrawal and discontinuation effects of psychotropic medications, which are often distressing and can endure for many months after cessation. This phenomenon is reported in the scholarly literature (Cartwright et al. 2016; Hall 2018; Ostrow et al. 2017; Read et al. 2018) and mainstream media (Carey & Gebeloff 2018; Edemariam 2017). Traditionally, people have been informed that these symptoms are a ‘relapse’ of their condition and proof that the medication was working. This is not logical. For example, with regard to relapse studies and antipsychotic discontinuation, Whittaker (2016) argues it cannot be known from this research how much of the ‘relapse’ symptoms are due to a withdrawal effect, and how much might be interpreted as a (yet to be explicated) ‘return of the disease’. This uncertainty makes it impossible to draw conclusions from these studies about the long-term protective effects of antipsychotics against relapse (Whittaker 2016). Given the questionable effectiveness of psychotropic medications over the long term and their unquestionable side effect burden, the clear indication is that these medications (if prescribed at all) should be taken sparingly and for the shortest time possible, and nonpharmacological approaches emphasized. Thankfully, the number of nonpharmacological options available for enhancing mental health and well-being is extensive. From a psychiatric survivor perspective, Hall (2012) takes a pragmatic view of psychotropic medications proposing they can blunt or control symptoms of mental distress and consequently ‘take the edge’ off extreme states. However, they do not address the underlying causes of mental distress and are therefore best understood as tools or coping mechanisms that sometimes alleviate symptoms. A report from the Mental Health Commission of NSW (2015) titled Medication and mental illness: Perspectives provided valuable insights into what people want from their mental health clinicians and services with regard to psychotropic medication. While positive experiences with medications were highlighted, the far greater weight of opinion was negative. Consumers and carers identified that their concerns about medications (especially side effects and polypharmacy) were either ignored or dismissed. An emphasis on learning skills of self-care and self-management was preferred. In the report under the heading Towards change, a list summarized ‘what people told the Commission’; The dilemma now facing MHNs is how to respond to the recognition that psychotropic medications are conceivably causing more harm than good, especially the longer people take them. Services such as clozapine and depot clinics would not function without the support of MHNs, who are also routinely involved in compelling people to take psychotropic medications. Moreover, while programmes developed by MHNs to monitor and screen for side effects and complications from taking psychotropic medications are commendable (especially given the physical health complications encountered by people experiencing mental ill-health are principally iatrogenic in nature), the risk versus benefit ratio does not support the traditional view that people should be maintained on psychotropic medications long term. The ethical principle of nonmaleficence obliges MHNs to inform individuals (and their carers) of the effects, side effects, and current research on the effectiveness of these agents. Furthermore, people should be routinely informed of the contemporary understanding that mental health challenges are predominantly attributed to human experiences of adversity, instability, and trauma, rather than simply predetermined by biology or genetics.",

Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness.

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

Substances covered include alcohol, benzodiazepines and other GABA-agonists, opioids, cocaine and other stimulants, hallucinogens, and designer drugs including synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, and MDMA. Urine drug testing, long-term opioid maintenance treatment, and mixed delirium states are discussed. The necessity to refer patients for further treatment of the SUD is also stressed.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "title": "TWO CASES OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS DEVELOPING AFTER SEVERE MENTAL EMOTION AND SHOCK",
      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness. Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicide Differential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made. Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness.

      "abstract": "In discussions of diversion and misuse of medications in adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the word “misuse” is intentionally used. Abuse of a medication refers to excessive use of a drug to achieve a “high,” which may result in addiction to the medication and which causes dysfunction in a patient's life. However, misuse refers to usage of a medication without a prescription or for reasons other than that which it was prescribed. Diversion refers to the diverting of legally prescribed medication into illegal use by other than the patient. Sahakian and Morein-Zamir recently discussed the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by individuals with a variety of disorders as well as off-label and non-prescription use by the general public. In addition to inappropriate use of medications, patients with ADHD often turn to other substances that are detrimental to their health, such as nicotine.",

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children. They grew up with a father or both parents, in these alcoholics no existence, depending on the family or the father has, have trouble with the law as well as injuries in a drunken state.

      "abstract": "The expression “New Synthetic Stimulants” include classes of psychoactive compounds that share subjective effects in humans such as boosted mood or euphoria, feelings of empathy or compassion, increased sociability and sex drive, perceived increased ability to learn and focus, increased energy and alertness, with unpleasant outcomes like increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia or aberrations, decreased appetite, raised body temperature, clenched jaw or grinding teeth, dry mouth, insomnia, hallucinations, and aggressive or violent behavior. Synthetic stimulants act in the brain by increasing concentrations of neurotransmitters, mainly dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is involved in attention, reward, and motivation whereas serotonin is involved in generating feelings of happiness and pleasure. Synthetic stimulants act on the two brain systems to different extents, accounting for their range of effects. Noradrenaline release is also stimulated by these compounds, but to a minor degree. In any case, long‐term use of synthetic stimulants exhausts dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. The nerve cells become desensitized to the drugs, which makes them resistant to the brain's own signaling molecules. This leads to tolerance and dependence, which can easily turn into addiction. Like classic stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), new synthetic stimulants can be highly addictive. This article is categorized under: Toxicology &gt; New Psychoactive Substances",

      "title": "Positive findings for negative symptoms of schizophrenia: no longer untreatable?",
      "abstract": "Until recently, negative symptoms of schizophrenia have been considered difficult to define, hard to measure, and nearly impossible to treat. Now comes a study from Lecrubier et al. (1) suggesting somewhat counter-intuitively that a low (5 mg) but not a high (20 mg) dose of one of the atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine, may be useful in improving negative symptoms of this devastating illness. This observation emerges from a field currently undergoing a resurgence of interest and optimism about negative symptoms of schizophrenia (2–7). A consensus now exists among experts that negative symptoms of schizophrenia – such as alogia, blunted affect, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition – represent not only a domain of schizophrenia distinct from positive symptoms, but possibly even the core deficit of this illness (2). Furthermore, negative symptoms of schizophrenia may have a different etiology and neurobiology (8) from other domains of this illness, especially from the positive symptoms (2–7). It would not be surprising if negative symptoms therefore require a different treatment approach than positive symptoms, which are undoubtedly improved by the agents that block a high degree of dopamine D2 receptors (9). Disentangling negative symptoms from the other symptoms of schizophrenia and its treatments have never been easy, and the approach taken by Lecrubier et al. is an interesting one. Although negative symptoms usually exist concomitantly and in the same patients with positive symptoms, Lecrubier et al. decided to study patients with almost no positive symptoms. This novel approach intended to eliminate the possibility that any improvement in negative symptoms would be caused by a ‘pseudospecific’ improvement in positive symptoms rather than caused by a true improvement in negative symptoms, a legitimate worry because the two agents chosen for this study, olanzapine and amisulpride, have well-established robust actions on positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Lecrubier et al. found that patients receiving 5 mg of olanzapine showed statistically significant improvements in negative symptoms (in both primary and secondary efficacy measures) compared with placebo. Interestingly, these patients also showed statistically significant (yet clinically unimportant) improvements in their already low levels of positive symptoms. Nevertheless, the authors’ strategy of selecting patients with predominantly negative symptoms seems to have been largely if not fully successful in disentangling the improvement in negative symptoms for 5 mg of olanzapine from the small improvements in positive symptoms at this dose. On the other hand, depression ratings also improved in the 5-mg olanzapine group, so it is possible that the improvement of depressive ratings could have contributed to the improvement of negative symptom ratings. A surprise from this study is that low doses of amisulpride, an agent previously demonstrated – including by this group – to improve negative symptoms, failed to show improvements of negative symptoms here. The reasons for this are unclear, but the 150 mg dose may have been a bit high. One striking outcome of this study is that patients receiving 5 mg of olanzapine, a dose lower than that used to treat schizophrenia in general and positive symptoms in particular, showed improvements in negative symptoms, but patients receiving a standard dose of olanzapine, 20 mg, did not show improvements in negative symptoms. Assuming that this observation is real and replicable, how can olanzapine improve negative symptoms at low doses but not at high doses? One possible explanation for this seeming paradox may lie in the fact that the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, like all atypical antipsychotics, has different receptor actions at high doses than it has at low doses (9). That is, when dosed for treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, olanzapine, like every known antipsychotic, occupies a substantial number (perhaps 70–90%) of dopamine D2 receptors (9). At high doses, olanzapine also fully saturates serotonin 5HT2A receptors, an action presumed to make olanzapine an atypical antipsychotic (9). At high doses, olanzapine also occupies numerous other receptors (9). However, at low doses of olanzapine, D2 receptors are occupied at doses thought to be too low to be useful in treating positive symptoms. At low doses, only the most potent actions of olanzapine come into play. As olanzapine's actions at serotonin receptors, especially actions at 5HT2C and 5HT2A receptors, are more potent than its actions at D2 receptors, these are the pharmacologic actions that may become critical at low doses. Substantial occupancy at serotonin receptors, not substantial actions at D2 receptors, could explain olanzapine's apparent low-dose therapeutic results on negative symptoms. It is known that blockade of these serotonin receptors leads to robust increases in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine in prefrontal cortex, and this could be the action of olanzapine that hypothetically improves negative symptoms (9). This idea is given a boost by recent observations that another agent with more selective actions on serotonin receptors than on dopamine D2 receptors, asenapine (10), may also improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia (11). Although studied in patients with both positive and negative symptoms, asenapine not only improved both positive and negative symptoms, but it improved the negative symptoms better than did risperidone, an agent without the same high-potency actions on multiple serotonin receptors (11). Thus, it may be possible to reconcile the results of low but not high dose olanzapine, as well as the results of asenapine but not risperidone improving negative symptoms, by attributing these clinical results to the unique high-potency actions on serotonin receptors. This idea may be worthy of investigating further with other agents with high potency on serotonin receptors. In order to relieve the disability of schizophrenia and improve long-term outcomes of this devastating illness, it will be necessary to do much better in terms of improving negative symptoms than we have performed to date. The lead from Lecrubier et al. is a good start, but much more robust actions on negative symptoms will be required in order to have a major impact on schizophrenia. Methods have now been suggested for designing studies to augment current atypical antipsychotics with novel agents (2–7). New methods for evaluating negative symptoms themselves are under consideration (12). It is hoped that these developments will lead to an explosion in research for therapeutic agents capable of significantly reducing the burden of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300).

      "title": "Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are medical and mental health conditions that affect millions of people worldwide, of all ages, races, genders and socioeconomic levels. Men are affected at a higher rate than women, but substance misuse among women is increasing. SUDs range from mild to severe and occur when the use of alcohol and/or other legal or illicit drugs cause clinically significant impairment, including health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, and/or home. The disorders are recurrent and often serious, but treatable, and many people do recover. The most severe SUDs are sometimes called “addictions,” though the terms “addiction” or “addicts” can be stigmatizing. This terminology often poses a barrier to seeking and receiving help. In more recent work, the term that is used in professional and clinical contexts is “substance misuse.” According to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision, SUDs encompass ten separate classes of legal and illicit drugs: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis (marijuana); hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics; stimulants (amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, etc.); and tobacco. The overall costs of SUDs to individuals, their families, and their communities are staggering. These costs include compromised physical and mental health; reduced quality of life; increased crime and violence; increased motor vehicle crashes; abuse and neglect of children; loss of productivity; and health care costs. The United States ranks twenty-seventh among developed countries in life expectancy; the rate has plateaued and is declining for certain subpopulations. This trend is due largely to substance misuse. This article outlines a comprehensive range of resources on the complex, evolving subject of SUDs, through a social work lens. It begins with a general overview of SUDs, followed by works on diagnosis, and resources regarding SUDs and certain subpopulations: people of color, people with mental illness, older adults, youth, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersex, asexual and other gender/sexual identity (LGBTQIA+) people. References focusing on screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT); and treatment approaches are also included. Specific subsections are devoted to outlining resources on alcohol, marijuana/cannabis, opioids and tobacco use disorders as well. The article concludes with resources regarding significant policy dimensions of SUDs and the neuroscience behind these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Kratom, a non-federally regulated botanical herb, is widely growing in popularity as a naturopathic alternative for mood, anxiety, and attention deficit symptoms, along with legal recreational use as a psychoactive agent. It is predominantly sold without restriction and easily accessible over the counter at naturopathic, specialty \"vape\" or \"smoke shops\" and on the internet. Kratom's most abundant alkaloids, Mytragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-MG), have demonstrated multi-mechanistic properties via dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic, and mu-opioid-type receptors interaction in a dose-dependent manner. Given the reported association between Kratom consumption and its mood-altering and stimulant-like effects, we considered its role in the exacerbation of those predisposed to or with certain preexisting mental health disorders. In addition, Kratom's psychoactive compound derivatives are not detected in routine urine toxicology screens, which may pose a diagnostic obstacle when suspecting its use in critical settings such as acute mania or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Considering its growing availability, potential for addiction, and withdrawal, the authors aim to highlight the need for further research on the potential effects of Kratom and its use as a crucial consideration during assessment, as well as the association between Kratom use and the exacerbation of those predisposed to or with certain preexisting mental health disorders. We concluded that, on balance, there was sufficient evidence to justify the plausibility of the association between Kratom ingestion in exceeding doses and the exacerbation of certain psychiatric manifestations such as psychosis.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

      "abstract": "In legal practice it is assumed that the ordinary man intends the natural consequences of his acts. When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common emotional state in humans, which is sometimes triggered by stressful events and certain physical and/or mental conditions that may occur and may increase the body's vulnerability to various types of depressive disorders, causing sometimes organic changes difficult to quantify and to treat. Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

Ces stimulus étaient l'apomorphine, l'émétine, la scoline et le choc électrique. Rien n'indique à l'évidence que ces méthodes sont plus efficaces que les autres, non excitantes, pour traiter les alcooliques. L'échec de ces méthodes est parfois attribuable à des modes de conditionnement défectueux. Ainsi, (1) la difficulté qu'on éprouve à régler l'intervalle entre la présentation du stimulus conditionné (SC) (alcool) et la survenance du réflexe non conditionné (RNC) (nausée et vomissements). L'intervalle critique (de 0 à 5 secondes) entre le SC et le RNC est d'une extrême importance dans le conditionnement classique; (2) L'effet hypnotique souvent produit par les drogues productrices de nausées, qui peut rendre difficile le processus du conditionnement. Cependant, même lorsqu'un réflexe de répugnance à l'alcool est bien conditionné, il peut ne pas suffire à produire des modifications du comportement chez le buveur. Rien non plus ne vient prouver l'efficacité thérapeutique particulière du LSD.L'auteur met en lumière la difficulté d'évaluation de la plupart des études passées en revue et il expose les conditions minimales qui président à des études bien faites. Il propose d'accorder plus d'attention, dans la future recherche, aux variables que présentent les sujets et les modes d'administration, ainsi qu'aux méthodes de postcure.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

      "abstract": "In order to study some mental disorders due to poisoning by sleeping and sedative drugs 258 patients with mental and boderline conditions (who had taken these drugs in toxic doses) were studied in the Sklifosovskiy Moscow Research Institute of Emergency Medical Aid. The revealed mental disorders on different stages of poisoning were less differentiated in the acute period (clouded consciousness, coma) and most diverse in pre- and postcomatose stages, where they were characterized by disturbed consciousness, hallucinatory and delusional experiences, epileptiformal syndromes, emotional, motor and other disturbances. The symptomatology depended upon the type of medical drug, intensity of medical procedures, the mental or boderline disease itself which influences the clinical picture of every stage of the intoxication.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty of assessing the effects of mind- altering drugs on human behavior, especially conduct in real-life situations, is discussed. Problems in classification of drugs are also noted; it is emphasized that assumed drug effects are, at best, statements of probability. In considering crimes associated with drug use, it is necessary to distinguish between crimes based on drug use itself, which include all offenses for illicit acquisition, possession, and use of dangerous drugs and narcotics, and dangerous behavior resulting from use. The evidence is clearest for alcohol, revealing a distinct relationship between alcohol use and health hazard, suicide, accidents, and violence. The evidence is less clear for heroin, since most users are delinquent prior to being identified as \"addicts\" so that continued criminality after heroin use cannot be \"caused\" by narcotics. That the kind of criminality engaged in is influenced by drug use does seem a reasonable conclusion. Evidence about the degree of risk for the use of other drugs (sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, volatile intoxicants, and the like) and crime is absent. Generally, it appears that most Americans use drugs without major ill- effects—including occasional illicit use. Those likely to be engaged in drug use and in crime are likely to be urban slum- dwelling males, with an overrepresentation of minority groups. Such behavior is apt to be part of a life pattern of deficit and disorder.",

      "title": "Drug-induced cognitive impairment and dementia",
      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric rehabilitation of the chronically mentally ill requires conceptual distinction among psychological abnormalities of the nervous system, representing active pathology or a disease state; impairment of functions by means of which those abnormalities can be inferred; disabilities, i.e., losses of functional ability consequent upon an impairment; and handicaps, which are the social disadvantages resulting from disability [1-3]. These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw.

Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw.

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

Neuroanatomical findings on imaginga. Most consistent finding is ventricular enlargement, especially third and lateral ventriclesb. Selective reduction in size of frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, and limbic regions, including the hippocampus and medial temporal lobec. Possible decrease in volume of neocortical and deep gray matterd. Sulcal widening, especially frontal and temporal areas e.

Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12. Psychosocial intervention strategies a. Emphasis on outpatient treatment b. Partial hospitalization, day treatments, outpatient care c. Family therapy reduces relapse rate d. Self-help organizations e. Cognitive therapy techniques: the goal is to remediatethe abnormal thought processes f. Social skills training: little effect on risk of relapse g.

      "abstract": "Introdução: Cefaleia representa um problema de saúde pública, podendo ser primárias, quando são por si só a patologia ou secundárias quando são apenas um sintoma de uma outra patologia de base. Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use has been associated with several psychiatric comorbidities and there appears to be a dose-response relationship between the intensity and duration of its use and the risk of psychosis. More commonly, acute episodes of cannabis induced-psychosis manifest immediately following exposure, are precipitated after the use of large amounts of cannabis, resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with primary psychotic disorders. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually manifest when heavy, prolonged consumption of this substance is interrupted or significantly reduced. The withdrawal syndrome may include sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reduced appetite. On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare. In this case, we present a 32-year-old healthy woman without personal or family psychiatric history who showed a heavy and continued consumption of cannabis since she was 10 years old, without developing any psychiatric symptoms. However, recently she experienced two brief psychotic episodes with disorganized behavior and persecutory delusions, both episodes happening a week after discontinuing cannabis consumption.",

Caso clínico: Paciente de 31 años sin antecedentes conocidos que debuta con un primer episodio psicótico, no enfermedades conocidas de interés. Consumo diario de cannabis sin especificar cuánto pero en incremento en los meses previos. Niega consumo de otras sustancias, no tiene ningún tratamiento pautado. Nula conciencia de enfermedad de la clínica psicótica ni del trastorno relacionado con el consumo, solicitando durante el ingreso que se le recete cannabis porque es la única medicina que le ayuda. Durante los dos años previos al ingreso se produce una situación de aislamiento progresivo, rompiendo los vínculos sociales y familiares, llegando a dejar de hablar incluso con los convivientes. Durante el ingreso en la unidad de hospitalización breve se realiza coordinación con profesionales de la unidad de conductas adictivas y del centro de rehabilitación psicosocial para un abordaje integral del caso. Conclusiones: En múltiples estudios se ha descrito la asociación entre la aparición de psicosis y el consumo de cannabis, describiéndose como factores que influyen en esta asociación la edad de inicio del consumo y la frecuencia. Así mismo, tanto la psicosis como el consumo de cannabis pueden influir de forma negativa sobre el funcionamiento psicosocial y laboral.

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

There could also be cases of\ninvoluntary internment in the event of the consumption of toxic substances giving rise\nto a mental disorder, which requires prior judicial authorization, except in the event of\ninvolving emergency situations. In this case the competent court should be informed of\nthis as soon as possible, so that any such internment can be ratifi ed.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is defined as five or more of the following symptoms in the past 2 weeks, during which at least one is depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure: depressed mood; diminished interest or pleasure in activities; significant weight loss or gain, or decreased or increased appetite; insomnia or hypersomnia; psychomotor agitation or retardation; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt; poor concentration or indecisiveness; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt. Screening for MDD is recommended in the general adult population when resources are available for diagnosis, management, and follow-up. Several screening tools are available, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC). Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence. Referral to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician should be considered when the diagnosis is in question or when symptoms do not improve with standard treatment.",

The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

It includes a number of somatic drugs (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, opioids, triptans, fingolimod, corticosteroids, antiepileptics, nootropics, antiparkinsonians, denosumab, beta-blockers, laxatives, nasal vasoconstrictors, etc.). This type of unintended effect, often underestimated, generally results from a drug-induced homeostatic imbalance that persists after the drug has been discontinued. Taking this risk into account right from the initial prescription should make it possible to prevent such complications, by encouraging intermittent use of the drug, or by applying a very gradual reduction in dosage when a regular treatment is stopped.",

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

Major variables that will be decisive also include the agreed-upon goals of treatment. The purpose in removing symptoms may include trying to prevent suicide, restoring work and interpersonal function, or enhancing the patient's capacity to participate in psychotherapy. The patient was in an agitated state, overwhelmed by fearful ruminations to the degree that he could not think clearly, or concentrate on anything including his psychotherapy, and had developed early waking insomnia. Many who need psychotherapy will be denied it to avoid short-term cost.

Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties. Scientific opinion has been divided on how broadly to conceive the spectrum of maladaptive behaviors associated with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) (Comings, 1988; Shapiro et al., 1988).",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders specifically associated with stress are exceptional in requiring external events as causes of psychiatric symptoms in order to arrive at a diagnosis. The field is characterised by lively debates, including about the extent to which human suffering should be medicalised and the purportedly inflationary expansion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. The ICD-11 Working Group on this topic was asked to review scientific evidence and other information on use, clinical utility, and experience with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in various health care settings; to review proposals for the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 and consider how these may be suited for global applications; and to assemble proposals for ICD-11 with a focus on improving clinical utility. The Working Group has recommended a separate grouping of 'Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress' for ICD-11, rather than combining them with anxiety disorders as in ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress have two key characteristics: 1) they are identifiable based on psychopathology that differs from other mental disorders; and 2) they arise in specific association with a stressful event or series of events. For each disorder in the grouping, the stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. The stressor may range from negative life events within the normal range of experience (in the case of adjustment disorder) to traumatic stressors of exceptional severity (in the case of PTSD and Complex PTSD).",

Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

In general, antidepressants reduce suicidal ideations in depressive patients. A faster onset of this kind of action in serotonin reuptake inhibitors is not yet completely proved. The hypothesis, described by clinicians, of a specific sociality-increasing risk being associated with a certain group of antidepressants (e.g., antidepressants with a drive-enhancing, non-sedating clinical profile, drugs with a certain biochemical mode of action) has hitherto not been confirmed in control-group studies. An unspecific induction of sociality, observable also under other psychoactive drugs, appears to be quite rare and occurs only under predisposing conditions, such as personality disorders and co medication with other drugs.",

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

People who use cannabis may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after use. Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to a month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment.

The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia.

Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, medical history and course. Determination of alcohol level in the expired air is of limited interest. If low or absent, it should direct clinical investigation toward a disorder having similar symptoms; if high, it does not necessarily explain the clinical picture. The severity of the intoxication must always be assessed carefully. Severity is linked either to a complication of acute alcohol intoxication (coma, inhalation, pneumopathy), or to an associated disorder, observed in 50% of the patients (cranial trauma, drug intoxication). Means of treatment and patient management are simple and well established.",

      "abstract": "Izloženost psihoaktivnim tvarima predstavlja veliki javnozdravstveni problem. Psihoaktivne tvari stvaraju psihicku i fizicku ovisnost. Za psihicku ovisnost je karakteristican osjecaj zadovoljstva i želja za ponovnom konzumacijom droge kako bi se izazvala ugoda. Fizicka ovisnost je stanje izazvano ponavljajucim uzimanjem droge koje zahtjeva njezino kontinuirano uzimanje kako bi se sprijecilo nastajanje neugodnih simptoma apstinencije te kako bi se postiglo djelovanje kakvo je u pocetku izazivala manja kolicina psihoaktivne tvari. Postoji i kombinacija psihicke i fizicke ovisnosti. Ovisnost je kronicna recidivirajuca bolest, koja zahtijeva specijaliziran tretman, dugotrajnu skrb i pracenje. Prema nacinu djelovanja na svijest, razlikujemo: stimulanse, depresante, opioide, halucinogene, nikotin i marihuanu. Najcesce supstance odnosno psihoaktivne tvari koje ovisnik koristi su: opijum, sinteticki opijati-amfetamin, heroin, kokain (crack i list koke) te kanabis. Zlouporaba droga prisutna je u svim dobnim skupinama, a najveci postotak prisutan je kod adolescenata. Neki od razloga posezanja mladih za drogom su nedostatak pravih životih vrijednosti, modernizacija drustva, zanemarivanje od strane roditelja i bliskih osoba, nedovoljna posvecenost drustva, nezrelost, psihicka nestabilnost, znatiželja te velika rasirenost psihoaktivnih tvari. Ovisnik se neprimjereno ponasa, zanemaruje svoje obaveze, mijenja mu se dustveni život i okruženje, gubi prijatelje, dolazi do napetosti i sukoba u obitelji te raskidanja ili narusavanja bliskih veza. Zadatak zdravstvenih djelatnika je predlaganje i provođenje specificnih i konkretnih mjera kako bi se zlouporaba sredstava ovisnosti držala u granicama podnosljivosti za zajednicu. Psihoterapija je metoda koja se koristi za lijecenje ovisnosti. Lijekovi se primjenjuju kao dodatna terapija. Vrlo su cesti recidivi, narocito u drugoj fazi lijecenja u kojoj se ovisnika uci i navikava na život bez droge. Za lijecenje ovisnosti o psihoaktivnim tvarima važan je veliki trud i svakodnevno zalaganje zdravstvenog tima te podrska u grupnim terapijama i podrska obitelji. Programi prevencija ovisnosti trebali bi se provoditi od najranije dobi, pocevsi od vrtica i malih skoli, a posebno bi trebali biti usmjereni na adolescente koji su najugroženija populacija",

      "title": "Understanding The Weak Opioids",
      "abstract": "Abstract When pain is moderate and can’t be controlled by the non-opioid (nonnarcotic) drugs, the next step is to use a weak opioid, of which codeine is the most well known. Like the strong opioids, these drugs typically cause constipation, which can be prevented with laxatives (such as senna [Senokot-S], Metamucil, Milk of Magnesia, Dulcolax, or suppositories), stool softeners (such as Colace), or enemas as needed (see Chapter 10). Nausea and vomiting are also sometimes a side effect, although these side effects usually last only a few days with consistent use of these medications. Although physical dependence (which means withdrawal symptoms would occur if the drug were stopped suddenly) and tolerance (which means that, as the body adapts to the dose, more is needed to achieve the same painrelieving effect) sometimes occur, they are usually not important problems when the weak opioids are used for pain. These drugs are not really ‘‘weak’‘; they are just considered weaker than the ‘‘strong’‘opioids (such as morphine) because their dosage is limited by the other compounds with which they are formulated, such as Tylenol or aspirin. Because the dosing guidelines and side effects are so different for the so-called ‘‘strong’‘opioids, a fuller discussion of their use will be explored in the next chapter.",

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the situation and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

En esta revision, hacemos un repaso del complejo proceso de la cognicion asi como de los distintos elementos que lo integran. Asimismo, revisamos los mecanismos mediante los que el dolor cronico puede afectar el proceso de la cognicion y el modo en el que este puede verse afectado por la concurrencia de otras patologias, o por los farmacos habitualmente utilizados para su tratamiento. Finalmente se plantea la necesidad de evaluar el deterioro cognitivo en los pacientes con dolor cronico, con el objetivo de evitar la progresion de la enfermedad cognitiva hacia un cuadro de deterioro mas grave, asi como de contribuir a mejorar la respuesta terapeutica al dolor y el aumento de la calidad de vida de los pacientes. EnglishChronic pain constitutes a serious public health problem due to its high prevalence and the social and personal consequences. The presence of chronic pain has been associated with mild cognitive impairment, especially in patients with fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, and it has been also related with other disease like anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and the use of certain drugs, usually taken on these patients. This document revises the complex issue of the cognitive process and the several elements that comprise it. Likewise, we review the different mechanisms by which pain affect cognitive process and the way it could be affected by other disease, or by drugs commonly used on treatment. It is necessary to assess mild cognitive impairment on chronic pain patients, in order to prevent the develop and the evolution of cognitive disease to a more severe impairment, as well as help to improve therapeutic response to pain and increase health related quality of life of patients.",

      "abstract": "Aim. We report the case of two young subjects who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during a heavy use of ecstasy. After several months of discontinuation of the drug, major depression with psychotic features developed in one subject and a psychotic disorder in the other individual. No mental disorder preceded the use of ecstasy in any subject. Findings. A familial and personality vulnerability for mental disorder was revealed in one subject, but not in the other, and all physical, laboratory and cerebral NMR evaluations showed normal results in both patients. Remission of OCD and depressive episode or psychotic disorder was achieved after treatment with a serotoninergic medication associated with an antipsychotic. Conclusions. The heavy long-term use of ecstasy may induce an alteration in the brain balance between serotonin and dopamine, which might constitute a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the onset of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and psychotic symptoms. The heavy use of ecstasy probably interacted with a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder in one subject, whereas we cannot exclude that an “ecstasy disorder” ex novo affected the other individual.",

      "title": "New Clinical Implications of Opiate Maintenance Treatments",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor\r\n\r\nOpiate addiction is a chronic mental illness with severe repercussion in personal and public health. Various medicaments have been subjected to research in order to find a proper treatment, methadone is the most and wide used drug, buprenorphine/naloxone is the most recent ones, but other choices have been proposed such as prescribing heroin (1). The mentioned treatments, are considered as maintenance ones, because, the chronic illnesses need a longtime approach. Other possibilities have been studied, for example the detoxification (conventional or ultra-rapid) as well as the use of opiate antagonist as naltrexone. On the other hand, a long period of dis habituation or relapse prevention is required after detoxification of all sorts of addictions, including opiate dependency.\r\n\r\nOn this second phase, psychological therapies are very important, as well as social and family support. Most patients need during dis habituation (of heroin addiction) a preliminary period of opiate maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (2).\r\n\r\nSide effects, as well as notwell-known effects, of drug and treatments are a very interesting goal of research. The hypogonadotrophic effect of opioids can be observed even after the administration of a single opioid dose, both in laboratory animals and in humans (3). Other studies have reported that methadone and buprenorphine are opioids with effects on spermatogenesis (4) and secondary sex organs. It seems probable that these drugs could affect testes volume.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, those effects have quantitative differences depending on the opiate as showed in the paper titled “A quantitative and qualitative study of rat testis following administration of methadone and buprenorphine” (5).\r\n\r\nHeidari et al. observed Buprenorphine treatment is more appropriate for treating opiate addiction in male rats since it does not affect normal testicular structure and function (5). Those results should be considered by all the professionals involved in addictions and their co-morbidities (dual pathology) research projects and treatment, not only because of the consequences of this side effect on sexuality or reproduction, but also how the testosterone deficiency is related to the not well-known effects of opioid maintenance treatments, as its antipsychotic properties or its influence on personality dimensions as reward dependence on opiate dependents type II or antisocial (6).",

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

      "abstract": "A depressão é um dos principais problemas de saúde mental, caracterizada por sintomas como tristeza, desesperança, apatia, indiferença, desinteresse, além de sintomas físicos, como alterações no sono e no apetite. Essa doença pode afetar pessoas de todas as faixas etárias, porém, os idosos requerem uma atenção especial quando comparados às pessoas mais jovens, pelos riscos que os avanços da idade podem trazer. No Brasil, o número de idosos terá um aumento significativo até 2025, tal fato é preocupante, uma vez que pessoas idosas estão mais suscetíveis a algumas doenças, entre elas, a depressão. A depressão é vista como uma das doenças mais impactantes das últimas décadas, podendo levar ao suicídio. As causas se apresentam de forma variada e podem estar ligadas a fatores biológicos, psicológicos ou sociais. Alguns tipos de doenças, como câncer ou doenças infecciosas, abuso de álcool, perdas de pessoas próximas ou bens materiais, bem como o uso de alguns medicamentos também podem causar sintomas depressivos. O tratamento pode ser feito através de psicoterapia e de medicamentos, os quais passaram por um processo significativo de evolução no decorrer dos anos. Cabe ao farmacêutico, realizar o acompanhamento farmacoterapêutico dos pacientes, garantindo a sua segurança e orientando-os quanto ao uso correto dos medicamentos. No presente trabalho, objetivou-se analisar dados referentes à depressão em pessoas idosas, tendo como foco principal, os tipos de tratamentos disponíveis, assim como os riscos que um antidepressivo pode oferecer à saúde de um idoso. Para o desenvolvimento do estudo, foi feita uma pesquisa bibliográfica qualitativa e descritiva na literatura disponível, acerca dos pontos de maior relevância dentro do tema. A partir das informações obtidas, foi possível concluir que a atenção e capacitação dos profissionais da saúde são imprescindíveis na qualidade do atendimento ao paciente, assim como o cuidado no momento da prescrição do medicamento, já que alguns destes podem causar danos à saúde.",

Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "Psychosocial therapies in addictive disorders",
      "abstract": "Substance use disorders form a significant part of global disease burden. With the increasing trend of use of psychoactive substances, the detrimental effects associated with it also increases. Individuals with substance use disorders are heterogeneous with respect to a number of clinically important features and domains of functioning. The pathophysiology of these addictive disorders is complex, not always linear and can be described as a complex bio-psycho-social process, coordinated by the neurological, vascular and endocrine systems. Apart from these biological factors psychological, physiological, environmental, and cultural factors are also invariably associated with use of a particular substance, and may have an independent intervening effect on the patient's overall quality of life and long term outcomes. Care of individuals with substance use disorders includes conducting a complete assessment, treating intoxication and withdrawal syndromes when necessary, addressing co-occurring psychiatric and general medical conditions, the achievement of abstinence or reduction in the use and effects of the substance, reduction in the frequency and severity of relapse to substance use, and improvement in psychological and social functioning, developing and implementing an overall treatment plan. Methods of intervention for achieving the above objectives vary from pharmacological to behavioral or psychosocial and from singular specific therapies to a broad array of services within a program. The role of psychosocial interventions has been especially underutilized and under studied in this patient population. Treatment services have been developed to address not only the substance use, but also the range of other problems that often predate, co-occur with, and are caused by these substance use disorders. These issues can include family or social relationships, legal matters, job or vocational concerns, medical conditions, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Identifying the magnitude of these problems and managing them effectively may have a significant impact on the prevention of relapse. The importance of developing best practices and clinical guidelines in this area is therefore essential. The essential concepts underlying the management of addiction and related disorders are adoption of a patient-centered framework for evaluation and treatment. As in other areas of health-care, increasing attention is now being focused on providing evidence-based care for persons with substance use disorders and in this context there has been significant progress in the development and standardization of psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders. Psychosocial treatments are now considered essential components to any comprehensive substance use disorder treatment program. Principles of evidence-based medicine may be followed in both men and women in diagnostic and treatment planning and adoption of common psychosocial management approaches for these disorders. They can be implemented individually or in groups and delivered by a range of health workers. Psychosocial treatments are considered to be the foundation of drug and alcohol treatment, especially for substances where pharmacological treatments have not been sufficiently evaluated. The highlights of this book includes a comprehensive overview of the various psychosocial assessment tools, intervention strategies, the efficacy of a community based approach as well as the use of innovative approaches such as digital technology in formulating an adequate psychosocial management approach. There is a need for research on psychological interventions in special populations such as adolescents, the geriatric population, poly drug misuser, those with medical comorbidities, people with psychiatric comorbidity and other specific groups like LGBT, the tribal population and those with physical impairments. The recent literature regarding the same has been highlighted in this book. Maintaining the ethical frame is paramount in the therapy room and this extends to any intervention research which involves human participants. The chapter on ethics examines the debates and recommendations concerning key ethical issues in research on psychotherapy and various psychosocial interventions. Healthy family interaction and regular treatment follow up with support of family has proved to be the major protective factors of abstinence after treatment. These family based interventions would promote the quality of social support to the individual and it has been documented that social support when supplemented with effective community based interventions is a crucial factor in recovery. These guidelines outline this very model and addresses the importance of training primary health care doctors, NGO staff, volunteers, counselors, college & school teachers, strengthening self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in case identification, diagnosis, referral to treatment, providing long term care and rehabilitation services of patients with addiction disorders.. We hope that these guidelines would help in facilitating proper management of patients presenting with various types of substance use disorders and that the information provided will be of interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare professionals.",

      "title": "Care for addiction through Ayurveda",
      "abstract": "The term addiction commonly used for drug addiction is uncontrolled use of alcohol, nicotine, opiates, heroine and other psychoactive substances. Apart from this some times it is also used for other compulsions. These unwholesome substances or bad habits are the remote causes for several others diseases. These bad habits are harmful for health but sudden discontinuation of these again produces some discomforts or diseases. These are known as withdrawal symptoms like cravings, irritability, insomnia, depression and anorexia, etc. Instead of withdrawal therapy, Ayurveda mentioned an attractive, logical, replacement therapy. It means unwholesome substances or bad habits should be replaced by good one, which is more constructive. The replacement therapy which should be very systematical and gradual is known as Satmyikarana process in Ayurveda. Satmya means suitability to some things, which are favourable for one’s own self. Satmyam nama yad yadatmanyupaseta (CS Vi-1/20). On the other hand, the substance that is unfavorable for one’s own self is known as Asatmya. Asatmyamiti tadvidyadyanna yati sahatmyatam (CS Sa-1/127). Satmya and Asatmya are also known as Upashaya and Anupashaya, respectively. Hita and pathya are frequently used as synonyms for Satmya and their antonym for Asatmya. Satmyikarana is a procedure of adaptation by gradual and logical giving up of Asatmya substance, on the other hand layer by layer acceptance of Satmya substance. In another word, making foreign substance homologous to body is also known as Satmyikarana. When persons are habituated to any unwholesome substances they feel happy with that. Absence of it creates emptiness or discomfort. Instead of being left blank, filling the blanks with another good one is more constructive. Administration of wholesome substances in this specific way may helps to avoid addictive stimulus and exhibit a healthier way to quench the thirst. It resists the appearance of withdrawal symptoms.",

      "title": "Other Uses: Psychosis, Pregnancy, and Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Although ECT was developed as a treatment for schizophrenia, its ease of use, its safety, and the lack of effective treatments for many psychiatric conditions encouraged experimentation with this therapy to treat other disorders. These explorations define a cluster of conditions— acute and chronic psychosis, psychiatric disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period, and intractable seizure disorders—in which ECT has a clinical role. Strongly held beliefs (delusions), abnormal sensory experiences (hallucinations, illusions) that are not based upon reality, and beliefs that others are paying special attention or plotting harm to the subject (paranoid thoughts) impair social functioning and disrupt family life. Thought disorders are the central peculiarity of schizophrenia but are also frequently found in patients with depression, mania, toxic states, and brain disorders. Regardless of the cause or the associated signs and symptoms, treatment can reduce the psychosis. This benefit is often given small notice, however, because ECT is widely regarded as an antidepressant, not an antipsychotic, treatment. The relief of psychosis afforded by ECT varies with the underlying condition. Disorders in thought in patients with depression or mania are readily relieved. Indeed, the more severe form of psychotic depression is relieved more rapidly than nonpsychotic depression. When ECT is used to treat patients with malignant catatonia and delirium, the psychosis is relieved at the same time as the toxic state. When psychosis dominates the clinical condition without other features, schizophrenia is the usual diagnosis. For acute schizophrenia dominated by the positive symptoms of paranoia, catatonia, or excitement, ECT is quite helpful. It is not helpful for the chronic varieties dominated by passivity and withdrawal, the negative signs of the illness. The clinical approach to the diagnosis of a psychotic condition is to exclude other causes for psychosis first and reserve the label “schizophrenia” for the residue of “not otherwise diagnosed” psychotic conditions. While we are able to ameliorate the psychoses in mood disorders and toxic states, palliation and symptom reduction are the best that we can offer other psychotic patients. Electroconvulsive therapy and insulin coma therapy were the main treatments for psychosis at the time when Thorazine and other new antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1950s.",

Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

      "abstract": "A broad spectrum of pathological gamblers (N = 222) were queried with regard to physical symptoms when attempting to slow down or stop gambling. Results were compared with a control group of substance‐dependent patients who gambled at least casually. Sixty‐five percent of the pathological gamblers (vs. only 2% of controls) experienced at least one of the following: insomnia (50%), headaches (36%), upset stomach or diarrhea (34%), loss of appetite (29%), physical weakness (27%), heart racing or palpitations (26%), shaking (19%), muscle aches or cramps (17%), difficulty breathing (13%), sweating (12%), and chills or fever (6.5%). In addition, 91% experienced “cravings'and 87% felt “restless and irritable'when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Contrary to expectations, none of the symptoms correlated with gender, type of gambling, extent of alcohol or drug use while gambling, or self‐described alcoholism or drug addiction. Symptoms did correlate with number of hours spent gambling, severity of the problem as measured by proposed DSM‐IV criteria, and presence of dissociation.",

      "abstract": "The gustatory system is responsible for four basic taste experiences: salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. A fifth quality, called umami, has been postulated to describe the taste of monosodium glutamate and related compounds (Rolls et al., 1998). However, these taste bud-mediated sensations should not be confused with flavor sensations like coffee, chocolate, strawberry, lemon, steak sauce, barbeque sauce, etc., which are mediated via the olfactory system. During deglutition, volatiles from foodstuffs or drinks stimulate the olfactory receptors retronasally (i.e., through the nasopharynx), imparting such sensations. Additional components of flavor include texture, temperature, oral irritation, pungentness, and other somatosensory sensations. Although many of these interrelated components of flavor can be impaired or distorted following traumatic cranial nerve or brain injury, nasal or oral trauma, and surgical or medical therapies, such impairment is extremely rare. In general, most \"taste\" losses reflect damage to the olfactory system (see Chapters 22, 30, and 44).",

In 11% of the patients the \"on-off\" effect was studied (brisk alteranting Parkinsonic and improved states). Clinical observation during 14 hours a day was repeated with different dosages and different regimes of the drug; these modified the daily variations but did not eliminate the syndrome. The electromyographic studies also revealed the \"on and off\" phenomenon in different patients. When the \"long-term syndrome\" is severe, at times it is necessary to stop the drug; the secondary effects are thus decreased and, when the medication is given again, the therapeutic effectiveness is temporarily restored. When the drug is stopped the patients should be watched, since a \"withdrawal syndrome\" may appear.",

The exact cause of depression isn't fully understood, even though biological factors like imbalance in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine play a significant role. Psychological factors, such as trauma, chronic stress, low self-esteem, and negative thinking patterns, can contribute to the development and exacerbation of depression. Diagnosis of depression involves assessing persistent feelings of sadness or loss of interest in daily activities, along with other accompanying symptoms, lasting for at least two weeks. Depression is a treatable condition, which may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy), medication (such as antidepressants), and lifestyle changes.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

What makes a dying patient uncomfortable or causes them suffering must be determined and appropriately treated. The assessment should include the following questions: Is the patient experiencing physiological pain? Is the discomfort caused by psychological, emotional, or spiritual distress (suffering)? Or is there a particular distressing symptom that needs to be identified and appropriately treated? Medicine and nursing practice are based on the assessment and treatment of disease and symptoms.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

The disease called alcoholism (sedativism) consists, however, of much more than just a chronic or periodic addiction to a sedative drug. The urgent need to understand the psychological and societal parameters of this illness is underscored by the likelihood that alcoholism represents the major factor in the cause of death of young adults ( less than 45 years) in the United States today. Its further role as a carcinogen is only recently achieving adequate examination.",

Descriptions of the symptoms, as we have described throughout this book, and as spelled out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), serve as the point of departure—symptoms that are not just fleeting, but recurrent or persistent. The symptoms must also not be occurring exclusively and only in the context of some other condition, be it psychiatric, medical, or related to substance use. If, for example, the depersonalization happened only when the person was deeply depressed, or during a panic attack, or a seizure, or because a person has a brain tumor, he or she would not be diagnosed as having DPD. Likewise, regular substance users (daily drinkers or marijuana users) who experience depersonalization only in that context would not be diagnosed with DPD.",

      "abstract": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in the hours or days after the cessation of alcohol drinking in an alcohol dependent patient. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

The purpose of this brief review is to acquaint clinical neurologists with recent developments in what is basically a neurobiologic problem.

      "abstract": "Functional selectivity is the term that describes drugs that cause markedly different signaling through a single receptor (e.g., full agonist at one pathway and antagonist at a second). It has been widely recognized recently that this phenomenon impacts the understanding of mechanism of action of some drugs, and has relevance to drug discovery. One of the clinical areas where this mechanism has particular importance is in the treatment of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs have been grouped according to both pattern of clinical action and mechanism of action. The original antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been called typical or first generation. They cause both antipsychotic actions and many side effects (extrapyramidal and endocrine) that are ascribed to their high affinity dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism. Drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and others were then developed that avoided the neurological side effects (atypical or second generation antipsychotics). These compounds are divided mechanistically into those that are high affinity D(2) and 5-HT(2A) antagonists, and those that also bind with modest affinity to D(2), 5-HT(2A), and many other neuroreceptors. There is one approved third generation drug, aripiprazole, whose actions have been ascribed alternately to either D(2) partial agonism or D(2) functional selectivity. Although partial agonism has been the more widely accepted mechanism, the available data are inconsistent with this mechanism. Conversely, the D(2) functional selectivity hypothesis can accommodate all current data for aripiprazole, and also impacts on discovery compounds that are not pure D(2) antagonists.",

According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

Positive symptoms refer to abnormal or hyperactive mental functions, including abnormal sensations (visual and auditory hallucinations), delusions, confused thoughts, disorganized speech and behavior, etc. Negative symptoms refer to reduced or absent mental functions, including lack of motivation, lack of pleasure, social withdrawal, reduced willpower, etc. Cognitive deficits include impaired attention, decline in executive function and working memory, etc. Although the use of chlorpromazine in 1950 cured or alleviated the psychiatric symptoms of most SCZ patients, there were still 20% of the patients who were drug-resistant or dissatisfied with psychotropic treatments. So far, SCZ treatment mainly includes medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychotherapy, and rTMS treatment.",

Not surprisingly, because of the illegality of these substances, many of these individuals die while in the custody of law enforcement. In fact, forensic pathologists have often divided these drug-related custody deaths into four different categories: (a) death during arrest and transport or soon thereafter; (b) death within 12 hours of arrest: (c) death after 12 hours, but within a few days to weeks; and (d) death after days to weeks of incarceration (2). Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

The more serious the substance problem, the more likely there are to be associated psychological, physical and social problems, which require a more intensive level of treatment intervention. Psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders are associated with the direct intoxicating effects of acute and chronic substance misuse and withdrawal syndromes, often within an inhospitable social environment. There is an increased risk of traumatic injury resulting in hospitalization among substance users. An awareness of and a high index of suspicion about drug use must pervade all aspects of practice, especially assessment. Pharmacotherapy is available for opiates, alcohol and nicotine. Substance users are heterogeneous, no single approach is universally effective, and evaluation of treatment outcome should be multidimensional.",

Drugs causing intoxications can in general be divided into three groups: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Opioids act through a mu receptor present in the central nervous system. Drugs like dilaudid, morphine, methadone, and heroin all belong to the opioid family. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their activity on the postsynaptic membrane. Withdrawal from marijuana presents with mild symptoms or irritability, depression, insomnia, nausea, and anorexia. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance. Intoxication presentation may vary and include talkative, flirtatious, aggressive, moody, or disinhibited behaviors. Intoxicated patients may not be competent enough to make reasonable decisions in terms of their medical care as well as pose a potential danger to self and others.",

Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

The authors review certain exogenous factors that seem capable of triggering attacks and/or increasing their frequency and intensity: self-administered pharmacologic agents (caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, over-the-counter cold preparations, cannabis, cocaine); habits (sleep deprivation, diet, exercise, relaxation, hyperventilation); and aspects of the environment (fluorescent lighting, life stressors). There may be a specificity to the action of some of these factors, because certain factors previously thought to trigger panic attacks (e.g., pain, hypoglycemia) have been proved not to have this effect. Although the clinical significance of many of the exogenous factors discussed still awaits empirical confirmation, attention to such factors during the initial evaluation of a patient with panic disorder may be helpful in formulating a successful treatment plan.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between suicidality and substance abuse has long been recognized, although studies have only fairly recently begun to identify factors that may help clarify how alcohol or other drug abuse increases the susceptibility to suicidal behavior in vulnerable populations. In particular, alcohol and other psychoactive substance misuse has been linked with mood destabilization and the induction of manic or depressive episodes in affectively ill individuals, while also demarcating groups with heightened tendencies toward impulsivity, aggression, and sensitivity to interpersonal loss. Serotonergic mechanisms have been implicated in each of these clinical settings, along with possible dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Psychosocial aspects of alcohol or drug abuse relevant to suicide may involve a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal loss, poor coping skills in response to adverse life events, and affective dysregulation induced by circadian and psychosocial stresses. Consequently, self-destructive behaviors with relatively little premeditation may arise during periods of increased stress, intoxication, depression, or other psychopathology. Early detection of substance abuse followed by appropriate pharmacologic and/or psychotherapeutic interventions may greatly help to minimize the formation of complex comorbid psychiatric conditions and reduce the potential for suicidal acts among high-risk populations.",

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Catatonia",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a range of psychomotor abnormalities. It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractNumerous psychiatric disorders are hypothetically linked to a vulnerable genome that can trigger illness when meeting adverse environmental experiences. Some disorders may be more highly biologically endowed, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, whereas others may be more strongly linked to environmental exposure, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, medical and cardiac complications of stress, substance abuse, and chronic pain. Currently, our therapeutic approach to psychiatric disorders is largely to wait until symptoms are overtly expressed and, once symptoms interfere with social or occupational functioning, to treat them, usually reducing but not removing symptoms.",

Ceux qui s'étaient entaillés le poignet étaient plus jeunes et leurs actes étaient d'une létalité plus faible. Ils sont peu susceptibles d'avoir déjà posé des gestes suicidaires. Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation. La réaction typique est la suivante: une fois la blessure infligée, et après une période de dépersonnalisation suivit de détente et de repersonnalisation provoquée par le saignement, le patient n'éprouve aucune douleur.",

Their proximity is an indicator of the closeness of the classification of the two disorders. Dissociation is often part of the response to trauma. Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse.

      "abstract": "Objective: To discuss a case of synthethic marijuana use and subsequent withdrawal phenomenon that clinically resulted in PRES. Background: In the last decade synthetic marijuana has emerged as a new drug of abuse. Synthetic marijuana is colloquial known as “Spice,” which is typically composed of herbs, spices and other plant matter that are sprayed with at least one synthetic cannabinoid. They have diverse chemicals that are structurally distinct from THC. Given the heterogeneity of chemical composition, the intoxication effects are diverse. The presence of a withdrawal phenomenon following chronic use and clinical sequeale are not explored in the literature to date. Design/Methods: We discuss a case presentation of acute intoxication, withdrawal phenomenology and subsequent neurological complications of synthetic marijuana usage including PRES. Results: A 26yo man was found by police and paramedics to be confused and combative after he had smoked synthetic cannabinoids earlier in the evening. He was restrained by police and brought to the emergency department where he was noted to be febrile, combative and confused with normal heart rate and blood pressure. He had an unremarkable initial head computed tomography (CT) image. His labs were significant for hypernatremia, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. His LP showed no xanthochromia or pleocytosis. On days 2–4 of the hospitalization he exhibited autonomic instability following withdrawal of his daily consumption of synthetic marijuana. A MRI was eventually obtained following 8 days in the hospital because of unresolved encephalopathy. It showed evidence of PRES, right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), small bilateral cortical and corpus collosum hemorrhages and superior cerebellar vermis subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT angiogram (CTA) showed no evidence of vasospasm or vasoconstriction or aneurysm. Conclusions: Our patient exhibited withdrawal phenomenon following 2 days cessation of daily synthetic marijuana. Clinically the patient exhibited autonomic instability and poor mentation resulting radiographically in PRES, ICH and SAH. Disclosure: Dr. Stack has nothing to disclose.",

      "abstract": "The detrimental physical, mental and social effects of substance misuse in older adults are of growing concern. Rates of use and misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs among older cohorts are rising, influenced in part by the attitudes of the 'baby boomer' generation. Additionally, those over the age of 60 are significant users of health and social care resources and receive the most prescription medications, with addiction forming analgesics and sedatives commonly used. Unfortunately, sometimes identification of substance abuse problems, particularly in older people can be difficult. Continuing obstacles to identification include poor clinical and patient insight, societal taboos, inadequate screening tools and atypical symptoms on presentation. Nonspecific complaints, such as memory loss, falls, incontinence, self-neglect and low mood, may precipitate initial contact with frontline healthcare services. They can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, not just the effects of medication, alcohol and other substances, and, if untreated, can have a devastating impact on lives. This chapter aims to describe the challenges of substance abuse in older people for modern clinical medicine, clarify some of the physical effects experienced by those affected, concentrating on the so-called 'geriatric giants' and identify some of the potential avenues through which the identification and care of those at risk can be improved.",

In general, the term \"\"alcohol\"\" in our language refers to all intoxicating and alcohol-containing beverages. The use of alcohol dates back to ancient times in human history. Often preferred for its pleasurable effects, the repeated and prolonged use of alcohol can lead to addiction. The World Health Organization defines an alcohol addict as \"\"a person who consumes alcohol for an extended period and in atypical amounts, whose mental, physical, and social health deteriorates due to alcohol, who cannot assess their condition, and even if they can, cannot stop the desire to consume alcohol, and who requires treatment.\"\" Currently, the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder are established by the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). Studies have shown that alcohol use disorder often does not occur in isolation but is accompanied by other psychiatric disorders. The co-occurrence of another psychiatric disorder with alcohol addiction is referred to as comorbidity. Some psychiatric disorders that may co-occur with alcohol dependence include anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and mood disorders. In this context, this chapter will address alcohol use disorder from both conceptual and legal perspectives, and examine its relationship with other psychiatric disorders, along with the frequency of their co-occurrence.",

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode.

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: how to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat it.",
      "abstract": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

      "title": "[Mechanism of nicotine dependence].",
      "abstract": "This article reviews the current studies on the mechanism of nicotine dependence. In the process of nicotine dependence, there are four major determinants: reinforcing effects, tolerance, craving and withdrawal. 1) The positive reinforcing effects of nicotine are important especially for the initiation of nicotine self-administration. These effects are considered to be induced by the ability of nicotine to promote the release of catecholamines, acetylcholine, beta-endorphine, glucocorticoid, and other kinds of hormones. 2) However, tolerance gradually develops to the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine, as nicotine is repeatedly self-administered. 3) Craving is defined as the uncontrollability of the urge to take drugs, which is a core aspect of recent ICD-10 or DSM-IV descriptions. Craving for nicotine is caused and enhanced by the following three factors; psychic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression and dysphoria, conditioning processes leading to the association of nicotine effects with environmental stimuli, and memory of the reinforcing effects of nicotine. 4) Neither somatic withdrawal symptoms nor mental disorders related to nicotine dependence is significant. 5) As for the neurobiology of nicotine dependence, the reward system is focused as a putative responsible region involved not only in the reinforcing effects of nicotine but also in the psychic withdrawal symptoms. The amygdala-nucleus accumbens connection may be intimately involved in the association between nicotine effects and environmental stimuli. And neuronal circuits involved in memory function may be implicated in the manifestation of craving and relapse, but the details remain to be solved.",

These disorders are part of a larger group of substance-related disorders defined by 10 classes of psychoactive substances, including alcohol. The following conditions are classified as alcohol-induced: Alcohol Intoxication, Alcohol Withdrawal, and Other Alcohol-Induced Mental Disorders.

La presencia de sintomas aislados, que afectan al 20% de la poblacion general, no es suficiente para establecer el diagnostico de depresion pero si que alerta sobre la existencia de una depresion subclinica o una trastorno depresivo emergente. En el diagnostico precoz de la depresion, a parte de los sintomas, deben tenerse en CUenta otros factores, como la personalidad (los trastornos de personalidad predisponen al padecimiento de depresiones no endogenas), los antecedentes personales (el indice de recaidas de las depresiones es muy elevado), los antecedentes familiares (trastornos afectivos, alcoholismo, trastornos de personalidad) y los desencadenantes (acontecimientos de vida negativos en los meses previos a la aparicion de un trastorno depresivo). En muchas ocasiones el diagnostico no es facil, ya que los limites entre la depresion y la normalidad (tristeza normal) y otros trastornos psiquicos como la ansiedad no son precisos. EnglishA diagnosis of depression is based on confirming a set of symptoms distributed among various areas: affectivity, thought process-cognition, behavior, biological rhythms and somatic disorders. lsolated symptoms, which affect 20% of the general population, are insufficient for establishing a diagnosis of depression but may warn of subclinical depression or an emerging depressive disorder. Among factors other than symptoms that should be taken into account for the early diagnosis of depression are personality (personality disorders that predispose an individual to non-endogenic depression), personal history (the rate of relapse is very high), family history (affective disorders, alcoholism, personality disorders) and triggers (negative l,ife events in the months leading up to the appearance of depression). Diagnosis is often difficult, given that the line between depression and normality (normal sadness) and other psychological disorders such as anxiety are imprecise. catalaEl diagnostic de la depressio es basa en la constatacio d'un conjunt de simptomes distribuits en diferents arees: afectivitat, pensament-cognicio, conducta, ritmes biologics i trastorns somatics.

The disorder may manifest with challenging behaviors such as school refusal, temper tantrums, or somatic complaints. Worries typically center around fear of untoward events that may occur when separated from loved ones, such as accidents, kidnapping, or death. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the initial treatment of choice for separation anxiety disorder. Pharmacotherapy including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used as an adjunct to behavioral or psychotherapeutic interventions.",

CFS is a condition of unknown etiology that presents with a complex array of symptoms in patients with diverse health histories. A diagnosis of CFS is largely dependent upon ruling out other organic and psychologic causes of fatigue. CFS can present the clinician with a unique set of challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment. A review of recent research suggests that the management of CFS requires an individualized approach for each patient. An historic overview of the condition is presented along with current theories of causation, diagnosis considerations, symptom management, and health promotion strategies.",

MHs are characterized by perception of melodies, music, or songs. AHs/MHs can be associated with hypoacusis, psychiatric or neurological diseases, intoxication and adverse reactions of different medications (e.g., propranolol, amantadine, voriconazole).The authors present a case of a 77-year-old male with advanced heart failure, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillations and moderate hypoacusis, who mistakenly overdosed oral amiodarone (6 pills 200 mg each daily within 3 days). After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever. Amiodarone is known to seldom cause neurological or mental complications; however, MHs after the drug have never been reported so far.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "title": "Alteraciones estructurales de las regiones cerebrales sexuales tras empleo de paroxetina versus agomelatina",
      "abstract": "El estado de animo del individuo es un tono vital interno dominante y mantenido, que influye en el comportamiento de la persona y en su percepcion del mundo. Este puede verse normal o eutimico, elevado o hipertimico; bajo o deprimido. Las alteraciones de la esfera afectiva son un grupo de afecciones clinicas que se caracterizan por la perdida de ese sentido del control y por el sentimiento subjetivo de un gran malestar. (SINTOMAS) Los pacientes con animo deprimido experimentan una perdida de energia y del interes, sentimientos de culpa, dificultades de concentracion, perdida del apetito, pensamientos de muerte… entre otros sintomas. Los trastornos del espectro depresivo, cuentan actualmente con una extensa farmacopea, centrados fundamentalmente por los psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos. Tanto el propio deterioro animico asi como su tratamiento pueden traer consigo un sintoma adicional, la disfuncion sexual (DS). Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables. RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION A MICROSCOPIO OPTICO .-Sistema dopaminergico: descenso marcado y global en todo el sistema dopaminergicos (desde origenes hasta destinos) en los animales tratadados con Paroxetina comparado con los animales tratados con Agomelatina y los animales control; que fue objetivado mediante el tratamiento estadistico de los datos obtenidos a traves del programa de procesamiento digital ImageJ. .-Sistema oxcitocinergico: no se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de estudio .-Sistema receptor alfa de estrogeno: se observa descenso de RE alfa en la pars tuberalis de los animales tratados con Agomelatina.",

      "abstract": "This chapter traces the evolution of the term ‘addiction’ over time, demonstrating how its meaning has altered in the face of social and political changes in society. The second half explores the story behind the diagnostic terminology used in clinical practice today, and describes the recent changes to the addiction section of the major classificatory systems. Addiction is conceptualised as a disorder involving a loss of the normal flexibility of human behaviour, leaving a dehumanised state of compulsive behaviour (‘overwhelming involvement’). It has acquired a variety of terminology over time, much of it inferring moral weakness. Addiction may be associated with psychoactive substances or other pleasurable behaviours and occurs on a spectrum of use and harms, which vary in severity. The term ‘dependence’ may refer to physiological aspects of addiction (tolerance or withdrawal), but is also used to define the severe end of the spectrum. Confusion around this terminology has led to it being removed from the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5).",

She was thoroughly evaluated by her primary care physician and referred to both, otorhinolaryngology and pulmonology, with an exhaustively negative workup. Her dysphonia persisted for 13 months and only improved after she abstained from using SC. Conclusions and Significance: We could find no previous cases of dysphonia or hoarseness attributed t SC use/ abuse in the literature and is yet another kind of health sequelae frontline providers should look for in chronic users of SC. The previously unrecognized relationship between SC and dysphonia demonstrates our limited understanding of the chemicals’ adverse effects. Just as nicotine affects the larynx and causes dysphonia and laryngeal carcinoma, this case also raises the question of whether the chemical composition of SC affects the larynx in the same way and its use leads to an increased risk of laryngeal cancer for users/abusers",

The extrapyramidal symptoms include acute dyskinesias and dystonic reactions, tardive dyskinesia, Parkinsonism, akinesia, akathisia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Extrapyramidal symptoms are caused by dopamine blockade or depletion in the basal ganglia; this lack of dopamine often mimics idiopathic pathologies of the extrapyramidal system. Less recognized is that extrapyramidal symptoms are also associated with certain nonantipsychotic agents, including some antidepressants, lithium, various anticonvulsants, antiemetics and, rarely, oralcontraceptive agents. Extrapyramidal symptoms caused by these agents are indistinguishable from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Clinicians must be able to recognize these side effects and be able to determine the antipsychotic-induced and nonantipsychotic causes of extrapyramidal symptoms.",

Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations. One of the factors that increase the level of alcohol consumption is sex, young age, aggression, anxiety, sweating, and depression.

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "title": "Clinical Relevance of Cannabis Tolerance and Dependence",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Psychoactive drugs are often widely used before tolerance and dependence is fully appreciated. Tolerance to cannabis‐induced cardiovascular and autonomic changes, decreased intraocular pressure, sleep and sleep EEG, mood and behavioral changes is acquired and, to a great degree, lost rapidly with optimal conditions. Mechanisms appear more functional than metabolic. Acquisition rate depends on dose and dose schedule. Dependence, manifested by withdrawal symptoms after as little as 7 days of THC administration, is characterized by irritability, restlessness, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, sweating, salivation, increased body temperature, altered sleep and waking EEG, tremor, and weight loss. Mild and transient in the 120 subjects studied, the syndrome was similar to sedative drug withdrawal. Tolerance to drug side effects can be useful. Tolerance to therapeutic effects or target symptoms poses problems. Clinical significance of dependence is difficult to assess since drug‐seeking behavior has many determinants. Cannabis‐induced super sensitivity should be considered wherever chronic drug administration is anticipated in conditions like epilepsy, glaucoma or chronic pain. Cannabis pharmacology suggests ways of minimizing tolerance and dependence problems.",

      "title": "Ketamine for Depression, 1: Clinical Summary of Issues Related to Efficacy, Adverse Effects, and Mechanism of Action",
      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this analysis was to highlight the significance of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive mood disorders in older adults, as well as to expand the knowledge of social educators and geragogists regarding the basic symptoms of depression. Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

In dysphoric patients the drugs have a broad-spectrum effect not only reducing phobias and rituals but also anxiety-depression, panic, anger, and hostility, all of which are highly intercorrelated, but none yet demonstrated to be the core disturbance. Phobics, but not obsessive-compulsives, have an unusually high dropout rate from treatment when drugs or placebo are given. When antidepressants are stopped, even after 6–8 months, relapse is likely. The drugs do not reduce the liability of many phobics and obsessive-compulsives to have dysphoric episodes over the years. Exposure treatments are more lastingly effective for phobias and for rituals, but do not reduce the liability to later dysphoric episodes.",

Substance-induced disorders, particularly for depression and anxiety, include intoxication and withdrawal, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Importantly, DSM-5 criteria indicate that diagnoses for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder cannot be made if there is a substance, such as opioid medications, responsible for the condition. Often the way to distinguish between a substanceinduced disorder and an independent major depressive or anxiety disorder is to discontinue the opioid medications. Given that opioids are not efficacious for long-term prescribing, discontinuation of the medication is the treatment of choice.",

Symptoms consist in the compulsion to move the lower limbs caused by unspecified unpleasant sensations. This disorder is difficult to diagnose because it imitates other diseases. For this reason, differential diagnosis plays a large role in diagnosis. In the case of a slight exacerbation of symptoms, non-pharmacological activities are used, such as improving the conditions of falling asleep, avoiding intense work at the computer just before bedtime, stimulants (coffee, strong tea), energy drinks. Pharmacological treatment should be introduced if the symptoms are more severe. Pharmacotherapy depends on the nature of the symptoms. In the recurrent form, the drug of choice is the lowest effective dose of levodopa. In chronic forms, we permanently use drugs from the group of dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) or so-called gabapentinoid (gabapentin, pregabalin).",

After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) is the psychoactive agent in the leaves of marijuana plants; a number of synthetic cannabinoids have also been recently developed which are more potent. Marijuana users may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after using marijuana; synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Regular users may experience drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness with cessation of use. Serious medical complications are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users, and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or cut down on use. There are no medications that have been shown to be effective for cannabinoid use disorders.",

      "title": "Post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome",
      "abstract": "Central anticholinergic syndrome is defined as an absolute or relative reduction in cholinergic activity in the central nervous system [1]. In anaesthetic practice the syndrome was originally described in connection with drugs with central anticholinergic actions, such as hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) [2]. Later, many other drugs with no direct anticholinergic effects were implicated. This may be by modulation of other neurotransmitters which reduce cholinergic activity, but the mechanisms by which the syndrome occurs have not been fully explained [1]. The reported clinical features of the central anticholinergic syndrome in the post-operative period are non-specific. If they are all components of the syndrome the central nervous system would be widely involved (Table 1). There are said to be two forms of the syndrome: hyperactive or depressed. Peripheral anticholinergic symptoms may also occur but could by masked by peripheral cholinesterase inhibitors. Diagnosis rests on clinical features, exclusion of other conditions, and a positive response to a centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor, usually physostigmine [1].Table 1: Reported clinical features of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome The incidence of the post-operative syndrome has been estimated as 9.4% after general anaesthesia and 3.3% after regional anaesthesia with sedation [1], although an incidence as high as 40% has been claimed [5]. In their paper in this issue of the journal [6], Link et al. report an incidence of 1.9% in a broad mix of 962 adults after general anaesthesia, with a subgroup of women recovering from major gynaecological surgery having an incidence of 10%. These figures are in stark contrast with experience in the UK where central anticholinergic syndrome is diagnosed rarely. United Kingdom anaesthetists are either unaware of the syndrome, or do not believe it exists. Choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs may be an important determinant of reported incidence. Anaesthetists who use long acting drugs (benzodiazepines or barbiturates) will see a large number of patients who recover slowly from anaesthesia. Link et al. state that less than 3% of their study population were given droperidol as part of their anaesthetic, but eight of 18 patients with the syndrome received between 2.5 and 25 mg. The total number of patients given diazepam and phenobarbitone premedication is not stated, but nine of 18 affected patients received one of these drugs. What constitutes normal recovery from anaesthesia and a definition of what is abnormally prolonged are not stated. Clearly, the earlier that features of the syndrome are sought the higher will be their incidence in the post-operative period. Interindividual variations in anaesthetic drugs and technique, as well as variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, must also be taken into account. From the clinical features it is obvious that the list of differential diagnoses is long. As there is no diagnostic test, the diagnosis is made by exclusion of hypoxia, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, hypothermia, urea and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and neurological disturbance from surgery, vascular disease or trauma [1]. The extensive list of symptoms and signs means that central anticholinergic syndrome is a potential diagnosis in patients with just about any form of neurological abnormality, and that the incidence could be inversely proportional to the rigour with which other diagnoses are excluded. In some settings, rigorous exclusion of all other conditions may be simply impossible in the immediate post-operative period. The diagnosis, therefore, is heavily dependent on a response to physostigmine, whose central effects extend beyond the cholinergic system [7,8]. Perhaps central anticholinergic syndrome is a misnomer, and central physostigmine responsive syndrome is a more accurate description. This does not mean that post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome should be dismissed out of hand. The case report by Sun [9] cannot easily be explained by any other diagnosis. This is a report of three general anaesthetics in one patient, who took 14 and 10 h to regain full consciousness after repair of retinal detachment under general anaesthesia that included reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine and atropine. On the third occasion, an identical anaesthetic to the second was given but without reversal of neuromuscular blockade. This time the patient was fully conscious 10 min after the end of the anaesthesia. Physostigmine was not available in the hospital involved. Physostigmine shortens wakening times after general anaesthesia [10]. However, its duration of action is about 30–60 min after intravenous (i.v.) injection [11] and, in common with other 'antidotes' such as naloxone and flumazenil, there is a danger of later recurrence of symptoms. Reported side effects of physostigmine in this setting include nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps [10,12,13] and bradycardia and hypotension [13]. It would therefore seem appropriate to avoid treating one drug's side effects with another drug that exposes patients to other risks. We should accept that some patients recover from anaesthesia more slowly than others, and perhaps the safest course of action is to observe and support them during this time. Careful choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs tailored to individual circumstances should reduce the need for prolonged support. Until a more rigid definition is available, preferably supported by a controlled trial, differences in the reported incidence of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome seem likely to continue.

These include certain changes to perception, cognition, and affect,1 which we refer to here as the acute subjective effects of psychedelics. In recent years, psychedelics such as psilocybin have also shown considerable promise as therapeutic agents when combined with talk therapy, for example, in the treatment of major depression or substance use disorder.2 However, it is currently unclear whether the aforementioned acute subjective effects are necessary to bring about the observed therapeutic effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics. This uncertainty has sparked a lively-though still largely hypothetical-debate on whether psychedelics without subjective effects (\"nonsubjective psychedelics\" or \"non-hallucinogenic psychedelics\") could still have the same therapeutic impact, or whether the acute subjective effects are in fact necessary for this impact to be fully realized.3,4,5.",

Withdrawal dyskinesia appears under similar circumstances but disappears spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks. Cholinergic overactivity and changes in dopamine-acetylcholine balance in the basal ganglia may underlie these withdrawal syndromes. The principal value of the concept of covert dyskinesia is in the secondary and tertiary prevention of tardive dyskinesia through early discovery and treatment.",

Patient acceptance of the need for medication and even the colour and size of the tablets can obliterate the placebo effect or contribute to non-pharmacological adverse effects.

      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

      "abstract": "The relationship between alcoholism and depressive disorder is complex. Nevertheless it is necessary to analyse this relationship in order to take in charge properly the patients with such a comorbidity. Firstly, some alcoholic patients may develop a major depressive disorder in their life without any relationship with their alcoholism (accidental co-occurrence). Secondly, the vast majority of alcoholic patients have experienced depressive symptoms, specially during withdrawal. Finally, some alcoholics may present a severe depressive episode that require a specific treatment, the alcoholism being explained (secondary alcoholism) or not (primary alcoholism) by the depressive disorder. The alcoholism/depression comorbidity majors the consequences of alcoholism, increases the frequency of hospitalisation, and worsens the prognostic. It is thus important to detect such a comorbidity, although the evaluation of mood is complex in alcohol-dependent patients. The age at onset of each disorder, and the modification of one disorder during partial remission of the other, help to distinguish primary and secondary alcoholism. Antidepressive drugs are mainly limited to severe depression, primary depression, and depression with a high risk of suicide.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that crime is a social phenomenon, we consider necessary to analyze it as an individual action committed by a real person in an actual circumstance. We mention that crime is a human action, determined by certain psychological elements, necessities, reasons, purposes. In Romania, the evolution of the crime phenomenon is a consequence of the impact of severe socio-economic issues, characteristic of the transition period, as well as of the authority crisis transited by the competent state institutions. The defective legislation and the overburdening of the criminal justice system, associated with the lack of staff and logistics, have limited the effect of preventive and repressive measures. Therefore, people who consume substances submitted for national inspection are called drug addicts or drug abusers. According to the World Health Organization, narcomania is “the state of constant or chronic intoxication, harmful for the individual and for society, caused by the repeated consumption of a certain drug (natural or artificial) – &lt;em&gt;it is characterized by the following&lt;/em&gt; – an irresistible need to continue consuming it and acquiring it by all means, a tendency to increase its dosage and a psychical, sometimes physical addiction for the effects of the drug”. Drugs of all types have been considered “magic” pills the molecular structure of which is well known by chemists, physicians and pharmacists. In literature they are also called “millenary fragile molecules”, which from ancient times were “glorified”, but in fact they do not have supernatural powers, but deceive people, being in fact a “two-faced coin”. The first face is the one which creates appeal and the second is the one which creates addiction, making us change our behavior and avoid our family and lose our friends. Thus we can state that one of the highest challenges of humanity is represented by drug consumption. The multiple environmental changes and the set of social, economic, and psychological changes are aspects which negatively influence people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/strong&gt;As a general conclusion, we can state that presently, illicit drug trafficking and consumption is the most successful business. The illicit drug market is considered the most “dynamic” crime market. Regarding the facts previously mentioned, we want to show that the citizens of the European Union spend over 24 billion lei a year on drugs.",

Statements provided by these authors seem to confirm this: \"The patient, and not the drug product, is the major focus of the pharmacists' decision and actions\" and \"Too little (suboptimal) drug may be classified as a DRP when the desired outcome for a patient is not being realized.\" Other DRP definitions include a \"circumstance of drug therapy that may interfere with a desired therapeutic objective\"2 and an \"undesirable sign or symptom actually or potentially experienced by patients that is related to drug therapy.\"3 Given these definitions, are DRPs considered circumstances that can interfere with therapeutic objectives?

All countries strive to fight it by any means necessary. The World Health Organization defines addiction as the compulsive desire to continue using or obtaining a substance by any means, with a tendency to increase the dose taken. This addiction causes psychological and physical dependence and a detrimental effect on both individuals and society. This complicates the treatment project process, especially if the patient/addict suffers from psychological and/or mental disorders associated with addiction. In particular, personality disorders have a direct impact on the behaviors, performance, functions and thinking patterns of the sufferer. As the latter adopts an unhealthy and rigid pattern that causes them and those around them to suffer several psychological, health, social, professional and relational problems... Relatedly, we decided to present a clinical case with a dual diagnosis, as this patient has been suffering from the consequences of addiction for many years accompanied by a personality disorder. As for the clinical symptoms that top the clinical board of the case, we find a complete aversion to his body as he has not looked in the mirror for nearly 30 years. The patient has lost the symbolic representation of his body as a physical reality through which it is located internally, externally and cognitively. This comes in addition to severe clinical suffering at the level of familial, social and professional relationships, which made him live in a state of permanent social isolation. In our therapeutic approach to the condition, we use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common type of psychotherapy in a regular manner, through a limited number of therapeutic sessions. The therapeutic intervention was carried out at the level of perception of incorrect or negative thinking, which enabled difficult situations to be presented more clearly and responded to in a more effective manner.

Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Acute alcohol ingestion can lead to psychiatric emergencies. The main syndromes observed are states of agitation, acute anxiety episodes and suicide or attempted suicide. States of agitation are mainly due to simple or pathological inebriety. Any case of acute alcoholic intoxication requires a full clinical examination and a simple laboratory work-up. Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states. States of anxiety generally regress with non-neuroleptic tranquilizers, and attempted suicide mainly requires close surveillance or intensive care.",

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale is a sensitive and specific tool for generalised anxiety which can also help in identifying accompanying depression. The differentiating feature is that patients may deny any severe anxiety, although sometimes anxiety is part of the drug effect. A single drug alone is an unusual cause unless higher doses are being used, or the patient is very young or elderly. The risk is much greater when two or more at-risk drugs are used together and this risk can be reduced by avoiding combinations of drugs with this effect.

      "title": "Trihexyphenidyl Use Disorder and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug commonly used in treating movement disorders.[1] The widespread use of trihexyphenidyl has led to the exploration of its abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, euphoriant, hallucinogenic, and sexual stimulant effects.[2] It is a popular drug of abuse among the thrill-seeking adolescent male population, used either orally or smoked in a powdered form mixed with tobacco.[3] The prevalence of trihexyphenidyl abuse has been reported to vary from 6.5% to 34% among schizophrenia patients, with doses of trihexyphenidyl abuse varying from 28 mg/day to as high as 200 mg/day.[4] The risk factors for trihexyphenidyl abuse are male gender, unemployment, concomitant use of other illicit substances, family history of substance dependence, long-term use of trihexyphenidyl, and severe mental disorders.[4] The most common aim of abuse is anxiolysis, sedation, or a mood-enhancing euphoric effect to alleviate depressive and negative symptoms.[4] Even though trihexyphenidyl dependence has been previously described, the literature is scanty as it may mimic a primary psychiatric illness leading to misdiagnosis further compounded by a lack of awareness about the drug's abuse potential. We describe a case where prescribed trihexyphenidyl use gradually progressed to a use disorder, leading to social, financial, occupational, and biological dysfunctions. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old male with a history of possible dissociative episodes of unresponsiveness associated with anxiety, currently in remission and off all medications, presented to the psychiatry outpatient department with the inability to stop consuming trihexyphenidyl tablets. For the past 4 years, the patient has had bilateral fine hand tremors, for which tablet trihexyphenidyl was initiated for possible essential tremors, titrated to 4–5 mg per day. After 2 years of regular use, he noticed that his tremor completely resolved after the trihexyphenidyl dose and would aggravate after 4–5 h of the last dose of trihexyphenidyl, along with slurring of speech. Over the next year, the use frequency increased to more than 6–8 mg per day as the duration of relief from tremors decreased with each dose. He started experiencing other difficulties whenever the effect of trihexyphenidyl wore out, such as a generalized feeling of the slowness of movements, stiffness in body parts, difficulty walking, and difficulty in writing. Patient's writing samples, with and without consumption of trihexyphenidyl are attached in Figure 1. Simultaneously, he also noticed that trihexyphenidyl ingestion made him feel energetic, increased his self-confidence, and made him happier. He would get a high with its consumption and described it as if \"everything was possible\" for him. He took trihexyphenidyl first thing in the morning to get out of bed and start his day. He would also spend more money under the effect of trihexyphenidyl than his usual self, would at times be involved in activities that caused him financial harm, such as lending money to people recklessly and also experienced substantially increased libido. Over the next few months, he noticed that after the effects of THP waned off, he would start to experience low mood, reduced interest in carrying out activities, would feel that life is vain, had to struggle with all the movements and started to have suicidal ideations. Later, he started using trihexyphenidyl without prescription at about 10–12 mg per day in divided doses, sourcing it from his workplace pharmacy. He experienced side effects of the medication, like dry mouth, but chose to ignore it to alleviate the depressive symptoms. A representation of illness graph of the patient is given in Figure 2.Figure 1: Handwriting samples of the patient before and after taking a dose of trihexyphenidyl. The image is not reused from any source or copyrightFigure 2: Illness graph of the patient. THP: Trihexyphenidyl, TDS: thrice dailyOn examination, he had fine bilateral hand tremors, the speech was slurred, facial expressions were reduced, gait with a forward stooped posture and bradykinesia. On mental status examination, depressed affect and decreased self-esteem were present. He had taken trihexyphenidyl 4 h before this examination. Various differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out systematically. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was ruled out due to nonspecific motor symptoms and symptom onset only after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal. Drug-induced Parkinson's was ruled out as the current symptoms from the past 4 years have been without the use of any neuroleptics. Vascular Parkinsonism was ruled out due to prominent upper limb involvement and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Wilson's disease evaluation was negative. With a provisional diagnosis of trihexyphenidyl use disorder based on tolerance, craving, and use despite harm and withdrawals, he was started on tablet escitalopram 5 mg and up-titrated to 10 mg to counter the depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal; tablet propranolol 20 mg was started to manage the tremors, and trihexyphenidyl tapered slowly over 6 months. At the follow-up, he had decreased trihexyphenidyl dose gradually to 2 mg per day without any withdrawal. He maintained well without any tremors. Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication as a case report. DISCUSSION DSM 5 recognizes the antiparkinsonian drugs (including trihexyphenidyl) abuse under the \"other (or unknown) substance use disorder\" category. ICD 10 did not clarify any such category, and ICD 11 describes \"disorder due to use of other specified psychoactive substances including medications.\" However, it does not describe the classes of medications. Hence, whether nonprescription misuse of trihexyphenidyl should be regarded as psychoactive substance use is still questionable. The euphorigenic effects of trihexyphenidyl can be explained by the inhibition of dopamine reuptake and storage consequent to the strong muscarinic receptor blockade[4] as well as its increased affinity for dopamine receptors in the limbic area at higher dosages. Thus, it stimulates the central nervous reward system leading to a \"high.\"[5] Similar stimulant effects have been described with other anticholinergics, such as biperiden and procyclidine.[6] However, tolerance to these effects also develops fast, compelling the patient to increase the doses, which may lead to exaggerating its adverse effects and psychosis-like behavior alterations.[4] This anticholinergic abuse has also been associated with withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs in Parkinson's disease often markedly exacerbates Parkinsonian symptoms, movement disorders,[7] depressive or dysphoric mood symptoms, and even results in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[8] This could be due to acetylcholine receptor hypersensitivity in response to long-term anticholinergic use. The sudden anticholinergic withdrawal might worsen the severity of the symptoms than the initial presentation.[9] A similar phenomenon was observed in our patient, who developed motor symptoms following the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl. Ruberg et al.[10] in 1982 reported increased acetylcholine receptor densities in the frontal lobes of patients on anticholinergics; similar changes are expected to be seen in nigrostriatal cholinergic receptors.[9] The hypersensitive cholinergic receptor state is similar to the cholinergic excess stage in Parkinsonism, leading to various movement dysfunctions. However, it is essential to mention that going by this mechanism of action, all anticholinergics would have an abuse potential, which is not evident. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elicited. An image representing possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal is given in Figure 3.Figure 3: Possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal effects. Ach: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, \"rec\": ReceptorsIn this case, evidence suggesting trihexyphenidyl withdrawal-induced movement and mood disorders is the presence of a temporal relationship between trihexyphenidyl dosing and symptom onset which appears to be very similar to the \"on-off\" phenomenon seen with levodopa use in patients of Parkinson's disease. Among various management options, one study suggests tapering 1 mg of trihexyphenidyl every 2 weeks. Another deprescribing guideline by the University of Sydney and Macquarie University recommends a relatively slow tapering, reducing 25% of the daily dose in 1–4 weeks, depending on the nature and severity of withdrawal symptoms, and ending the treatment 2 weeks after giving the lowest dose. Nonpharmacological support such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, exercise, and social support should be given. If tapering is ineffective, consider switching to another anticholinergic agent, with minimal side effects. Tapering off trihexyphenidyl within 3 months of starting has been recommended.[5] Therefore, in light of such reported cases, it is essential to realize that easy affordability, availability, and prolonged prescription would lead to easy escalation of trihexyphenidyl doses leading to potential misuse among patients and this needs to be dealt with caution.

      "abstract": "Patients with the combination of cannabis abuse and psychosis are difficult to treat. The intoxicated state has many similarities to schizophrenia. Like other drugs with abuse potential cannabis affects the brain's reward system. It has not been possible to show major structural changes in the cerebrum, but by electron microscopy structural changes can be shown in animals especially in the hippocampus. The drug is taken in order to escape reality, and a vicious circle tending to maintain the person's abuse pattern which includes reduced energy, judgment and memory may be established. Cannabis may cause toxic psychosis, with a tendency to recurrent psychoses with continued abuse. There is no convincing support for the assumption that cannabis can cause chronic functional psychosis following cessation of abuse. Schizophrenic patients who use cannabis are often trying to reduce the discomfort caused by symptoms in the prodromal phase. By continued abuse positive psychotic symptoms are worsened. Antidepressant drugs may diminish the depressive elements of the disease. Some cannabis users are especially sensitive and develop toxic psychosis. Patients with repeated toxic psychosis may erroneously be diagnosed as schizophrenics. It is therefore important to be aware that a psychotic state may be caused by abuse of cannabis, and adjust treatment to this fact.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Symptoms associated with use are often indistinguishable from those encountered with a primary mental illness and also include aggression, confusion, and anxiety. For these patients, clinicians rely on physical presentation, symptom(s) onset, and episode duration when evaluating patients.An adult man was involuntarily admitted to inpatient status secondary to reports of bizarre behaviors that included paranoia and psychomotor agitation. Because of the severity of the symptoms, he was unable to participate in the admission assessment. On day 2, he reported having smoked a substance provided by a friend. In addition, he admitted to previous SC use on 3 occasions, with each occasion resulting in an involuntary admission to inpatient status. The course of this admission was unremarkable.A brief overview of psychiatric signs and symptoms of SC use and information to help clinicians are included. The presentation of psychotic symptoms secondary to SC may be consistent with those of psychosis or other substances of abuse.

Again, aging is highly associated with physical impairment such as mobility issues, ADL/IADL status, and use of supportive devices. Still, there is no such extensive research about the link between depression and chronic health diseases or conditions. So, in this paper, we find the relationship between depression and physical impairments such as mobility problems, ADL/IADL status, and the use of any assist or supporting device(s) as well as to understand the effect of some psychosocial factors on the development of late-life depression.",

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

      "abstract": "Medication adherence is increasingly being recognized as a significant issue in treating geriatric patients. A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy. Health literacy has emerged as an important factor that affects older persons' capacity, for example, to make health care choices.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic factors pertinent to medication adherence include whether patients have insurance or other financial resources to pay for the medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients' relationship with their physician as well as the physician's communication style can affect adherence.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older adult with memory problems, we have found that whether patients depend on themselves or a caregiver can have a significant impact on adherence.6 Not all caregivers take responsibility for a patient's medication, and family members' beliefs about a medication can also affect the patient's adherence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation of elders' medication adherence as a factor in treatment success or failure is thus potentially complex, difficult, and time consuming.",

      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

An acute withdrawal of drugs with addiction potential is associated with a sympathetic overactivity leading to marked psychomimetic disturbances. Acute intoxication or withdrawal of such drugs is often associated with life-threatening complications which require ICU admission and necessitate prolonged sedative analgesic medications, weaning from which is often complicated by withdrawal and other psychomimetic symptoms. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 (α(2)) agonist, has been used successfully to facilitate withdrawal and detoxification of various drugs and also to control delirium in ICU patients. Herein, we report a case of a chronic opioid abuse (heroin) patient admitted with acute overdose complications leading to a prolonged ICU course requiring sedative-analgesic medication; the drug withdrawal-related symptoms further complicated the weaning process. Dexmedetomidine infusion was successfully used as a sedative-analgesic to control the withdrawal-related psychomimetic symptoms and to facilitate smooth detoxification and weaning from opioid and other sedatives.",

      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

It may result in an impairment of the function and quality of life of these patients. Chronic pain is a syndrome, which influences and is influenced by many potential factors (physiological psychological and social), all of which require treatment to achieve an optimal clinical outcome. Effective management of chronic pain in this population is attainable, if properly recognized and treated. Reasons for inadequate pain control by clinicians include lack of training, inadequate pain assessment and reluctance to prescribe opiates. The approach to pain assessment and management is often different and more complex for older patients than for younger ones. In older people, a host of factors can impede assessment and drug management, including multiple medical problems and many potential sources of pain, sensory impairment, depression, disability and impaired cognitive function. In addition, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics unique to the geriatric population make this group vulnerable to adverse medication effects. By using appropriate pharmacological combined with non-pharmacological treatment, it is often possible to improve function ability to a greater extent than the severity of pain reduced.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

While initially these pharmacons were used in the treatment of psychotic states (including psychotic mania) in the last approximately 10-15 years new indications - such as treatment of depressive, manic and mixed states and also mood-stabilization in bipolar disorder and also the treatment of major depressive disorder - for several second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) agents have been introduced. Taking this fact into consideration it is not surprising that the market of SGAs has been broadened in several countries. At the same time, safety issues have been raised related to some SGAs, mainly because of their adverse cardiometabolic effects (e.g. weight gain; dyslipidemia; disturbances of glucose metabolism). Related to this, it is worthy of note that the lifespan of patients with serious mental illness (SMIs, such as schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; major depression) is shorter than their healthy counterparts and that somatic comorbidities (mainly cardiovascular disorders) of these patients are primarily responsible for this fact. In this paper, firstly we briefly discuss the history and features of APs then we present data on the shorter than expected lifespan of patients with SMIs and also the possible background mechanisms of it (including the supposed role of AP treatment). Then we provide a short discussion on endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), their role in cardiovascular system and related clinical relevance. Eventually, we also discuss our pilot study with the aim to reveal whether there is any effect of AP therapy on the number of CD34/KDR double-positive EPCs.",

      "abstract": "The limited psychiatric bedspace due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of access to an up-to-date medication regimen delayed the recognition of the diagnosis and treatment for a 40-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, who traveled from his home city and abruptly discontinued his prescription of clozapine. He developed a cholinergic rebound syndrome including delirium and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). The delay included time spent in two different medical hospitals: one awaiting psychiatric bedspace, and secondly, when the patient's cholinergic rebound syndrome was misdiagnosed as acute alcohol withdrawal. Once the etiology was recognized, he was promptly treated with anticholinergic medication (benztropine) and retitrated to his outpatient dose of clozapine leading to the resolution of symptoms including delirium and EPS. This case will discuss the challenges of continuity of care in delirious, psychotic, or otherwise confused patients, including contributions from the COVID-19 pandemic. A medication card or other improvements in medication databases that may reduce delays in treatment are discussed.",

An individual may suffer an accident such as a car crash or near-drowning while under the influence (consequences related to use in dangerous situations). An individual may acknowledge the need for treatment after losing his/her job, home, car, friends, and family (job and personal role and social consequences). Alternatively, an individual may merely feel socially isolated, alienated, and fraught with physical reactions (e.g., shakes) that are unpleasant.

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

Since the core symptoms of the dependence syndrome have been defined as comprising a dimension of disability distinct from social, health and other consequences of substance abuse, we examined the relationships of dependence syndrome symptoms and related problems for drugs. We included cannabis, stimulants, barbiturates, tranquilizers, cocaine, opiates and hallucinogens in our analyses. Results showed high clustering of dependence symptoms with each other and with health, social and emotional problems attributed to drug use. This supports the syndrome concept for the core dependence symptoms, but not the concept that the symptoms form distinct dimensions from associated problems.",

This disorder has been formally recognized as a distinct anxiety disorder since DSM-III was published in 1980. In Japan, a number of psychopathological and psychotherapeutic studies have been performed since the 1930s on a pathological condition similar to SAD, known as Taijin-kyofu (TK). TK, especially the convinced subtype of TK (c-TK; also known as the offensive subtype of TK), is described as a culture-bound syndrome similar to SAD. In proposed DSM-5 draft, it is suggested to add \"offending others\" to fear of being humiliating or embarrassing which were indicated in DSM-IV. It is interesting that fearing of making another person uncomfortable or \"offending others\" is consistent with symptom which has been investigated through c-TK in particular. The relation between SAD and TK will become clear in examination by new diagnostic criteria (DSM-5) more in future.",

      "abstract": "A broader palette of safe and better-tolerated agents is available for treating people suffering from chronic schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders. However, current medical treatments are still only partially effective, and highly-prevalent psychiatric disorders continue to represent a huge personal and socio-economic burden. Most pharmacological agents sometimes induce a variety of severe movement disorders, including dystonia or dyskinesia, with an acute, subacute or more chronic time course. More extensive cerebral condition, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome or the serotonin syndrome may be induced by antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Medications commonly involve dopamine receptor blockers, antidepressants and anti-epileptics, among many others. Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia [1]. The traditional and atypical neuroleptics sometimes induce dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, tremor, hyperkinesia and movement disorders [1]. A better understanding of the impact of these drug-induced adverse effects may provide new strategies to develop novel neuroleptics with less adverse metabolic effects and to develop complementary medical therapies to patients treated with antipsychotic medication [2]. The lack of success in discovering more effective pharmacotherapy has contributed, together with many other factors, to a relative few useful findings on new drug targets for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Depression has surpassed HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war as the leading cause of disability and economic burden worldwide. It is the most common psychiatric disorder in developed countries. Another major public health issue is chronic pain. In Europe, pain is the most common cause for people to use healthcare resources. Nevertheless, there are no universally accepted treatment guidelines for treating chronic pain. The well-known anaesthetic agent ketamine appears as an interesting and promising management drug for both conditions. A single dose of ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms within minutes in patients who have failed to respond to two or more conventional antidepressants and these effects are sustained for one week to months. Ketamine is also effective for bipolar depression, it decreases suicidal ideation and has shown positive results in the treatment of other mental conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Furthermore, ketamine has shown antidepressant effects in patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy. Therefore, the off-label use of ketamine (i.e. using it for different purposes than anaesthesia) is increasingly common in the medical setting. In order to treat patients who are refractory to depression and chronic pain treatments, healthcare professionals are claiming compassionate reasons to obtain the authorisation to use ketamine as an antidepressant and/or analgesic. However, ketamine is a mood enhancer and its hedonistic use is widespread. Under medical surveillance and based in growing scientific evidence, the current psychedelic renaissance is bringing a new paradigm in the treatment of different types of disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medical treatment of the addictions remains controversial, with addiction itself viewed as a lifestyle problem, a hijacking of brain systems by drugs, or as a medical illness. Many of these controversies may be avoided by taking a goal-oriented approach to treatment, in which clinical objectives are defined, and both medications and psychological interventions are used to facilitate progress towards these. The effectiveness of medications is maximized when they are used as one component of a comprehensive treatment plan. There are no ‘magic bullets’ in addiction treatment—the same pharmacological principles apply to these drug treatments as to any other. Drugs need to be given in effective doses, at appropriate intervals, allowed time to reach steady state, and also to dissipate when terminated on the basis of their half-life. Some drugs also have an abuse potential of their own (e.g. opiates, sedative-hypnotics) especially those with a rapid onset of action, and such drugs need to be particularly closely monitored and controlled, to minimize their diversion and misuse.",

Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas.

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

Despite the introduction of many antidepressants over the following years, a large proportion of depressed patients fail to respond to available treatments, and this constitutes a continuing therapeutic challenge.",

A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

Hence, intravenous administration of the antagonist flumazenil is indicated in patients with suspected acute opiate intoxication resistant to naloxone. Cocaine abuse is not frequent in this country but is usually very severe and clinically heterogeneous. The clinical pattern of cocaine intoxication is initially due to excitatory and later to depressant effects on central nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems.

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is a unique drug, sharing properties of hallucinogens and stimulants. The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pica is a behavioral disturbance characterized by persistent consumption of non‐nutritive, nonfood substances. According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices. This review article is a good educational material for medical and psychological practitioners whose goal is to improve knowledge and diagnostic processes of psychosis and its related disorders.",

      "abstract": "Depression is recognised as the most common mental health disorder in the elderly. It does not only increase the morbidity, but it increases the mortality as well. Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

Consumption seems to be driven and maintained for desired effects on cognitive or emotional states. ‘Drug use’ in some situations is seen as socially acceptable such as getting a caffeine ‘hit’ from a morning cup of coffee to ‘get going’ or drinking alcohol as part of a social occasion. However, for some individuals and for some substances, drug use risks adverse consequences for brain function and possible enduring harm. This chapter will focus on how brain function may be altered as a consequence of drug use and describe the current understanding of the neurobiology of drugs of abuse and how this may be related to neuropsychiatric consequences. Drugs can produce neuropsychiatric effects acutely during intoxication or withdrawal, and also after chronic exposure, with effects which may or may not be enduring with abstinence.",

      "abstract": "espanolDesafortunadamente, los trastornos de personalidad han sido excluidos habitualmente de los ensayos farmacologicos por problemas conceptuales o de medida. Esta falta de estudios, mas que la existencia de evidencia negativa, ha llevado a que tradicionalmente se haya considerado que los sujetos con un trastorno de personalidad no se pudieran beneficiar de un adecuado tratamiento farmacologico. Los pacientes que sufren trastorno de personalidad (TP) muestran un funcionamiento social e interpersonal significativamente peor, consumiendo recursos socio-sanitarios con unos pobres resultados. En los TP, la farmacoterapia se utiliza para tratar aspectos especificos, como son los sintomas cognitivos perceptuales, afectivos o los derivados de la impulsividad. Debido a que es un fenomeno polimorfico, se utilizan diferentes tipos de psicofarmacos, como por ejemplo, antipsicoticos, antidepresivos o estabilizadores del animo. Ha habido pocos intentos sistematicos de validar los actuales algoritmos de tratamiento de los trastornos de personalidad severos. Esto ha hace que en el momento actual no haya guias en la literatura para el uso de farmacoterapia en el manejo de los TP. El objetivo de este trabajo es llevar a cabo una revision de los estudios sobre eficacia y tolerabilidad de los psicofarmacos en los TP. EnglishUnfortunately, personality disorders have been usually excluded from pharmacological trials due to conceptualization and measures problems. This lack of studies rather than negative evidence, has made that traditionally subjects suffering a personality disorder couldn't benefit from adequate drug treatment. Patients with personality disorder (PD) show significant impairment in the domain of interpersonal and social functioning and may use the resources of health and social services extensively, with little beneficial outcome. In PD, pharmacotherapy is used for the treatment of specific PD pathology facets, such as cognitive-perceptual, affective, or impulsivity symptoms. Due to the polymorphic phenomenology of the disorder, different classes of drugs are used, e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, or mood stabilizers. There has been little systematic attempt to validate current pharmacologic treatment algorithms for severe personality disorder. At present there are no clear guidelines in literature for the use of pharmacotherapy in the management of PD. The aim of this work is to perform a review of studies focusing on the efficacy and tolerability of psychopharmacology in the PD.",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the differentiation of schizophrenia in the setting of adult psychiatry from neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD's) and psychosis due to other medical conditions (PDMC). Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

Reactive depressive syndromes can be associated with the restriction of social competence due to increasing multi-morbidity, loneliness, social isolation, the consequences of retirement, interpersonal conflicts, and the loss of partners or close relatives. Endogenous depressive syndromes in the elderly are frequently combined with diffuse and changing somatic complaints, psychomotor restlessness and agitation. Furthermore, depressive syndromes can be caused by somatic illness, degenerative disorders, other organic diseases or certain drugs. The presence of simultaneously occurring somatic illness, positive family history, certain personality traits, and severity of disease could exert an adverse influence on clinical outcome.

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

      "abstract": "Relapse can be defined as \"the return of a disease after partial recovery\". This definition is directly applicable to schizophrenic disorder. Relapse in this condition can be evaluated at the symptomatic, phenomenological and behavioural levels. Relapse impinges on inter-personal, social and occupational spheres of the patient's activity. In turn, relapse has wider implications for the family in general, for the provision of medical and social facilities and for health economics. There are no generally accepted criteria for relapse but outcomes such as violence or suicide, extreme psychotic behaviour and rehospitalization have been used. Less obvious criteria include major and minor symptom worsening and prodromata. Relapse is a relative term and must take into account the following factors: the patient's condition before the original onset of illness; his level of functioning before the present episode; the severity of the relapse in terms of symptom severity, duration and interference with personal functioning; the appearance of any new symptoms or behaviour patterns; the type of treatment given prior to relapse, and hence relatively ineffective; the type of treatment given during relapse, and its efficacy. Relapses often follow a pattern which may be fairly specific to each individual patient. Social factors may have predictive power but these need validation in different samples.",

Evidentemente en la practica clinica es deseable modificar un estado de animo con el proposito de aliviar la ansiedad generalizada, la depresion o un trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, por citar solo algunos ejemplos. Uno de los grandes logros de la medicina moderna es haber desarrollado farmacos eficaces para el tratamiento de diversos trastornos de animo con lo cual la calidad de vida de un gran numero de personas se ha incrementado notablemente. Gracias a este avance trastornos que en el pasado eran incapacitantes y requerian hospitalizacion pueden ser tratados en consulta externa con muy buenos resultados. Esto ha sido posible por la investigacion clinica y cientifica que ha llevado al desarrollo de nuevas moleculas, de diversas formas farmaceuticas y de regimenes de dosificacion apropiados para el tratamiento de distintos trastornos. Dentro de las sustancias psicoactivas no solo se encuentran las medicinas que controlan los trastornos del estado de animo, del sueno o de la ansiedad, sino las drogas de abuso, llamadas asi por su alta capacidad para producir adiccion. La experiencia indica que hay que ser cauteloso con los compuestos que conforman esta categoria ya que su consumo conlleva el riesgo de perder el control sobre la cantidad ingerida, con las consecuencias negativas asociadas para el sujeto y la sociedad. ?En que consisten las diferencias entre las medicinas psicoactivas y las drogas de abuso? La respuesta a esta pregunta es compleja y requiere tener en cuenta que los efectos de los farmacos dependen no solo de sus mecanismos particulares de accion sino de las condiciones de las personas que los consumen, del regimen de dosificacion (cuanto y cuando se toma), de la forma farmaceutica (pastilla, tableta dispersable, jarabe, ampolleta para inyeccion, parche de liberacion prolongada, etc.) y de la via de administracion.

      "title": "The “new syndrome excuse syndrome”",
      "abstract": "I Introduction Behavioral science is on the march. Psychiatrists and psychologists are identifying an ever-proliferating and often bewildering array of new syndromes or disorders. Some have received the clinical and scientific imprimatur of actual inclusion the American Psychiatric Association's official diagnostic manual, referred to as DSM-IV.(2) Examples of the diagnostically respectable disorders include: Antisocial Personality Disorder,(3) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,(4) Intermittent Explosive Disorder,(5) Kleptomania, and Pathological Gambling.(6) DSM-IV characterizes other categories as in need of further study because their existence as discrete psychopathological entities is not yet sufficiently validated to warrant inclusion the manual.(7) Examples Postconcussional Disorder,(8) Caffeine Withdrawal,(9) and Dysphoric Disorder(10) (which was formerly termed Premenstrual Syndrome or PMS and, later, Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder). Finally, and least respectably, some alleged syndromes have not received general provisional recognition as valid, but are advocated with varying degrees of success by clinicians and researchers who have supposedly identified them. Examples from the last group, which have been chosen from the mental health and legal literatures and from legal cases, where they often arise, include, Battered Woman Syndrome,(11) Vietnam Syndrome,(12) Sexual Abuse Syndrome,(13) Holocaust Survivor Syndrome,(14) Urban Survival Syndrome,(15) Rotten Social Background,(16) and Adopted Child Syndrome.(17) Diagnostic identification, research, and advocacy are unproblematic if they are confined within the mental health professionals' domain. Although the concepts of mental and behavioral abnormality are hotly contested, human suffering is potentially involved, and we will all probably benefit from activities aimed at acquiring valid knowledge of how our mental and behavioral nature is carved at the joints. But swept away by the torrent of science and, alas, pseudo-science concerning alleged new syndromes, many people now suffer from yet another new that I have identified, or at least given a name: the Syndrome Excuse Syndrome. The primary diagnostic criterion for this is an almost irresistible impulse to use the alleged discovery of syndromes of mental abnormality as good reason to alter the criminal law. Those suffering from the new include many members of the criminal defense bar, properly seeking any possible purchase to exonerate defendants, legal commentators, some mental health professionals, and some judges and legislatures. Courts and, less often, legislatures are increasingly inundated with claims that syndromes old and new, validated and unvalidated, should be the basis for two types of legal change. The first is the creation of new affirmative defenses. Examples are claims for the creation of a discrete battered victim or urban survivor syndrome defense. The second change proposal is the expansion of old defenses: for example, loosening objective standards for justifications such as self-defense. All too often, I fear, the new syndromes are not sufficiently validated and are the product of unacceptably soft science or clinical crockery. Nevertheless, this paper will not discuss the pseudo-science problem. Instead, it will accept the validity of some of the new syndromes or some yet to be discovered syndromes because the legal issues are theoretically and practically important only if claimed new syndromes do have reasonable validity. Consequently, this article win assume away the scientific and clinical problems and will focus on the conceptual difficulties and policy dilemmas the New Syndrome Excuse Syndrome presents. This article attempts to clear the theoretical terrain to determine how the criminal law should understand and respond to claims that new evidence warrants the expansion of existing defenses or the creation of new ones. …",

While physical dependence is linked to withdrawal syndrome, psychic dependence, on the Author's opinion, is related to a long-standing previous state of true or masked endogenous depression (in this case it would be well termed as \"neuropsychological dependence\"), and the drug taking is only a maladaptive self-medication. This thesis is substantiated by the literature, reporting, in chronic drug addicts the use of the whole series of antidepressants (i.e. tricyclics, doxepine, lithium, etc.), with noticeable therapeutical success. According with other reports and with personal experience, the Authors maintain a great importance to drugs acting, directly or not, on GABA, i.e. l-glutamine, piracetam, and, particularly, N-dipropilacetic acid.",

      "title": "Biological basis of addiction and alcohol use disorder",
      "abstract": "ADDICTION Addiction is a health condition characterized by extreme difficulty to stop or decrease the use of a drug despite known negative consequences to a person's health and livelihood.1 A drug of addiction is a substance that has the potential to produce addiction in a minority of vulnerable individuals who use that drug. These drugs include, but are not limited to, alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines, sedatives like benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and opioids like heroin and fentanyl. Furthermore, the route of administration plays an important role in the degree to which a drug can be considered addictive. In general, when drug use is temporally coupled to its rewarding or interoceptive effects, that type of use is more addictive than when the drug's subjective effects are temporally decoupled from drug administration. This phenomenon is best exemplified by the difference in addiction liability between oral and i.v. administration of methylphenidate.2 The biological basis of addiction has been well-studied in humans and animal models, which has resulted in a conceptual framework for which to understand the addiction process. This framework includes 3 stages that are cyclical in nature: binge/intoxication, negative affect/withdrawal, and anticipation/preoccupation. Each stage is associated with underlying brain regions and neural circuitry that contribute to the behaviors and mental phenomena characteristic of that stage.1 A person can enter the addiction cycle at any stage, not just the binge/intoxication stage. For example, a person with chronic pain may enter the addiction cycle through the negative affect stage and then transition to binge/intoxication. Others may enter the binge/intoxication stage to self-medicate symptoms associated with psychiatric comorbidities.1 It is a cruel fact that drug use to alleviate these symptoms often exacerbates these symptoms long-term, entrapping a person in the addiction cycle. Therefore, addiction must be treated as a chronic medical disease (eg, diabetes and hypertension) for which long-term treatment is needed for some individuals. While this review will focus on the biological aspects, addiction is biopsychosocial in nature, and the effects of a person's environment and experiences are extremely important and cannot be decoupled from biology. Finally, addiction is extremely heterogeneous, and individual differences play a key role in addiction research and clinical practice. While this review focuses on alcohol, at least some of the concepts that characterize addiction to 1 substance generalize to other substances of addiction. Current alcohol use disorder (AUD) is diagnosed using the DSM-5, at least in the United States (see ICD-11 for international diagnostic criteria and definition), upon meeting at least 2 out of 11 criteria regarding one's symptoms and behaviors related to alcohol use in the past 12-month period. Symptom counts are used to classify mild (2–3), moderate (4–5), and severe (6+) AUD, and alcohol addiction is most associated with moderate to severe AUD. This highlights the important concept of AUD as a spectrum rather than categorical in nature. The neurobiology of addiction is highly distributed and complex, much of which could not be discussed here. For more comprehensive reviews, see.1,3–5 STAGES OF ADDICTION: FOCUS ON NEUROBIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL AND AUD Binge/Intoxication To become addicted, a person usually must use that drug frequently and over a relatively long period of time. Use that transitions to addiction is often binge use, which is heavy intake over a short period of time. For alcohol, binge drinking is defined by the NIAAA as 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men in a 2 h period.6 Binge drinking is linked to considerable health risks even for those people who do not transition into addiction.7 All drugs of addiction produce acute interoceptive (subjective) effects, which are usually net rewarding, within the organism.8 For alcohol, these subjective effects are stimulatory during the ascending limb of the blood alcohol concentration curve and sedative during the descending blood alcohol concentration curve. In general, people with greater sensitivity to the stimulatory effects and attenuated sensitivity to the sedative effects of alcohol are more likely to drink more and develop an AUD.9 The stimulatory effects of alcohol are mediated in part by the activation of dopamine and glutamate neurons that project from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (Acb), which is involved in the rewarding effects of nearly all drugs of addiction.1 This occurs in part from alcohol's positive allosteric effects on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptor (and increased presynaptic GABA release), resulting in disinhibition of these ventral tegmental area→nucleus accumbens glutamate and dopamine neurons.1 The sedative effects of alcohol are produced in part by alcohol's ability to decrease N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. Alcohol results in decreased NMDA receptors in the synaptic membrane, resulting in attenuated excitability of the neuron.10 These effects by alcohol on the GABA-A and NMDA receptors (among many other neurotransmitter systems) produce distributed effects on synaptic plasticity throughout the brain that underlie many of alcohol's subjective effects and intoxication. The tight association between drug use and the rewarding subjective effects produces a type of learning or conditioning that over time results in greater salience attribution to drug use and its associated cues (termed incentive sensitization). Again, this phenomenon is associated with the activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system coupled temporally to drug use and cues, among other distributed processes.1 Negative affect/withdrawal Following binge intake of an addictive drug, people often experience withdrawal and negative affect to some degree, which increases in severity over the course of drug binge use and subsequent periods of nonuse.1 This is a negative emotional state characterized by sadness, anxiety, irritability, malaise, dysphoria, stress, and loss of motivation for natural rewards. The repeated neurochemical effects of alcohol produce adaptations to the nervous system that result in withdrawal during periods of nonuse. These adaptations are homeostatic in nature and reflect the nervous system's \"attempt\" to correct the supra-physiological state that alcohol induces in the nervous system, a phenomenon termed \"opponent process\" in biological systems.1 The acute effects of alcohol produce a net effect of inhibition (diminished excitability through GABA-A and NMDA receptor modifications) of the nervous system that, in an attempt to return to homeostasis, rebounds to a state of elevated excitability of the nervous system. This is the biological basis for why at least some people with AUD experience alcohol withdrawal after abrupt cessation or significant reduction; of note, alcohol withdrawal may significantly vary across people, with some patients presenting with mild symptoms (eg, anxiety and irritability) while others developing severe withdrawal complicated by seizures or delirium tremens. Neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing factor, dynorphin, neuropeptide Y, oxytocin, and neurotensin are all involved in this stage, as well as stress response and negative emotionality in general. GABAergic, glutamatergic, and neuropeptide adaptations in the extended amygdala are most linked to this negative affect stage. Other brain regions like the habenula and hypothalamus are involved.1 Preoccupation/Anticipation The long-term use of alcohol diminishes cortical control over other parts of the brain, diminishing behavioral flexibility and the ability to choose to use or not to use a drug of addiction, especially under the backdrop of incentive sensitization of drug use and cues and negative affect during nonuse. This stage is also associated with an attentional and motivational bias towards drug procurement and use over other natural rewards. The prefrontal cortex, and its glutamatergic projections are critically involved in this stage, and long-term drug use diminishes the overall activity of the prefrontal cortex. This inability to control drug use behavior is a core component of addiction and is involved in drug relapse following nonuse periods. This stage is also associated with drug craving, which is associated with the insular cortex and many other brain regions.1 EXTRA-CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM PATHWAYS While there is empirical evidence that addiction is a brain disease,1,3 addiction is also a whole-body disease (Figure 1). For example, acute/binge alcohol use upregulates the FGF21 protein in the liver, which results in diminished mesolimbic dopamine activity and decreased alcohol consumption.11 Alcohol also impacts the peripheral and central immune system, which communicates with neurons to impact negative affect during the withdrawal/negative affect stage. Toll-like receptor 4 signaling is closely associated with the inflammatory effects of alcohol and adaptations of microglia in the central nervous system.12 Alcohol-associated changes in neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone are also involved in the GABA-A potentiating effects of alcohol and interaction with Toll-like receptors.13 Alcohol damages the lining of the gut and disrupts the communication/signaling mechanisms underlying the gut-brain axis, including changes in the gut microbiome/metabolome. Furthermore, changes in gut hormones like ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that regulate feeding behavior based on energy needs are also involved in alcohol craving, seeking, and dependence.14,15 Finally, the vast majority of alcohol is metabolized in the periphery, and these metabolic products impact the nervous system and contribute to the biology of addiction.16 In conclusion, the biology underlying alcohol addiction is highly distributed and involves multiple systems and organs throughout the body. These interactions and mechanisms are not fully understood and highly complex, even more so given the apparent paradox that peripheral-brain connections seem to play important roles in the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of AUD and, at the same time, alcohol is a leading cause of multiple organ damage, including, but not limited to, alcohol-associated liver disease.17FIGURE 1: Addiction as a whole-body disorder. A simplified framework for understanding the key elements of the biological mechanisms underlying AUD and alcohol addiction. This is a conceptual adaptation of the 3-stage addiction cycle proposed in Koob and Volkow.1 This adaptation specifically focuses on alcohol addiction and emphasizes extra-CNS mechanisms involved.

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients.

The considerable increase of intoxications with substances of the chemical class of amphetamines (in particular, \"Ecstasy\") in western countries should cause major concern. Moreover, the number of schizophrenic patients who also use hallucinogenic drugs is increasing. High incidence and comorbidity cause clinical problems and call for detailed knowledge of the drug related acute and chronic effects of the various agents currently in use. Clinical findings and subjective reports from research in experimental psychoses are used to discuss differential diagnosis and types of drug-induced mental disorders within the framework of present day classificatory systems, such as DSM-IV and ICD-10.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

Consequences of CFS found include social isolation and stigmatization, physical inactivity, psychological disturb ances and a reduced quality of life. Plausible mechanism for the development of CFS is based on loss of immunological tolerance to the vasoactive neuropeptides following infection, significant physical exercise or de novo. Considerable evidence points towards a prominent role for central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CFS. Patients with CFS are described as perfectionist, conscientious, hardworking, somewhat neurotic and introverted individuals with high personal standards, a great desire to be socially accepted and with a history of continuously pushing themselves past their limits. Fewer than 20% of persons with CFS have been diagnosed and treated. Graded exercise therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy appeared to reduce symptoms and improve function based on evidence from RCTs.",

      "title": "Comorbidity of Epilepsy and Depression: Associated Pathophysiology and Management",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Depression may arise as a result of other mental or physical problems or as a side effect of the drugs used to treat such illnesses, or it could be caused by epilepsy-related structural abnormalities. However, physicians are hesitant to prescribe antidepressants to patients with epilepsy due to concerns about decreasing seizure thresholds and the harmful drug interactions between antidepressants and antiepileptic medicines. As a result, the question about the optimal care of epileptic patients who suffer from depression remains unanswered. Despite the complicated link between epilepsy and depression, the co-administration of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is safe and beneficial when appropriately managed. A focused evaluation for depression (regardless of social, economic, or personal circumstances) might identify people who benefit from medical care and therapeutic assistance. Vagus nerve stimulation and psychological therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, individual or group psychotherapy, patient support groups, family therapy, and counseling are nonpharmacological therapeutic alternatives. In terms of treatment strategy, it is critical to optimize seizure control and limit antiepileptic medications' adverse effects. Psychotherapy for depression in epilepsy is underused, even though it has been shown to be helpful in well-controlled studies. This review article has discussed some parts of the most common pathophysiologies of depression in patients with epilepsy, highlighted the efficacy of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs, and explored the optimal care of patients with epilepsy who suffer from depression.",

While their shared neurobiology is responsible for inducing the sought-after effects of euphoria and energy, subtle differences in their precise action, potency, and route of use mean their main functions and the risks associated with their use are diverse. Acute intoxication, often in combination with other substances, remains the most common risk that users face. High-risk behaviours associated with intoxication and the development of dependence are seen among a minority and require specialist assessment and treatment. Clinically, psychiatrists are most likely to see those who have developed problems with cocaine and methamphetamine, though some of the new psychostimulants that have appeared in recent years may increasingly provide patients for treatment. MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), on the other hand, may, in the lifetime of this edition, move from being seen solely as a recreational drug to one that may have significant therapeutic benefits, for those with post-traumatic stress disorder, for example.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

Morever, drug abusers have also described strong feelings of depersonalization that make PCP an impressive drug model of schizophrenia (Domino, 1981; Snyder, 1980). These disturbances in thinking have been described as \"loosening of association, overinclusive thoughts, delusional thinking, and general disorganization, all strikingly reminiscent of thought disorders of schizophrenics\" (Snyder, 1980). Thus, PCP's pharmacological profile is unlike that of any other psychoactive drug and may provide a good animal model of schizophrenia (Domino, 1981; Quirion and Pert, 1983a; Pert and Quirion, 1983).",

Each subsystem or dissociative agent brings forth his or her own, however rudimentary, experience and idea of self, world, and self as a part of this world. The disorders manifest in dissociative symptoms. Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Substance use disorder (SUD) is as a problematic pattern of use of an intoxicating substance leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. SUD is a major concern of public health given the increasing number of people that misuse drugs worldwide (nearly 271 million people in 2017). Alcohol and tobacco, which are the most used drugs, produce millions of deaths every year. Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit drug followed by amphetamine-type stimulants (including ecstasy), opioids, cocaine, benzodiazepines and an increasing number of new psychoactive substances. All known addictive drugs activate the brain reward pathway, based in the mesolimbic dopamine system, which produces euphoria and leads to the repeated administration of the drug. The continuous presence of the drug in the body induces adaptations that can result in tolerance, physical dependence and addiction. In this chapter, we will review the biological effects of the main drugs of abuse on human health with a special focus on toxicity, ranging from acute intoxication (overdose) to chronic toxicity, addiction and withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "In Italy, as in other countries, an apparently increasing number of subjects is reporting a variety of subjective symptoms that the subjects themselves refer to the exposure to electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields (EMF) from nearby electric appliances, cellular phones, antennas, etc. Terms like electricity hypersensitivity (EHS), EMF hypersensitivity, or other similar, are frequently adopted to describe such symptoms; nevertheless, up to now, these terms are not entered the medical terminology. No accepted diagnostic criteria or procedures for the diagnosis of EHS are currently available. Furthermore, apart from the subject's self-attribution of the symptoms to EMFs, no direct cause-effect relationship between EHS symptoms and electromagnetic fields has been proved; additionally, evidence of a possible pathogenetic mechanism is lacking. In this paper, two cases developing symptoms of EHS ascribed to overhead power line in the proximity of their house are discussed. Nervous system (asthenia, depression, paraesthesias etc.), cardiovascular system (cardiac palpitations) and the skin (tingling, itching, etc.), are mostly (but not exclusively) involved. Based on available scientific knowledge, the rationale for an approach to subjects claiming for EHS is discussed. The establishment of a National archive for the collection of cases is communicated.",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

The end result is a constellation of findings bearing similarity to physical abuse and neglect. There may be injuries including bruising and fractures, signs of dehydration and malnutrition, presence of decubitus ulcers, poor hygiene in the context of unsanitary living conditions. Underlying psychiatric conditions affecting decision making capacity may be implicated. Normal aging process of organ systems and increased geriatric comorbidities render them vulnerable to accidental injuries and delayed management of treatable medical conditions in an isolated home environment. During medicolegal investigation, it is essential to identify features that differentiate from genuine elder maltreatment. Diogenes Syndrome is an extreme form of fatal self-neglect for individuals in social isolation with hoarding of rubbish or household items. This presents considerable forensic difficulties because of the mysterious circumstances, a lack of medical history, suspicious findings on the body including purging of putrefactive fluids and injuries following falls or post-mortem animal predation in a chaotic scene.",

A seven-step strategy for handling non-responders is proposed. 1) Always start by checking that the drug is actually used. 2) Then the diagnosis should be reconsidered. If “organic” causes can be ruled out, 3) consider high-dosage treatment combined with 4) plasma concentration monitoring. 5) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be the treatment of choice in several cases. The alternatives to ECT are 6) to change to another type of drug or 7) to combine two antidepressants with different biochemical actions or combine an antidepressant with other pharmacologic agents or specific psychologic therapies. The latter step is discussed with special reference to the often successful combination of a “presynaptic” (mianserin) and “synaptic” drug (such as monoamine-reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors). The usefulness of using this drug combination in treating difficult psychosomatic cases is als...",

      "abstract": "La toxicité cérébrale du cannabis est marquée principalement par des effets cognitifs, addictifs et psychotomimétiques. Troubles cognitifs Plusieurs études ont montré que l’administration aiguë de Δ-9-THC, principal principe actif du cannabis, et que la consommation régulière de cannabis entraînaient des troubles de l’attention, de la mémoire, en particulier de la mémoire de travail et de la mémoire épisodique ainsi que des troubles des fonctions exécutives. Ces troubles ont un impact sur l’apprentissage, les acquisitions scolaires, la conduite d’un véhicule et les tâches complexes. Ils sont liés à la dose, à la fréquence, à la durée d’exposition et à l’âge de la première consommation. Ils peuvent disparaître après sevrage, mais des anomalies durables s’observent chez les sujets ayant débuté leur consommation avant l’âge de 15 ans. Effets addictifs La fréquence sur la vie entière de la dépendance au cannabis, caractérisée essentiellement par le craving , la perte de contrôle de la consommation et le retentissement important sur la vie familiale/professionnelle/sociale est, d’après certaines études, de 1 % en population générale. Le syndrome de sevrage, décrit en 2004, pourrait être inclus dans le DSM-5. Effets psychotomimétiques Fréquents, les symptômes psychotiques induits par la consommation de cannabis (idées de référence, de persécution) disparaissent spontanément dans les 24 heures. Ils durent parfois plusieurs semaines dans les pharmacopsychoses. Neuf études longitudinales ont montré que les sujets qui avaient fumé du cannabis avaient deux fois plus de risque environ que les sujets abstinents, de présenter ultérieurement des troubles psychotiques. Le risque, dose-dépendant, est plus élevé lorsque la consommation de cannabis a débuté avant l’âge de 15 ans et chez les sujets qui ont des antécédents familiaux de troubles psychotiques. L’évolution de la schizophrénie est aggravée par la consommation de cannabis. Toxicité cérébrale du cannabis Elle est liée à l’interaction du Δ-9-THC sur les récepteurs cannabinoïdes cérébraux CB1, localisés principalement dans l’hippocampe, le cervelet, le cortex frontal, le striatum et les ganglions de la base. Plusieurs études ont retrouvé que la consommation de cannabis pouvait interférer avec le système endocannabinoïde cérébral lors de la maturation du cerveau à l’adolescence. Elle favorise aussi des troubles vasculaires cérébraux. Les études d’imagerie cérébrale ont retrouvé que les effets du cannabis, modérés en cas d’usage simple, étaient marqués chez les consommateurs réguliers par une diminution dose-dépendante de la densité de substance grise au niveau de l’hippocampe, des régions parahippocampiques et de l’amygdale.",

Dependence, either physical or psychic, is not an essential feature of drug addiction.\n\nThe most important factor which predisposes to drug addiction is a personality disorder. In addition to the personality disorder, contact with a drug which produces mental reactions that are regarded as pleasurable is necessary. Contact with the drug as a result of curiosity about the pleasurable effects is a much more potent factor in inducing addiction than is contact as a result of legitimate medical administration.\n\nAnimal methods have only a limited place in determining the addiction liability of new drugs. Dogs and monkeys are the best species to use for such experiments. The final determination of the addiction liability of any new analgesic drug is dependent upon experimentation or clinical observations with human beings.\n\nThere is no drug in the morphine series which is known to be an effective analgesic that does not also possess addiction liability. The addiction liabilities of compounds of the morphine series generally parallel the analgesic potencies of the drugs. However, it is possible that some separation of addiction liability and analgesic potency has been achieved in the compound 6-methyldihydromorphine. N-allylnormorphine does not produce physical dependence in man, but it is not known whether this drug is an effective analgesic.\n\nThere are also no known compounds in either the meperidine or methadone series which do not possess addiction liability. Addiction to meperidine is fairly common and physical dependence can be developed in individuals who have never been previously addicted to any other analgesic drug. Addiction to meperidine, because of the toxic effects of the drug, is more undesirable than addiction to morphine.\n\nRecent neurophysiological investigations have shown that the spinal cord, and probably other parts of the central nervous system, are involved in physical dependence on morphine. Physical dependence is not entirely due to changes in the autonomic nervous system.\n\nThe theory that the manifestations of abstinence are due to the stimulant effects of morphine outlasting the depressant effects is probably not tenable. The most satisfactory theory of dependence at the present time is that certain homeostatic responses, which oppose some of the actions of morphine, are enhanced by repeated administration of the drug. When morphine is withdrawn, these enhanced physiological counter-responses are still operative and, therefore, signs of abstinence appear. The mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of the homeostatic responses are unknown.\n\nDuring addiction to morphine and other analgesics, the electroencephalogram is characterized by general slowing. Following withdrawal the electroencephalogram returns to normal.\n\nIt has not been established that partial tolerance to certain actions of morphine persists for long periods of time following withdrawal of the drug. Furthermore, it has not been established that individuals who have been addicted to one analgesic drug will develop physical dependence on another analgesic drug any more rapidly than a comparable individual without addiction experience.\n\nThere is no real evidence that addiction to morphine produces permanent anatomical damage to the central nervous system. Morphine addiction does not produce any permanent impairment of intelligence.\n\nTreatment of morphine addiction involves withdrawal of the drug followed by a long period of rehabilitative and psychiatric therapy. Withdrawal of morphine is very easy to accomplish provided adequate environmental control of the addict can be achieved. The best and only rational method of withdrawal consists of the administration of decreasing doses of either morphine or some equivalent drug. The results of treatment of addiction, although not completely satisfactory, are much better than is commonly thought.\n\nBarbiturates are addicting drugs no matter how the word addicting is defined. In fact, addiction to barbiturates is far more dangerous and harmful than is addiction to morphine or other analgesic drugs. Barbiturate addiction is apparently increasing in the United States.\n\nThe clinical picture of chronic barbiturate intoxication resembles that of chronic intoxication with alcohol and is characterized by impairment of mental ability, impairment of emotional control, psychic regression and dangerous neurological symptoms.\n\nWithdrawal of barbiturates from individuals chronically intoxicated with those drugs is followed by a very definite and severe type of abstinence syndrome which is characterized chiefly by the appearance of convulsions and delirium.\n\nPhysical recovery from chronic barbiturate intoxication in man is, so far as can be judged by clinical and psychological examination, complete unless the addict incurs an accidental injury during chronic intoxication or during a convulsion in withdrawal.\n\nThe barbiturate abstinence syndrome has been produced experimentally in dogs.\n\nChronic barbiturate poisoning in animals is accompanied by definite pathological changes in the central nervous system.\n\nThe mechanism of symptoms of abstinence from barbiturates is unknown.\n\nTreatment of chronic barbiturate intoxication consists in a very careful gradual withdrawal of the drug followed by a long period of rehabilitative and psychiatric therapy.",

Barbiturate addiction is apparently increasing in the United States.\n\nThe clinical picture of chronic barbiturate intoxication resembles that of chronic intoxication with alcohol and is characterized by impairment of mental ability, impairment of emotional control, psychic regression and dangerous neurological symptoms.\n\nWithdrawal of barbiturates from individuals chronically intoxicated with those drugs is followed by a very definite and severe type of abstinence syndrome which is characterized chiefly by the appearance of convulsions and delirium.\n\nPhysical recovery from chronic barbiturate intoxication in man is, so far as can be judged by clinical and psychological examination, complete unless the addict incurs an accidental injury during chronic intoxication or during a convulsion in withdrawal.\n\nThe barbiturate abstinence syndrome has been produced experimentally in dogs.\n\nChronic barbiturate poisoning in animals is accompanied by definite pathological changes in the central nervous system.\n\nThe mechanism of symptoms of abstinence from barbiturates is unknown.\n\nTreatment of chronic barbiturate intoxication consists in a very careful gradual withdrawal of the drug followed by a long period of rehabilitative and psychiatric therapy.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs, It is most commonly reported with combinations of serotonergic medications. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

The right dose differentiates a poison from a remedy.’’ 1 Many drugs of abuse encountered by emergency physicians (EP) are also therapeutic agents. However, when these drugs are taken in excess or recreationally to obtain a ‘‘high,’’ the inherent toxicity becomes apparent. Many substances taken in overdose cause an alteration in mental status. Agents as diverse as carbon monoxide, cyanide, and antiepileptic drugs can lead to life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) depression. Pharmaceuticals such as methylxanthines and drugs used for attention-deficit disorder can lead to severe agitation, delirium, and seizures. Some of these drugs may be abused. As Paracelsus articulated, any toxin in an extreme dose can lead to poisoning. Altered mental status commonly plays a part with toxicity. However, discussion in this review is restricted to drugs of abuse (Table 1).",

      "title": "Chronic Psychosis in Dual Disorder Heroin Use Disorder Patients",
      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, manic or depressive episodes and mixed states are frequently marked by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, psychosis may occur after substance use disorder, often intervening with the effect of making the clinical picture indistinguishable from that of a primary psychosis. Cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, alcohol and poly-use most commonly develop psychosis induced by the non-medical use of substances. Among substance use disorder users, it has not yet been ascertained whether opioids exert a psychotic effect. Still, some authors have supported the view that opioids have antidepressant, antipanic and antipsychotic effects. It has also been hypothesized that affective disorders, coupled with genetic disposition rather than affective disturbance or psychosis, result in bipolar psychosis or schizoaffective disorder, respectively. In the history of chronic psychotics, heroin use is relatively infrequent. Chronic use of psychotogenic substances and autonomous chronicity of psychotic symptoms may root in a bipolar substrate. Substance use among people with schizophrenia cannot always be justified in terms of dysphoria. Still, the number of depressive symptoms can significantly influence the risk rate for alcohol, cannabinoid use or poly-use. Dual disorder psychotic heroin-addicted patients usually enter treatment with more severe psychopathological aspects and a shorter, less severe addiction history than their non-psychotic peers suggesting that these patients are likely to benefit from opioid medication. These data indirectly confirm the antipsychotic effects of opioids and Khantzian's self-medication hypothesis. For further confirmation, patients affected by chronic psychosis and anxiety disorders tend to progress from a psychiatric disorder to a substance use disorder. In contrast, patients with mood disorders are initially affected by drug addiction. As far as dual disorder is concerned, it is advisable to employ agents that do not heavily affect dopamine metabolism in an inhibitory way since the worsening of use hampers the effectiveness upon psychotic symptoms. On the other hand, when the tie with substances is more robust, their use may amplify as a direct consequence of dopamine antagonism, as a compensatory mechanism effective throughout the reward pathway. Novel antipsychotics seem to permit equivalent effectiveness on psychotic symptoms without promoting drug use, at least to the same extent, and might have anticraving properties.",

CFS is classified by the Department of Health (DH) as a long-term neurological condition. In CFS the symptoms of fatigue are not caused by any other known medical conditions. The condition is also sometimes refered to as post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) or chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS) when it follows a flu-like infection, or as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Most clinicians use the terms CFS and ME interchangeably to refer to chronic post-viral fatigue (Gallagher et al, 2004). However, certain groups have argued for ME to be recognized as a separate condition, but this is controversial (Wyller, 2007). In this aritcle ‘CFS’ will be used as an umbrella term.",

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento. El propósito de esta revisión es clarificar criterios diagnósticos, y exponer un manejo progresivo de enfrentamiento y tratamiento, con un enfoque multidisciplinario, sin ahondar en la resolución de las causas médicas orgánicas.",

In this chapter, some classic histologic findings in acute and chronic poisoning (including substance abuse) are presented. The determination of cause and manner of death in a poisoning requires a careful summation of circumstance, toxicology, and autopsy. Toxicology results are usually necessary, but alone are not sufficient for forming an opinion on cause and manner. Many variables, including postmortem redistribution, post-exposure survival, and overlap between therapeutic and toxic ranges, introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of postmortem drug levels. Gross and microscopic findings at autopsy can be supportive of acute and/or chronic substance abuse or may show unexpected sequelae of chronic substance abuse (e.g., infective endocarditis). Sometimes histology may be the first clue in a case of poisoning. An example of this is finding oxalate crystals in the kidneys of an otherwise unremarkable autopsy, as ethylene glycol is not detected by most toxicology laboratories in routine screening.",

At present, a broad range of cognitive behavior, psychosocial, and psychodynamic therapies should remain on the agenda.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced sleep disorders are classified into the following subtypes: a) insomnia, b) hypersomnia, c) pathological sleep d) others, those caused by medicine which can effect on circadian rhythm or sleep apnea. This paper described the relationship between several medical agents (neuroleptics, anti-depressants, anti-anxietics, anti-convulsants, psychostimulants, and drugs other than CNS-effective agents) and those effect on sleep and sleep stages. In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

Cerca de 50% de la poblacion lo padece, y es un problema que se asocia con una serie de alteraciones: disminucion de la capacidad fisica, problemas de concentracion y atencion, multiples patologias se exacerban, lo que acaba produciendo una disminucion de la calidad de vida de la personas. Asi mismo se interrelaciona con multiples problemas tanto fisicos, como psicologicos y sociales que pueden agravar o ser causa a su vez de las alteraciones del sueno. Reconocer los problemas del sueno y clasificarlos adecuadamente permite determinar la necesidad o no de estudios complementarios, seleccionar el manejo mas adecuado en forma individual, recomendar el manejo no farmacologico (terapia cognitivo conductual, manejo del ambiente), y si fuera necesario, determinar el tipo de farmaco mas adecuado en funcion de la asociacion existente con otras patologias (enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica [EPOC], depresion, ansiedad, sindrome de piernas inquietas, etc.). La pequena revision que se presenta tiene como objetivo presentar al medico general las bases para enfrentarse al paciente adulto mayor que padece de alteraciones del sueno.

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is used for addiction to alcohol, opioids, or nicotine and is usually offered in combination with behavioral therapy and/or mutual support program participation. Medications can play a major role in facilitating initial abstinence, reducing relapse risk, and increasing the likelihood of the client maintaining longer periods of abstinence.

The first patient had also used cocaine, cannabis and alcohol, while the second patient had only used the hallucinogenic mushrooms. Both patients were treated symptomatically and survived despite their severe stab wounds. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used as mind-altering drugs. These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic. The diagnosis ofpsilocybin intoxication is hampered by the lack of routinely available, rapid and sensitive, analytical methods for the quantification ofpsilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin.",

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Serotonin toxicity, often referred to as ‘serotonin syndrome,’ is a drug-induced condition due to excess serotonin released from brain synapses, resulting in symptoms that may be autonomic, neuromuscular, and/or cognitive in nature. Most cases involve more than 1 of the following drug regimens: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), serotonin releasers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This report is of a 70-year-old woman who presented with confusion and muscle spasms due to serotonin toxicity associated with paroxetine and quetiapine treatment. CASE REPORT:An elderly woman with dementia presented to the Emergency Department with fever, altered mental status, labile blood pressures, and inducible clonus. No known medication dosage increases had been made, nor had any new serotonergic agents been added to the patient’s drug regimen. She underwent a thorough workup in the Emergency Department and later during her hospitalization. A presumptive diagnosis of serotonin toxicity was made early on during her stay, with the etiology attributed to use of paroxetine and quetiapine. Clinical improvement was observed after benzodiazepine administration, discontinuation of offending agents, and a brief cyproheptadine course. The patient survived her hospital stay and was ultimately discharged to hospice care with a return to her baseline level of functioning. CONCLUSIONS:Diagnosing serotonin toxicity requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and can occur in the absence of increased dosage of existing, or initiation of new, serotonergic agents.",

      "abstract": "Current concepts of schizophrenia and its treatment are discussed. Schizophrenia entails negative symptoms, such as behavioral and cognitive deficits, attributed to loss of normal functions, and positive, or florid, symptoms that originate from the disturbed function of the remainder of the brain. Schizophrenia type I has positive symptoms predominating, and schizophrenia type II has negative symptoms predominating. Many atypical antipsychotics are now in Phase II and Phase III development; the prototype, clozapine, is now available. These agents challenge traditional views about drug treatment in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia may be explained by a persistent impairment in one or more neurotransmitter or neuromodulatory regulatory mechanisms, resulting in unstable or erratic neurotransmission. A more complex conceptualization of the role of the dopaminergic system makes it possible to understand the lack of biochemical tolerance to the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics, the varied time to onset of effects and prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms, and the differences in efficacy within and among patients. Drug selection on the basis of patient-specific biological markers and neuropsychological function might expedite treatment responses. Drug therapy should augment homeostatic mechanisms and restore appropriate dopaminergic responses to physiological stimuli. Atypical antipsychotics may act by stabilizing presynaptic activity at a new set point, activating prefrontal dopaminergic systems and inhibiting mesolimbic systems, or exerting pharmacologic or functional effects on other neurotransmitter and neuropeptidergic systems. The traditional view that schizophrenia is simply a manifestation of dopaminergic overactivity is inadequate. New investigative techniques and the study of atypical antipsychotics suggest that a dysregulation hypothesis may be more consistent with the complexities of schizophrenia.",

Phenomena of amnesia, dementia/delirium, mental retardation, biased perception, chemical/behavioural addiction, delusion, misidentification, mania, depression, suicide, anxiety, obsession-compulsion, conversion, disso - ciation, para/hyper/insomnia, sexual and personality disorders are listed as examples from the wide repertoire. The figure of the 'fool' and the topic of 'madness' (in general, and folia, tarantella) are mentioned as well as the appearance of some behavioural traits ('seven deadly sins'), feigning psychic/somatic states, pathological lying, mutism, stutterism, famous oracles, mesmerism, and employing magic or various potions. Mad scenes as psychotic conditions (often tran - sient if due to psychotrauma from romantic love) occur in many operas. However, quite a few of them have been written by Donizetti. Considering his life, behaviour and composing features, the question arises about Donizetti's ailment: was it mood disorder, Barbaja, or luetic derailment?",

Such patients have a more fragile mental status which can be adversely affected by psychoactive substances of abuse. In addition, most such patients need to take potent psychiatric medications which themselves may interact with substances.

      "abstract": "espanolLa depresion es la enfermedad psiquiatrica mas frecuente en los pacientes de edad avan- zada. Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta. En este articulo se pretende revisar las posibles evolu- ciones y sus opciones terapeuticas, abordar si existe riesgo de encarnizamiento terapeutico, y finalizar con algunas cuestiones de la vida de estos pacientes que influyen en el afronta- miento de la enfermedad EnglishDepression is the most frequent psychia- tric illness in elderly patients. It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

A tree may decline because of damage by secondary agents after an injurious event such as defoliation or major wounding. The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4. Trees of similar age growing in groups tend to display group behaviour including premature senescence (synchronous cohort senescence) in response to stress.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been originally described as a disorder of childhood and adolescence. In the last years, a huge amount of evidence supports a syndromal continuity form childhood to adulthood. the identification of ADHD in adults raises several problems of differential diagnosis and the disorder is frequently associated with other mental disorders, at least in patients referred to psychiatric settings. It is not clear if adult ADHD is characterized by a specific pattern of symptoms that include attentive deficits and consequent behavioral manifestations, instead of hyperactivity. Comorbidity with other mental disorders influences clinical picture, severity, course and treatment outcome. In particular comorbid ADHD, bipolar disorder and alcohol/substance abuse disorders coexist in a relevant proportion of cases and it might represent a specific phenoptype, associated with treatment resistance. Substances use, often poly-drug abuse, such as alcohol, cocaine, stimulants and heroin, inevitably complicates course and therapeutic choice. The recognition of ADHD in adults has important implications at therapeutic level, even when present as incomplete and residual forms. Psychostimulants and other compounds with specific efficacy on ADHD symptomatology has been shown to be useful also in adults both in monotherapy and in association with other drugs, such as mood stabilizers. However their use should be cautious when a mood disorder coexists, for the possible induction of manic-switches or rapid cycling. Further research is necessary in order to better characterize the clinical picture of ADHD in adults and to elaborate widely shared treatment guidelines.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

Assessment focused on the interaction and impact of the comorbidity for the individual patient, rather than trying to determine which is primary, is likely to be beneficial for both patient and clinician.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

      "title": "Potential Adverse Effects of Discontinuing Psychotropic Drugs",
      "abstract": "Understanding the particular pharmacology of different antidepressant drugs can help explain their adverse effects when they are discontinued. For all antidepressant drugs, abruptly stopping them can sometimes result in “rebound” hypomania or mania. Antidepressant drugs having anticholinergic effects often are associated with a discontinuation syndrome characterized by cholinergic rebound, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, sweating, headache, and muscle spasms. Discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs sometimes results in flu-like symptoms, dysphoria, restlessness, tachycardia, hypertension, and a delirium-like state. Serotonergic antidepressant drugs are sometimes associated with a distinct discontinuation syndrome characterized by dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. Adverse discontinuation effects can occur with all types of antidepressant drugs, but only rarely would they be considered serious. To minimize adverse discontinuation effects and to reduce the risk of relapse or recurrence of the underlying treated condition, tapering antidepressant medication is prudent for all patients.",

Dizziness is a common symptom of FSS. Generally, clinical examination in these cases is inconclusive. The complaints of these patients usually persist until a satisfactory treatment is administered. For the treatment of cases with FSS, first, signs of underlying psychological distress should be identified during history taking. It is essential to address the psychosocial aspect in these cases from a medical point of view. Drug therapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is therefore prescribed. Next, psychotherapy should be introduced. The final strategy usually is to collaborate with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.",

      "title": "Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy: Pathogenetic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications",
      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

      "abstract": "La diffusione epidemica di nuove sostanze psicoattive (NPS) nella popolazione giovanile si sta traducendo in un incremento di sintomatologie a carattere psicotico, molte delle quali necessitano di ricovero in SPDC. Le NPS, infatti, di derivazione sono a base di stimolanti, dissociativi e/o allucinogeni. Non essendo i SerT in grado di far fronte a questo ingravescente fenomeno, ne nella fase acuta, ne nella post-acuzie, questi pazienti, ove mai la sintomatologia non receda dopo un congruo periodo di tempo, finiscono per essere assorbiti nella filiera della psichiatrizzazione: revolving in SPDC, comunita residenziali e strutture intermedie. In non pochi casi la destinazione diventa il carcere a causa di reati connessi all’abuso di sostanze. Questo lavoro mira ad isolare una tipologia di indotta da sostanze che l’autore definisce psicosi sintetica, per distinguerla dalle classiche, o endogene, schizofreniche o affettive, l’essenza della quale consiste, in una prospettiva fenomenologica, nell’avere sintomi psicotici, non nell’essere psicotici. La disamina psicopatologica e condotta dall’Autore basandosi su di un caso clinico paradigmatico, il Caso G., etichettato come schizofrenico paranoide, il cui universo delirante si mostra reattivo ad un sistema di percezioni alterate dal costante utilizzo di sostanze. In assenza di riscontri neurobiologici l’Autore ritiene che solo un’accurata semeiotica psicopatologica del caso singolo possa guidare il clinico nella diagnosi differenziale e nella impostazione del trattamento,con sviluppi prognostici spesso piu favorevoli rispetto alle tradizionali, e, in ogni caso, meritevoli di diversa attenzione. Il pericolo di un abuso della diagnosi categoriale psichiatrica (DSM-5 o ICD 10) applicata ai pazienti abusatori di sostanze e che i dati epidemiologici sull’andamento delle avranno un’impennata, e che il sistema della Salute mentale si trovera nelle condizioni di sovraccaricarsi di pazienti che, fondamentalmente, sono affetti da organiche, secondarie alle sostanze, dunque esogene, e pertanto bisognosi di trattamenti psico-riabilitativi specifici.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT People with schizophrenia are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than people in the general population. Several biological and environmental factors could interact to account for high smoking persistence in this population, including increased sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of nicotine or conditioned cues, beneficial effects of nicotine on symptoms or cognitive function, higher levels of craving or negative affect during abstinence, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms during abstinence, and reduced motivation, self-efficacy or support for quitting. Controlled comparisons of responses to abstinence, cues and nicotine replacement in smokers with schizophrenia and equally-dependent smokers who do not have psychiatric illness may help to clarify the degree to which these biological and environmental factors may contribute to smoking persistence in people with schizophrenia.

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a chronic disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and likely to become the second most debilitating disease worldwide by 2020. As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition (DSM‐IV), depression is the persistent presence over a period of at least two weeks of at least five of nine of its cardinal symptoms: depressed mood and anhedonia (of which at least one must be present), clinically significant weight gain/loss or increase/decrease in appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or of excessive guilt, decrease in concentration, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Culture can influence numerous processes interfacing with this disorder, including symptom presentation, prevalence, utilization of services, and selection of and response to treatment.",

The 17-year-old male after only a few marihuana cigarettes, the 22-year-old patient after two years of addiction developed schizoid psychosis; the 20-year-old patient after six years of cannabis addiction had schizoaffective psychosis. The first two patients become symptom-free on the antipsychotics and during the drug-free period. The third patient, who had cannabis during the psychotic symptoms, still has the schizoid psychosis.The connection between cannabis and psychosis is clear in our three patients. Marihuana is working on the dopamine system and may cause schizoid psychosis, sometimes permanent psychosis. Cannabis, this light drug might not be a \"safe\" agent.",

      "title": "Novel Psychoactive Substances as a Vital and Ever-Changing Concern in Public Health",
      "abstract": "Summary New/novel psychoactive substances (NPS) are substances of varying chemical structures and, in their physical forms, are taken and ingested and exhibit many diverse drug interactions. They are used in pure form and/or as mixtures of psychoactive substances, also often combined with other drugs or ethyl alcohol, which can change how receptors function, whether they be adrenergic, serotonergic, or dopaminergic, opioid and/or cannabinoid. Identifying NPS users is difficult because of the constantly changing range of new drugs available, which poses analytical challenges in finding sufficiently advanced methods for their measurement in a biological fluid (i.e. blood, urine and saliva) under clinical conditions. The term toxidrome is used to cover adverse groups of signs and symptoms arising from the toxic effects of chemicals found in the body. For NPS, these include sympathomimetic, anticholinergic, opioid and cholinergic effects, which in health-rescue situations can confuse and hinder point-of-care delivery by enhancing or partially eliminating symptoms. The NPS include stimulants, synthetic opioids, dissociative anaesthetics, synthetic cannabinoids and unclassified substances. Acute poisoning can also be fatal, primarily when taking synthetic opioids. There is still a poor understanding of the long-term somatic and psychological complications of abusing NPS and any treatment options for addicts. It is, therefore, necessary to expand those prophylactic measures targeted at various social groups to prevent the spread of NPS.",

Antipsychotic drugs play a critical role in the management of schizophrenia; however, conventional drugs are not always effective, tend to improve positive symptoms more than negative, have a high incidence of neurologic adverse effects, and are associated with high rates of noncompliance. A series of new drugs have been introduced in the 1990s and several others are likely to be available in the near future. These compounds have somewhat different properties, including receptor binding profiles. In general, they appear to have better adverse effect profiles than many conventional drugs. The degree to which the new compounds are clinically superior to conventional drugs (or each other) in terms of improving positive or negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and long-term outcome will require further study.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

Signs and symptoms of AW can include, among others, mild to moderate tremors, irritability, anxiety, or agitation. The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures. These manifestations result from alcohol-induced imbalances in the brain chemistry that cause excessive neuronal activity if the alcohol is withheld. Management of AW includes thorough assessment of the severity of the patient's symptoms and of any complicating conditions as well as treatment of the withdrawal symptoms with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Treatment can occur in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Recognition and treatment of withdrawal can represent a first step in the patient's recovery process.",

En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

In our non-narcotic drug too, there are many drugs which lead to addiction. In this pandemic even many people have gone for immunity boosting tablets without knowing its side effect. Non narcotic drug abuse can also be done because of depression, anxiety, mental disorder etc. People actually start taking a lot of medicine for depression but they are not known about the adverse effect of those medicines on their CNS and visceral organs. The present study was conducted to get an idea of drug addiction in people in the society via a survey. Result revealed maximum people opt for taking medicine by their own without consulting doctor were they are maybe known about the work of the drug but unknown about the composition, dosage, how long to continue, etc &amp; there they go for the harmful side effect of those drugs. Even the heavy use of non-narcotic analgesic is paralleled with the high risk of depression, emotional liability, etc. Drug use is dangerous it can harm your brain and body as well. Here, herbal medicine plays a marvellous role in treating the ill without showing any toxic effect. In early stages the signs of medicine developed around those plants which had curative properties. A continued search for medicinal plant during the last several centuries has given rise to a long list of plants which are of great use in the treatment of diseases &amp; promoting health. [1].",

      "title": "The epidemiology and patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with recreational ketamine use",
      "abstract": "Ketamine was originally synthesised for use as a dissociative anaesthetic, and it remains widely used legitimately for this indication. However, there is increasing evidence of non-medical recreational use of ketamine, particularly in individuals who frequent the night-time economy. The population-level and sub-population (clubbers) prevalence of recreational use of ketamine is not known but is likely to be similar, or slightly lower than, that of other recreational drugs such as cocaine, MDMA, and amphetamine. The predominant features of acute toxicity associated with the recreational use of ketamine are neuro-behavioural abnormalities such as agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, and psychosis. Secondary to these, individuals put themselves at greater risk of physical harm/trauma. Cardiovascular features (hypertension and tachycardia) occur less frequently and the risk of death from recreational use is low and is predominately due to the physical harm/trauma. Long-term recreational use of ketamine can be associated with the development of psychological dependence and tolerance. There are reports of gastro-intestinal toxicity, particularly abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests, and of neuropsychiatric disorders, typically a schizophrenia-like syndrome, in long-term users. Finally, there are increasing reports of urological disorders, particularly haemorrhagic cystitis, associated with long-term use. The management of these problems associated with the long-term use of ketamine is largely supportive and abstinence from ongoing exposure to ketamine. In this review we will collate the available information on the epidemiology of recreational use of ketamine and describe the patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with its recreational use and the management of this toxicity.",

The use of appropriate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding and definitions could usefully differentiate these groups - the former is a drug-induced psychosis and the latter frequently presents as comorbid schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (often attracting a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder). The current established differentiation between early onset ('stress-sensitive' - 'Kraepelinian' schizophrenia) and later onset (DSM5 delusional disorder, i.e. with 'non-bizarreness' criterion removed) psychosis may also be worthy of further investigation to establish validity and reliability. Psychosocially descriptive terms have been found to be more acceptable to patients and perceived as less stigmatizing by others.

      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

The onset of symptoms within 1 month (ICD) and 3 months (DSM) is not evidence based. The symptoms may be depressive, anxious, behavioural, or a mixture of these. A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning. It is unclear whether those diagnosed with AD using the new criteria will be the same clinically as those currently so diagnosed.",

COVID-19 patients may develop a myriad of acute medical problems (linked to the virus per se, or as con-sequences of the invasive procedures), which can cause acute, post-acute and long-term conse-quences requiring rehabilitation. Information about short and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 indicate an increasing need for rehabilitation. The paper is focused on two main aspects: rehabil-itation of the severe neurological disabilities that occurred during the acute phase and continu-ing in the chronic phase (i.e., different neurological sensory-motor and cognitive deficits sec-ondary to stroke, encephalitis, seizures, encephalopathies). The other main issue is generated by the disruption of regular rehabilitation in people with neurological disabilities and chronic dis-eases (people living with sequels after stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis) due to quarantine, social isolation, movement restriction, and other healthcare systems ’disruptions. Methods Internet literature search (Lit Covid and PubMed) using the following keywords (Covid-19, Coronavirus, neurological complications, rehabilitation). During 2020-2021 were published 88 papers (in 2020 = 54, and in 2021= 54), with 21 reviewes (2020 = 15; 2021 = 8), and 2 systematic reviews, refearing neuroreabilitation in Covid-19 subacutre and long-term cas-es. Discussion REH-COVER Cochrane Rehabilitation WHO initiative (“Rapid Living Systematic Reviews Second Edition, called 2020”), contains the main cornerstones for a tailored rehabilita-tion programme, the best (current) available rehabilitation evidence on recovery interventions, for the patients living with sequelae of COVID-19. Conclusions More than two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is obvious that rehabilitation services play a crucial role in post-COVID recovery trajectories. A further achievement of research and evidence focussed on the clinical management, comprehensive treatments, and efficacy need to be targeted on short and long-term (neuro)-rehabilitation service models of care, for COVID-19 survivors.

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements. Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

      "title": "Opioid Treatment of Chronic Nonmalignant Pain1",
      "abstract": "The use of opiates to manage chronic pain originating from cancer or its treatment is well established clinical practice founded on a number of controlled clinical studies [1,2]. Recently, the treatment of various nonmalignant chronic pain syndromes with opioids has been proposed based on an accumulation of case reports and uncontrolled open studies [3-10]. In some of those reports, the authors are remarkably enthusiastic, but in others the conclusions are rather cautious [3,11,12]. The only consensus is that opioid tolerance, physical dependence or addiction seldom cause difficulties [6]. With regard to the efficacy of opioid treatment, however, many authors merely conclude either that only a small subpopulation of patients with chronic noncancer pain obtain partial pain reduction [11], or that opioids neither substantially improve nor undermine the patient's function [5]. With regard to side effects, some uncontrolled reports neither demonstrate nor exclude a risk of neuropsychologic impairment and other untoward effects [5]. A preliminary controlled study shows significantly disabled cognitive and psychomotor functioning, as well as typical opioid side effects such as constipation and nausea [13]. Thus, the conclusions from these preliminary and uncontrolled reports are ambivalent at best. The aim of this article is to review the available controlled studies that have examined the efficacy and/or adverse side effects of opioids in chronic nonmalignant pain. Controlled Efficacy Studies Several studies have tested the effects of short courses of opioid administration against placebo. In some of these trials, opioids were given intravenously for up to one hour [14-17]. In the other studies, one single dose was given orally [18] or twice daily doses were given orally over seven days [19]. Arner and Meyerson [14] differentiated between nociceptive (e.g., from pancreatitis or nephrolithiasis), neuropathic pain, and idiopathic pain (i.e., without demonstrable organic pathology). They found that various opioids (buprenorphine, morphine, ketobemidone, meperidine, pentazocine), given in test infusions of 15 minutes' duration, effectively alleviated nociceptive but not neuropathic or idiopathic pain. Kupers et al. [15] found that morphine, given in divided intravenous doses over a period of 50 minutes, reduced affective but not sensory scores of neuropathic pain and did not alter idiopathic pain. Three studies examined patients with postherpetic neuralgia: Max et al. [18] found no effects of oral codeine, Eide et al. [17] found no pain relief but inhibition of allodynia by intravenous morphine, Rowbotham et al. [16] reported significant reductions of pain and allodynia following one-hour infusions of 20 mg morphine. In patients with rheumatic, back, and other skeletal pain syndromes, Arkinstall et al. [19] found that average daily doses of 273 mg of oral codeine significantly decreased subjective pain intensity levels, consumption of rescue analgesics, and disability scores. All of these studies reported significant side effects. These findings suggest that opioids may be effective in some types of neuropathic or nociceptive pain but not in idiopathic pain. However, in all of these trials, opioids were given only over short periods of time, and this fact greatly limits the conclusions that may be drawn therefrom. There is only one placebo-controlled study investigating the long-term use of opioids in chronic noncancer pain [20]. In this investigation, patients with chronic regional pain of soft tissue or musculoskeletal origin who had not responded to codeine, antiinflammatory drugs, and antidepressants, received a sustained-release preparation of oral morphine up to 60 mg twice daily over a period of 11 weeks. Aside from subjective pain levels and the consumption of rescue medication, psychological features, including anxiety and depression, were assessed using a battery of psychological tests and questionnaires. Quality of life issues, functional status, cognition, and the propensity to psychological dependence or addiction were also evaluated. The 46 patients who completed the study used an average daily dose of 83 mg morphine and showed a significant reduction in pain intensity relative to placebo. However, no significant differences in any of the other variables were detected, including a lack of overall patient preference of morphine. The authors concluded that morphine may confer analgesic benefit with a low risk of addiction but is unlikely to yield psychological or functional improvement. Assessing the Entire Patient What are the reasons for the low efficacy of opioids in idiopathic and other kinds of chronic nonmalignant pain, and why are there so few controlled long-term studies? The unimpressive performance of morphine in the trial by Moulin et al. [20] led the authors to question whether opioids could produce an analgesic response if there were a major affective component to the pain, or if learned pain behavior is the main problem. The central point to keep in mind is that the whole patient must be evaluated, not just the pain [21]. Pain is not only a symptom of underlying tissue injury (i.e., nociception), but the combination of subjective experiences, including noxious sensations (which may occur with or without nociception), suffering (i.e., affective and emotional responses to distress or perceived threats), and observable behavioral changes (e.g., disability, excessive use of the health care system) [22]. The report of pain and pain behavior is influenced and maintained by a host of factors including nociception, dysfunction, mood states (e.g., depression, anxiety, disappointment), cultural conditioning, expectations, social contingencies, and secondary gains (e.g., spouse attention, job happiness, relationships with coworkers, litigation, pain medication, control over family and physicians) [22,23]. Thus the target of intervention is not only the source of nociception (if at all identifiable) but also suffering, dysfunction, psychosocial factors, and the dependence on the health care system. Consequently, in the present context, the central question is: Should opioids be used to treat all of these factors [24]? There is little doubt that opioids can inhibit nociception, but should depression, anxiety, or job unhappiness be treated with opiates? Will opioids solve litigation and compensation issues? Will they improve relationships with coworkers or decrease dependence on the health care system? It seems likely that they may achieve the opposite, e.g., an increased dependence on health care services since analgesics can function as a reinforcer of pain behavior and drug intake [25-28]. Thus, the vicious cycle is not broken but instead maintained. Conclusions Clearly, the treatment goals in chronic nonmalignant pain are a reduction of symptoms, suffering and environmental reinforcers of pain behavior, as well as functional improvement, a decreased dependence on the health care system, and the return to work. Analgesics are only part of this treatment. The usual approach is multimodal and includes graduated exercise programs, the encouragement of activity, and cognitive, behavioral and/or supportive measures to provide functional restoration despite continuing pain [29,30]. A powerful drug may encourage passivity and make patients less compliant with their entire treatment program [20]. There is a need for prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the long-term administration of opioids and their effects on all of the above factors. Future studies should demonstrate positive outcomes, not only in terms of pain reports, but also in terms of reduced suffering, depression, functional improvement, reemployment, and decreased use of the health care system. Finally, while case reports have suggested that there may be a subpopulation of patients who may benefit from opioids, future studies need to clearly identify groups of patients that are suitable for this form of therapy. Before more randomized and controlled studies begin to appear in the peer-reviewed literature, the efficacy of opioids in chronic nonmalignant pain remains scientifically unproven.",

      "title": "Consequences of Antipsychotic Medications on Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Individuals suffering from mental illnesses, unfortunately, have a shorter lifespan. An increase in mortality rates is primarily due to physical illness, unhealthy lifestyle, and associated comorbidities. Antipsychotic medications, previously known as tranquilizers, antipsychotics, or neuroleptics, can alleviate or attenuate symptoms related to psychosis, delusion, and/or hallucinations and are used in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or Alzheimer's disease. Within hours to days, these medications alleviate symptoms and reduce confusion in individuals with psychosis; however, the full effect may take longer than usual in some cases. Importantly, these drugs do not cure the disease, but only treat the symptoms of the disease. The treatment is adjusted to reduce any psychotic symptoms while keeping the adverse effects to a minimum level. Antipsychotics may lead to increased risk of diseases, including but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory disorders. Improved dosages, polypharmacy, and age-specific treatment play an important role in limiting the comorbidities, as well as the side effects. Further research and clinical attention are required to understand the functioning of these medications. The review focuses on the use of antipsychotic medications in different diseases and their effect on mental health.",

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

This book provides the latest up-to-date clinical and research information regarding when and how to reduce or to withdraw from psychiatric medication. The book is divided into two parts. While <xref>Part I</xref> deals with the reasons to consider drug withdrawal or dose reduction. <xref>Part II</xref> discusses the withdrawal process. Although this book focuses on medication reduction and withdrawal, the person-centered collaborative approach is also a model for helping children, dependent adults, adults who are emotionally or cognitively impaired, and the elderly, as well as those going through psychiatric medication withdrawal. The book begins with reviews of adverse drug effects that may require drug reduction or withdrawal. It then discusses withdrawal effects for specific drugs to familiarize clinicians, patients, and families with these problems. Reasons for withdrawal for antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs, antidepressant drugs, stimulant drugs, sedatives and opiates, and lithium and mood stabilizers are described. Medication spellbinding (intoxication anosognosia) is caused by all psychoactive substances, and can lead to dangerous behaviors that are highly uncharacteristic of the individual. Prescribers and therapists who embrace a person-centered collaborative approach to therapy and to medication withdrawal will find it professionally gratifying and will help many patients and their families.",

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "abstract": "The major concepts presented in this review can be summarized as follows: 1. There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

However, the presence of interpersonal and social problems, other psychiatric or physical disorders, and the type of depression (e.g. depression as one \"pole' in a bipolar disorder, dysthymia) are also factors of importance. The aim of maintenance treatment (i.e., continued treatment after the patient's recovery) is to prevent recurrence of the depressive episode, whereas the purpose of preventive treatment is to impede the occurrence of new depressive episodes.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

Up to half of all cigarettes are consumed by a minority of the population: persons with schizophrenia and other forms of mental illness. Ironically, despite nicotine dependence being considered a serious and deadly form of addiction in the general population, research on smoking in mental illness is predominantly guided by the idea that smoking has beneficial medication-like treatment effects. This article considers pitfalls of adherence to the self-medication hypothesis as an exclusively held dogma. New evidence from animal modeling work suggests the need to broaden hypothesis-driven research on smoking in mental illness. Adolescent smoking could predispose to mental illness and/or increased nicotine dependence in schizophrenia may represent an involuntary, general addiction vulnerability that has little to do with the 'helpful' psychoactive effects of nicotine or other drugs.",

The frequency and severity of the psychological disturbances are difficult to determine because many factors confound the interpretation of evidence whether it results from open case reports, controlled clinical trials, or neuropsychological testing. Concern about potential problems should not preclude trying an AED if other properties make the agent otherwise appropriate because the occurrence of adverse effects is often unpredictable in any given individual. Impairment can be minimized by gradual titration of dose and limiting total dose as clinically possible. If psychological problems arise and fine titration of the AED cannot eliminate the problem, the drug can be discontinued without permanent life threatening sequellae.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

      "title": "THE FIRST TRIP",
      "abstract": "In this paper, it is suggested that the first use of hallucinogenic drugs often occurs during a life crisis which requires a more autonomous level of functioning. On the one hand, the person wishes to be more self-sufficient; on the other, he wishes to regress to a more dependent state. By taking the drug, he unconsciously hopes it will resolve this dilemma by making him unable to cope without making him feel ashamed of his incapacity. Three case histories are presented to illustrate this type of response. Drug use may also be due to the opposite wish—to become more powerful and able to cope with a crisis. Such unconscious coping mechanisms may often determine the first use of drugs and may also explain why many people are only occasional users. Habitual drug use may occur if concomitant feelings of depression and alienation are relieved, or if pleasure or insight are experienced. Since the psychodynamic determinants of drug use vary for different groups and individuals, it is probably useful and necessary to delineate them in greater detail so as to gain a better understanding of a multicausal phenomenon.",

Prevention should be the priority strategy for dealing with abuse. The most common psychoactive substances in abuse are: alcohol, nicotine, hemp, cocaine, heroin, medicinal drugs. Information about psychoactive substances prohibited for circulation in the state is aggressively disseminated through mass media, the Internet, films, and computer games. Abuse of psychoactive substances affects the quality of life and health, has negative physical, physiological, and psychological consequences. Forensic and pharmaceutical, criminal and legal studies indicate that the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, under the procedural guidance of prosecutors of all levels, take operative and investigative measures and investigative actions. In the structure of polydrug addiction, the syndrome of dependence due to the use of alcohol, which develops after multiple simultaneous use of psychoactive alcohol-containing liquids, alcoholic beverages (beer, vodka, wine), psychoactive alcohol drugs, prevails. Comorbid disorders associated with polydrug addiction were systematized. Estimated that 51.6% are mental illnesses. The results of an interdisciplinary forensic and pharmaceutical, organizational and legal, clinical and pharmacological study indicate the need for further multi-stage pharmacotherapy of polydrug addiction and related comorbid disorders during drug circulation.",

      "abstract": "Various factors contribute to a predisposition towards the excessive consumption of alcohol: socio-demographic factors, a disturbed family background or certain neurological disorders in childhood, a family background of heavy drinking or total abstinence, or a genetic predisposition towards the biochemical reactions of excessive drinking. Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines are generally well tolerated (compared to barbiturates or antidepressants, their side-effects are milder). They may be used safely, their toxicity is low. Benzodiazepine overdosage may be lethal only if the drug is taken simultaneously with other drugs or alcohol. They act primarily through inhibiting the GABA system, their anxiolytic and sedative effects are of primary importance from the psychiatric aspect. Their classification is based on the difference in their receptor affinity (potency) and kinetics. Derivatives of low, medium and high potency are known. The introduction of high potency benzodiazepines in psychiatry has increased the therapeutic means. The major field of indication of benzodiazepine therapy is DSM-III anxiety disorders and insomnias but they may be successfully used in the treatment of manic conditions, schizophrenia, delirium tremens, clinical conditions accompanied by anxiety-depression, acute restlessness, neuroleptic-induced acute distonias, and akathisias. Even if therapeutic doses are used, tolerance to benzodiazepines may develop after some weeks of therapy. The general withdrawal symptoms are not severe, but the rebound symptoms often hinder the discontinuance of the drug or the reduction of doses. When prescribing benzodiazepines the risk of long-term therapy and the prevention of the development of drug addiction have to be considered.",

Clinical features of schizophrenia frequently arise during late adolescence or early adulthood, which places this disease as the most chronic of the psychotic disorders and as one of the leading causes of disability and premature mortality (1). Increasing evidence suggests that cognitive impairment is at the core of schizophrenia and precedes the manifestation of psychosis (2). Furthermore, no pharmacological treatment is currently available for cognitive deficits, which are among the most debilitating symptoms of the disorder. The identification of novel treatments to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia thus seems crucial to improve the quality of life in these patients.",

      "title": "What Are Realistic Treatment Goals? Lingering Symptoms Require You to Evaluate Pharmacotherapy and Offer Psychosocial Interventions",
      "abstract": "The course of chronic psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, differs from chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. Some patients with chronic psychiatric conditions achieve remission and become symptom-free, while others continue to have lingering signs of disease for life. Residual symptoms of schizophrenia are not fully defined in the literature, which poses a challenge because they are central in the overall treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. (1) During this phase of schizophrenia, patients continue to have symptoms after psychosis has subsided. These patients might continue to have negative symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and low energy. Although frank psychotic behavior has disappeared, the patient might continue to hold strange beliefs. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment option for psychiatric conditions, but the psychosocial aspect may have greater importance when treating residual symptoms and patients with chronic psychiatric illness. (2) A naturalistic study in Germany evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (3) The authors used a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale symptom severity score >1 for those purposes, which is possibly a stringent criterion to define residual symptoms. This multicenter study enrolled 399 individuals age 18 to 65 with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. (3) Of the 236 patients achieving remission at discharge, 94% had at least 1 residual symptom and 69% had at least 4 residual symptoms. Therefore, residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted patients. The most frequent residual symptoms were: * blunted affect * conceptual disorganization * passive or apathetic social withdrawal * emotional withdrawal * lack of judgment and insight * poor attention * somatic concern * difficulty with abstract thinking * anxiety * poor rapport. (3) Of note, positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinatory behavior, were found in remitted patients at discharge (17% and 10%, respectively). The study concluded that the severity of residual symptoms was associated with relapse risk and had an overall negative impact on the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. (3) The study noted that residual symptoms may be greater in number or volume than negative symptoms and questioned the origins of residual symptoms because most were present at baseline in more than two-third of patients. Patients with residual symptoms of schizophrenia usually are older and therefore present specific management challenges for clinicians. Changes associated with aging, such as medical problems, cognitive deficits, and lack of social support, could create new care needs for this patient population. Although the biopsychosocial model used to treat chronic psychiatric conditions, especially schizophrenia, is preferred, older schizophrenia patients with residual symptoms often need more psychosocial interventions compared with young adults with schizophrenia. Managing residual symptoms in schizophrenia Few studies are devoted to pharmacological treatment of older adults with schizophrenia, likely because pharmacotherapy for older patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. Evidence-based treatment is based primarily on findings from younger patients who survived into later life. Clinicians often use the adage of geriatric psychiatry, start low, go slow, because older patients are susceptible to adverse effects associated with psychiatric medications, including cardiovascular, metabolic, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects, orthostasis, sedation, falls, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Older patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and anticholinergic adverse effects, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. …",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction; it is a predictable consequence of excess serotonergic activity at central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral serotonin receptors [1]. for this reason, some experts strongly prefer the terms serotonin toxicity or serotonin toxidrome because these more accurately reflect the fact that it is a form of poisoning. It may also be called serotonin sickness, serotonin storm, serotonin poisoning, hyperserotonemia, or serotonergic syndrome [2, 3]. The excess serotonin activity produces a spectrum of specific symptoms including cognitive, autonomic, and somatic effects. The symptoms may range from barely perceptible to fatal. [1]Numerous drugs and drug combinations have been reported to produce serotonin syndrome. Diagnosis of serotonin syndrome includes observing the symptoms produced and a thorough investigation of the patient’s history. The syndrome has a characteristic picture but can be mistaken for other illnesses in some patients, particularly those with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. No laboratory tests can currently confirm the diagnosis [3].",

      "abstract": "Despite many case reports and surveys of practitioners, there is no evidence that specific negative consequences result from the application of hypnosis or the experience of the hypnotic state, per se. Hypnosis inappropriately or ineptly applied, with suggestions that do not take into account the subject's psychological state or vulnerabilities, can result in short and long term deleterious effects. These adverse effects result more from a lack of psychological understanding of the practitioner and the particular vulnerabilities of the patient rather than being dangers of the hypnotic state or process. A lack of appropriate therapist training in hypnosis and hypnotically- based therapy, inadequate understanding of the subject or patient and the pathological psychological processes, and the processes of psychotherapy and the hypnotic process itself, increases the risk of adverse effects.",

The schizophrenia clinical picture is usually misunderstood by the general public and consists of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized speech or behavior during a specific amount of time. In order to establish an accurate diagnosis, it requires taking into consideration both international classification systems, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and The International Classification of diseases (ICD-10), adding a fresh perspective to the newest chapter of ICD-11 called “Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders”, alongside with the diagnosis criteria, other new symptoms such as cognitive impairment emerge as an important feature of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

Although not frequently reported, they might significantly affect the lives of people with SUD. For instance, chorea, tics, and stereotypies are hyperkinetic movements reported in people taking amphetamines. Symptoms usually manifest within the first hours of drug use, subsiding thereafter. In some patients, however, movement disorders can have a chronic course, persisting even after the end of amphetamine misuse. This chapter reports the diversity of movement disorders in SUD and their clinical implications, focusing on the manifestations outside the intoxication phase.",

In this review, the authors attempt to determine whether there is enough evidence in the literature to support the notion that illicit drug use can cause chronic psychotic disorders. They conclude the literature strongly suggests that a number of drugs of abuse in different classes (psychostimulants, hallucinogens, marijuana, and possibly industrial inhalants) can cause or increase the susceptibility for a state of chronic psychosis. It is also likely that the abuse of combinations of these drugs is capable of inducing similar syndromes.",

      "title": "A practical approach to benzodiazepine discontinuation",
      "abstract": "Non-medical use of benzodiazepines is rare among patients with anxiety disorders. Numerous studies have found that non-medical use, or abuse, of benzodiazepines occurs usually among patients with histories of alcohol and drug abuse--those who use those drugs to get \"high\". This article distinguishes between medical and non-medical use of benzodiazepines in clinical practice, and offers practical approaches to discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment for both medical and non-medical users of those medicines. The major barrier to clear thinking about the abuse of benzodiazepines is the confusion of \"addiction\" and \"withdrawal\". Addiction means high, unstable dosing outside medical and social boundaries for \"recreational\" purposes, loss of control over use, and continued use despite clear evidence of harm. Alcoholism and heroin addiction are typical examples of addiction (Kalant, 1989). In contrast, withdrawal is a pharmacological consequence of discontinuation of a substance on which a person has become dependent. Many drug-addicted people have only minor withdrawal symptoms when they stop drug use. Many medical patients, with no evidence of addiction, have withdrawal symptoms when they stop treatment, especially when they stop abruptly (e.g. surgical patients using narcotic analgesics and epileptics using benzodiazepines or barbiturates in their treatment). Addiction to benzodiazepines, in the sense of loss of control over use and continued despite harm, is virtually limited to people with pre-existing drug or alcohol abuse, while withdrawal symptoms after prolonged daily use are common among medical users of benzodiazepines. The serious nature of both drug abuse and anxiety disorders is not emphasized sufficiently during medical school or in the professional literature. The distress and disability from which both groups of patients and their families suffer is profound. Fortunately, both drug abuse and anxiety patients receive tremendous benefit from successful treatments, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological (DuPont, 1986a; DuPont, 1984). This article discusses the use of benzodiazepines in two distinct populations--drug abusers and patients with anxiety disorders--and helps clinicians distinguish between the use of benzodiazepines in the two groups. The central distinction made in this article is reflected in the common use of the words \"drugs\" and \"medicines\". The former term often denotes non-medical substance use, while the latter term refers to traditional pharmacotherapy.",

However, even violence did not distinguish those discharged with a diagnosis of conduct disorder from those whose diagnoses were subsequently changed.

We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.",

In those early years only hypnotics and anticonvulsants were available and they were administered chiefly for the management of excitement and agitation. The discovery of chlorpromazine (Delay & Deniker, 1952) and other neuroleptics resulted in a revolution in the treatment of psychoses of adults. It was hoped that these drugs would arrest or decrease the psychotic process in the child and that after the reduction of anxiety, hyperactivity, and/or aggressiveness he would become more amenable to special education and other treatment modalities. These hopes were not always fulfilled. Drug therapy has come under attack because of improper use, especially with institutionalized retarded Children. This abuse has included high dosage over prolonged periods of time, multiple drug usage—children receiving from two to eight drugs at the same time—no drug holidays, little or no evidence of drug monitoring, and usage of sedative types of phenothiazines which probably suppress cognitive learning functions (Lipman, 1970).",

In addition to physical symptoms related to nervous system hyperexcitability, withdrawal includes changes in mental state that may motivate renewed AOD consumption. The manifestations of addiction are associated with changes in nerve cell function by which the brain attempts to adapt to a drug's presence. These functional changes modulate a person's initial response to a drug, the establishment of long-term craving for the drug (i.e., addiction), and the persistent sense of discomfort that leads to relapse after abstinence has been achieved. Research is beginning to reveal how specific brain regions may be integrated to form neural circuits that modulate aspects of addiction.",

      "abstract": "Elderly individuals have a different profile of dysfunction of the special senses than younger individuals, due in part to a constellation of physiologic aging-related changes in the individual sensory systems, the frequent occurrence of multiple comorbid disease states, and a greater likelihood of toxic effects of medications. Regardless of sensory modality, disorders of the special senses in the elderly can be conveniently divided into conductive, sensorineural, and central disorders. Disorders of the chemosensory senses, smell and taste, are usually less disabling than disorders of the other special senses (vision and hearing). Nevertheless, olfactory impairment is a significant contributor to perceived disability and lower quality of life among elderly patients and is a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Gustatory disorders in the elderly that are not secondary to olfactory disorders should prompt consideration of systemic factors, such as medication use, toxin exposures and autoimmune disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive substances are believed to be aphrodisiac; but in reality they have deleterious effects on all the aspects of sexual function. The purpose of this article is to review and summarize the available scientific literature on the impact of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs on erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. Almost all of them have been reported to be associated with ED. These substances may exert their inhibitory effect on erection through their effects on central neurotransmitter pathways (serotogenic, adrenergic or dopaminergic). Besides, some also may exhibit vasoconstricting properties (cocaine), impair endothelium function (nicotine) or suppress the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary, resulting in hypogonadism (morphine) to induce ED. The relationship between ED and psychoactive substances is attributed not only to pharmacological effects, but also to psychological and social reactions to substance dependence. Whether withdrawal from the substances could restore erectile function remains unknown. However, human and animal studies demonstrated that the effects of neurological damage from chronic substance abuse are long-lasting. This information of sexual consequence of the substances will be of great general interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

There are several terms describing the level to which the consciousness is decreased. Lethargy is the state of slightly reduced alertness and extreme fatigue. The term somnolence describes a drowsy patient who responds to mild stimulus (such as voice), and mumbles incoherently and moves in a disorganized fashion. In contrast, a stuporous patient responds to a vigorous and continuous stimulus only, and upon discontinuation of a stimulus returns to an unresponsive state. Coma is a state of complete unresponsiveness, from which a patient cannot be aroused.",

Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

While frequently described as separate entities, these two syndromes are mutually characterized by indifference and may be united under the single moniker, \"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced indifference.\" Little is known about the epidemiology or etiology of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced indifference and few empirical studies have been undertaken. However, this syndrome may be under-recognized by both clinicians and patients (i.e., low insight, particularly among children and adolescents), and is characterized by an insidious onset, dose-dependent effects (i.e., higher selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor doses are more likely to result in symptoms), and complete resolution of symptoms with the discontinuation of the offending drug. Treatment strategies may include a dose reduction of the offending selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, augmentation with a second drug, and/or discontinuation of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and subsequent treatment with a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant.",

Age related physiological changes which influence drug concentrations, metabolism, polypharmacy and interaction of other drugs with alcohol can negatively influence functional capacity, psychomotor ability, and cognition, including attention and memory, placing the older person at greater risk of accident, injury, isolation and ultimately institutionalisation. It is argued that DSM-IV criteria used to define \"abuse\" or \"dependence\" are of limited value to the majority of elderly 'problem' alcohol or drug users, with ICD-10 criteria that identify those who are experiencing 'a risk' of or where use \"is actually\" causing \"early\" harm, more appropriate. Impediments to psychiatrists and other medical practitioners identifying 'problem' alcohol and other drug use, and appropriate assessment and intervention procedures are briefly discussed. The potential for decreasing the incidence and severity of physical and psycho/social events following a reduction or cessation in problem alcohol or other drug use means that assessment and intervention should be one cornerstone of management practice for this often disenfranchised and vulnerable group.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

The effects which lead to sexual dysfunction are mostly reported by patients which are themselves reluctant to discuss with their physician. Antihistaminics, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and minor tranquilizer may have an adverse effect on sexual function. Because elderly people are prone to adverse drug effects, they arc expected to experience more side effects on their sexual life with commonly prescribed drugs than younger ones are to.

      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement. The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems. Individual differences in the neurobiological systems that underlie the processing of reward, incentive salience, habits, stress, pain, and executive function may explain (i) the vulnerability to substance-use disorder; (ii) the diversity of emotional, motivational, and cognitive profiles of individuals with substance-use disorders; and (iii) heterogeneous responses to cognitive and pharmacological treatments. Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.",

Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage [2]. Pain is described as acute or chronic. Acute pain is experienced for short time (two weeks) due to trauma while chronic pain last longer than three months and is associated with injury to tissues or nerves. There are four factors that commonly affect pain expressions: Location, Duration, Intensity and Etiology. The location is the place where the pain occurs. Duration is the time that pain lasts, and is classified as chronic or acute. Intensity tells how severe the pain is. It is usually measured through a pain scale from zero to ten. The patient's rate themselves. Usually, four to six is considered as a moderate level, and above seven is considered to be severe pain [3].",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractBackground: Hypomania or mania have rarely been reported to develop shortly after the discontinuation of an antidepressant drug. The true incidence of this discontinuation syndrome is unknown because it may be underreported as a consequence of underrecognition or misattribution. This article examines the possible etiology, nosology, mechanisms, and other aspects of the syndrome. Data Sources and Study Selection: A PubMed search was conducted in May 2003 and repeated in January 2004 using the search terms antidepressant and mania. Relevant articles containing adequate descriptions for presentation were retrieved, and their reference lists were hand-searched for further pertinent material. Hand-searches of the indexes of leading psychiatry journals were also performed for the years 1998-2003. Twenty-three articles were identified for review. Conclusions: Antidepressant-withdrawal hypomania or mania may occur rarely with almost any antidepressant drug after sudden withdrawal, tapered discontinuation, or even merely a decrease in dose. The syndrome may be self-limiting, may abate with the reinstitution of the antidepressant drug, or may require specific antimanic treatments; mood stabilizers do not necessarily protect against the syndrome. The true incidence of the syndrome is unknown. Narrow and broad diagnostic criteria are proposed for the syndrome, and a synthesis of literature is provided.",

      "title": "Clinical and Pathophysiological Aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

      "title": "Neuroleptic reduction and/or cessation and neuroleptics as specific treatments for tardive dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Since the 1950s neuroleptic medication has been extensively used to treat people with chronic mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. These drugs, however, have been also associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD). Various strategies have been examined to reduce a person's cumulative exposure to neuroleptics. These studies include dose reduction, intermittent dosing strategies, such as drug holidays, and neuroleptic cessation.To determine whether, for those people with both schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) and tardive dyskinesia (TD), a reduction or cessation of neuroleptic drugs was associated with reduction in TD symptoms. A secondary objective was to determine whether the use of specific neuroleptics for similar groups of people could be a treatment for already established TD.Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982-1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials (1997), EMBASE (1980-1997), LILACS (1982-1996), MEDLINE (1966-1997), PsycLIT (1974-1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were undertaken. References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Principal authors of trials were contacted.Reports were included if they assessed the treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses and already established TD, who had been randomly allocated to (a) neuroleptic cessation (placebo or no intervention) versus neuroleptic maintenance; b. neuroleptic reduction (including intermittent strategies) versus neuroleptic maintenance; or c. specific neuroleptics for the treatment of TD versus placebo or no intervention.The reviewers extracted the data independently and the Odds Ratio (95% CI) or the average difference (95% CI) were estimated. The reviewers assumed that people who dropped out had no improvement.Two trials were able to be included in this review. Sixty two were excluded and 16 are awaiting assessment. Seven trials are still pending classification. No randomised controlled trial-derived data were available to clarify the role of neuroleptics as treatments for TD. This includes the atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Despite neuroleptic cessation being a frequently first-line recommendation, there were no RCT-derived data to support this. Two studies ( approximately approximately Cookson 1987 approximately approximately , approximately approximately Kane 1983 approximately approximately ) found a reduction in TD associated with neuroleptic reduction.The lack of evidence to support the efficacy of neuroleptic cessation as a treatment for TD, combined with the accumulating evidence of an increased risk of relapse should antipsychotic drugs be reduced, makes this intervention a hazardous treatment for TD. Dose reduction may offer some benefit as a treatment for TD compared to standard levels of neuroleptic use. There is a need to evaluate the utility of clozapine and the 'atypical' antipsychotics as treatments for established TD.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a conspicuous problem in modern 24 h society. In this brief overview, medications used to treat insomnia such as hypnotics, sedatives, medications inducing sedation as a side effect, medications directed at the sleep-associated circadian neuroendocrine system, and agents utilized in treating insomnia-inducing sleep diagnoses such as restless leg syndrome are discussed. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia with the majority of evidence supporting treatment efficacy for cognitive-behavioral therapy and short acting GABA-receptor agonists. In patients with comorbid insomnia the use of hypnotics can improve outcomes and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the use of more toxic medications. Except in individuals whose insomnia is secondary to circadian disturbance, mood disorder/depression and/or restless leg syndrome , there is minimal evidence supporting the efficacy of other medications used to treat insomnia despite their widespread use. Sedatives and other medications used off-label for sedative side-effects are a contributing factor to drug induced hypersomnolence, a factor in more than 30% of motor accident deaths. Hypnotic medications with low toxicity, addictive potential, minimal next day sleepiness, and an otherwise benign side-effect profile can be utilized safely and effectively to treat and improve function and quality of life for patients suffering from insomnia. These are the agents that should be exclusively classified as hypnotics and utilized to induce sleep when medications are required to treat the complaint of insomnia. Other pharmacological agents producing sedation (sedatives and agents used off-label for sedative side-effects) should be used cautiously for the treatment of insomnia due to the increased risk of next day sleepiness as well as for known toxicities and adverse side effects.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is so frequently repeated or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting condition. Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

      "abstract": "The fact that general practitioner (GP) or psychiatrist understands the psychosocial effects of prescribing on the doctor-patient relationship is as important, if not more so, than knowing pharmacology. Any prescription of drugs modifies the doctor-patient relationship. Drugs, especially psychotropic drugs, act on symptoms and change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; they can create both physical and psychological dependency; they can discourage a deep search for real solutions, both on the part of the doctor and the patient; they can affect the doctor’s access to the patient and the problem will be out of their reach. Psychotropic drugs can make the effect of the doctor in himself as a drug more difficult, favor an insignificant or problematic or little human relational context, where the GP/psychiatrist does not delve into the true meaning of the symptoms, and the patient tends not to get involved, to make an emotional withdrawal, to be passive before the prescribed drug, and can result in the chronification and structuring of functional symptoms that become organic, with lack of cooperation of the doctor and the patient, and paradoxically with over-compliance or therapeutic discontinuity and the lack of pharmacological adherence, absences to appointments or delays or cancellations of visits, and the denial of responsibility of both the doctor and the patient.",

      "title": "Vataja Unmada: Schizophrenia or Dementia or Mood Disorder with Psychosis?",
      "abstract": "Unmada (a broad term which includes different psychiatric conditions under one umbrella) is characterized by the derangement of manas (mind), buddhi (cognitive functions), samgna gnana (orientation), smriti (memory), bhakti (interests), sheela (character/personality), cheshtha (psychomotor activity/behavior), and achara (conduct). Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

The commonest substances used are alcohol and tobacco, followed by cannabis, sedative-hypnotic drugs, opioids, psychostimulants and hallucinogens, roughly in that order. Most drugs that are misused have the potential to induce dependence. Many have intrinsic tissue toxicity and give rise to a range of physical and neuropsychiatric complications. Illicit drug use may be complicated by adverse effects of adulterants, and the intravenous route may act as the means of transmission of viral, bacterial and other communicable diseases.

      "title": "Young and exhausted",
      "abstract": "To the Editor,Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, multisystem and often debilitating disorder of unknown etiology. (1) It is a complicated disease characterized by at least six months (in pediatrics 3 months) of extreme fatigue that is not alleviated by rest and a group of other symptoms that are constant for a period of time. (1)Post-exertional malaise (PEM) and delayed recovery are core symptoms and the most useful when making a diagnosis. (2) PEM involves a constellation of substantially disabling signs and symptoms that occur in response to physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual over-exertion. (2) The diagnosis of CFS/ME relies on the typical clinical presentation and the exclusion of other causes of fatigue. Up until now there was no test to confirm the diagnosis of CFS/ME. The two-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is becoming a new diagnostic method that can be used in case of suspicion of CFS/ME in attempt to evaluate presence of PEM. (4) This test, used in centres for patients with CFS/ME, has not yet published any data in pediatrics to support its use.We present a case of a 13-year-old patient with chronic debilitating fatigue who meets the criteria for CFS/ME. The patient was examined in detail by a pediatrician (anamnestic unclear cause, resting tachycardia in the physical examination, laboratory tests within normal limits), endocrinologist (normal hormonal profile for a given age, Tanner stage 3), infectologist (serology for typical viruses negative), psychologist (normal cognitive functions). For a history of resting tachycardia, the patient was examined by a cardiologist where no cardiogenic cause of fatigue was demonstrated, sinus tachycardia was present, and the patient was recommended head-up-tilt test, which showed the presence of postural orthostatic tachycardia. Due to the idiopathic nature of the difficulties and the excluded secondary cause, a two-day protocol examination by cardiopulmonary exercise testing was indicated. Written consent was taken and documented. Before the examination, we performed resting spirometry (physiological findings), resting ECG (sinus tachycardia) and a shortened Schellong test with a tachycardic response to orthostasis immediately after standing up and after 3 minutes of standing. Subsequently, standard CPET using treadmill (Itam, Poland) with individualized protocol with progressive increase in workload until exhaustion and breath-by-breath analysis of exhaled gases (Geratherm, Germany) was performed. On the first day, basal values were determined, the patient subjectively tolerated the examination well, the exercise ended prematurely due to subjective fatigue and a feeling of lack of air. On the second day, under the same conditions, the CPET was repeated, during which the patient also terminated the exercise prematurely but a half minute later than on the first day (exercise duration 6:32 min vs. 7:00 min; peak work rate 3,26W/kg vs. 3,68W/kg; peak VO2 34,5 ml/kg/min vs. 36,5 ml/kg/min). Using this methodology, patient did not meet diagnostic criteria for PEM and subsequently CFS/ME (decrease in monitored values on the second day of the examinations). In both days, during exercise, a bizarre pattern of respiration with malposition of the respiratory act to the large airways was observed by observing the flow-volume loop. Analysis of the respiratory pattern identified an erratic respiratory pattern (figure 1A) with low resting ETCO2 (26mmHg) and tachypnoea at maximal workload with dominant ventilation of dead space (figure 1B, 1C, 1G). The consequence of this pattern of respiration is a chronic state of hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis, which is metabolically compensated in the patient. Fatigue and increased heart rate are expected clinical manifestations. Respiratory rehabilitation was recommended to the patient in order to fixate the correct breathing patterns (diaphragmatic breathing) and psychological guidance. The patient was subsequently retested 3 months after the start of physiotherapy and psychotherapy at the request of the parents. Retesting showed significant improvements in the monitored parameters (figure 1G) as well as in the clinical condition of the patient. The patient’s overall fitness increased, an adequate resting respiratory pattern was present (figure 1D), normal resting ETCO2 (36mmHg), ventilatory efficiency was adjusted (figure 1F, 1G), and the patient reported a subjective increase in energy. Prior to the examination, we performed a Schellong test on the patient, in which there were no signs of postural orthostatic tachycardia.Dysfunctional breathing (DB) is a condition of the airways characterized by an irregular breathing pattern and changes in the airways that cannot be attributed to a specific diagnosis and that causes respiratory and non-respiratory problems. (3) It is not a disease process, but rather changes in respiratory patterns that disrupt normal respiratory processes. However, DB can coexist with diseases such as bronchial asthma or heart disease. The main symptom is shortness of breath or air hunger, associated with non-respiratory symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, cervical spine pain or fatigue. (5) It also plays a role in chronic fatigue, neck and back pain, fibromyalgia, and some aspects of anxiety and depression. (5)The most common type of DB is hyperventilation syndrome, which is defined as respiration exceeding metabolic requirements, reducing blood carbon dioxide concentrations below normal values. (3) This changes the pH of the blood, increases the alkalinity and thus triggers a number of adaptive changes that cause symptoms. These conditions are non-somatic in nature and their treatment consists of respiratory rehabilitation by various techniques (diaphragmatic breathing, Feldenkrais method, Buteyko method, Pilates) and psychotherapy in order to control impulsive changes in the respiratory pattern in various situations. (5)CPET confirmed the presence of DB in the patient based on the low resting value of ETCO2, the presence of a chaotic pattern of respiration during resting and exercise with the presence of tachypnoea (with very low ventilatory efficiency) in maximal exertion. Diagnosis of DB using CPET is one of the methods of DB diagnostics. Proper respiratory rehabilitation and psychological guidance resulted in the patient fixing the respiratory pattern and subsequently eliminating the primary cause of the examination - chronic fatigue. Patients with CFS/ME are a common pediatric problem. The current possibilities of diagnostics are enriched by the possibility of performing CPET which can be a benefit in differential diagnostics as well as in confirming the diagnosis.",

We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs. A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.",

      "title": "SP0019 Signs, symptoms and co-morbidities of fibromyalgia",
      "abstract": "In the beta browser version of ICD11, fibromyalgia is listed as a chronic primary pain syndrome (Treede et al. 2015). It is categorized as chronic widespread pain, and is distinguished from other chronic widespread pain by a) tender point counts (American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria), or b) psychosocial distress (ACR 2010). Both ACR definitions are problematic for research purposes: mechanisms of tender points are poorly understood, and using distress as inclusion criterion may lead to circular arguments. Chronic primary pain is characterized by significant emotional distress and functional disability. It is multifactorial: biological, psychological and social factors contribute to the pain syndrome. The diagnosis is appropriate independently of identified biological or psychological contributors unless another diagnosis would better account for the presenting symptoms. Chronic Primary Pain can occur in any body site (face, low back, neck, upper limb, thorax, abdominal, pelvis, urogenital region), or in a combination of body sites (Widespread pain). In general, multiple sites of pain are associated with higher distress and disability than single sites. Chronic Primary Pain is also often associated with sleep disturbance, adverse side effects of treatments (such as medication dependence), and comorbidities (such as depression, anxiety, anger, guilt, fear, and a range of chronic medical conditions). As part of the research consortium LOGIN we have compared the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia, other chronic widespread pain and chronic localized pain in the lower back. In those datasets, fibromyalgia patients showed higher comorbidity of anxiety and depression and more functional impairment than the other groups (Gerhardt et al. 2016). A deficit in conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was related to the spatial spread of ongoing pain, consistent with the neurobiology of endogenous pain control systems. FMS differed from CWP with respect to psychosocial burden, consistent with the shift in clinical diagnostic criteria. Tender point counts (an evoked pain measure) were still useful to identify the FMS patients (Gerhardt et al. 2017). A study using the childhood trauma questionnaire suggests that early stress exposure is associated nonspecifically with lowered pressure pain thresholds which may be related to tender points (Tesarz et al. 2016). Experimental sleep deprivation in healthy subjects or rodents leads to symptom profiles reminiscent of fibromyalgia (e.g. widespread hyperalgesia, anxiety), suggesting a potential vicious circle of pain, hyperalgesia and sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia. In summary, fibromyalgia is a chronic primary pain syndrome characterized by widespread pain and major comorbidities. A combination of predisposition plus an initiating painful event seem to play a role in its genesis; according to the dual hit hypothesis, traumatic events during childhood may contribute to the predisposition.

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the conceptual problems in distinguishing between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome, for both may present with fatigue as the main symptom. Recent findings The differences and/or similarities between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome have not been studied, conceptually or empirically. The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

      "abstract": "There are many challenges facing healthcare professionals. One such challenge is the continuous introduction of new synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs pose many difficulties to providers, including identification of the drug ingested, management of symptoms, ensuring safety of the patient and his or her environment, and continual monitoring after the initial symptoms, because synthetic cathinones have many long-term effects on an individual. One such synthetic drug, flakka, is a potent second-generation synthetic cathinone. Because flakka inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are involved in one's perception of pleasure, it causes inflated feelings and also causes signs and symptoms of psychosis. Flakka also induces various exaggerated symptoms, such as feelings of incredible strength, disorientation, aggression, and altered thought processes, and also can cause hyperthermia, coma, and death. Healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of flakka ingestion, the various symptoms a user may exhibit, and the long-term symptoms a person may have once the acute recovery phase has ended. Once the initial phase of ingestion is over and the patient is medically stabilized, the patient may experience signs and symptoms of psychosis or other psychiatric disorders. It is paramount that healthcare professionals are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of flakka ingestion, know the steps to take to ensure safety of the patient and those around him or her, and also know how to facilitate the patient's recovery.",

Certain rare complications of alcoholism, such as degeneration of the cerebellum and the corpus callosum, are not included in this classification, since their relation to the toxic effects of alcohol or to nutritional deficiency has not yet been clarified. Acute intoxication from alcohol results in the familiar symptoms of drunkenness or, if severe in degree, in stupor and coma.

      "title": "Clinical, methodological and theoretical issues in the assessment of cognition after anaesthesia and surgery",
      "abstract": "As people live longer, the burden of cognitive impairment to elderly patients, their families and society becomes increasingly common and important. The loss of independence, a reduction in the quality of life and increased mortality are possible correlates to the mental disintegration. Cognitive dysfunction following major surgery on the elderly is a significant problem which adds to other cognitive impairments caused by neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular impairments and other causes. There are challenges in reviewing the literature because of many methodological concerns. There is no standard definition; the diagnosis is made only by the results of neuropsychological tests which are not standardised for this purpose; test results are analysed by different statistical methods (some of them inappropriate); controls are often absent or poorly matched; and pre-existing mild cognitive impairment, which affects 10 to 20% of people older than 65 years and is similar to the subtle cognitive impairment following surgery, is not sought for and recognised. Reviews of the subject have varied from descriptions such as ‘a well recognised and significant problem’ to ‘a hypothetical phenomenon for which there is no International Statistical Classification of Disease (ICD-9) code, and no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) code’. This article examines both sides of the spectrum in a detailed review which explains the necessary psychological ‘jargon’, discusses the methods used and points to areas of future research.",

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

      "abstract": "1. Preliminary observation would indicate that Tofrānil is a useful drug in the treatment of depressive states. It is not a tranquilizer and, therefore, is of little value in other conditions. It is a promising drug which can be used as an anti-depressant. However, its indication and scope must be studied for a longer period to determine what symptoms respond best to it. 2. The effect of Tofrānil in many patients can be increased by the concomitant use of a tranquilizer or a stimulant. In a number of patients Tofrānil, by removing the depressive elements, frees and exaggerates anxiety. 3. It can be used in combination with electric shock or after electric shock as a maintenance dose. 4. It is of little value in the treatment of schizophrenics and in paranoid types may often aggravate the condition and break down an unstable equilibrium to which the patient has become adjusted. 5. The combined use of Tofrānil and a tranquilizer is helpful in certain psychoneurotic states, associated with anxiety or with reactive depressions. 6. It is of value in the treatment of depressions occurring in the older age group. 7. High doses are unnecessary and the effective range is somewhere between 75 and 150 mgm. per day. 8. For the most part, side effects are minimal, particularly in the younger age group. As one approaches the older age group, the frequency of such side effects increases, but usually they are more uncomfortable than serious. In patients over 60 there may be a tendency to sudden falls which occur without warning. It is recommended that in older patients the dosage be limited to 75 mgm. or less. 9. Side effects can usually be reduced in frequency or intensity by a reduction in the dosage. 10. Long-term use of the drug is apparently necessary as patients may relapse, at least in the early stages when the drug is prematurely removed. Since the drug is rapidly excreted, it is necessary to give the medication 3 times a day.",

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "title": "Considerations on third generation antihistamines",
      "abstract": "For several months now, the term ‘third generation of antihistamines’ has emerged spontaneously from the medical literature. These attempts at definition, which vary greatly, create confusion both for the health professionals and the lay public. This is of considerable concern for the scientific community involved in allergy, mainly due to the lack of consensus. One definition refers to the active metabolites of new second generation drugs as the basis for a third one [1,2]. Others are focused on certain specific properties: no electrocardiogram (ECG) effects [3], rapid onset of action [4] or no drug interactions [3]. First generation antihistamines were defined by their H1 receptor blocking power and despite pronounced unwanted side-effects are still often used mainly in over-the-counter (OTC) products, alone or in combination with other drugs. The second generation antihistamines are said to be ‘non-sedating H1 blockers’ due to the lack of penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Compared to the first generation, they are known for their high potency and minimal central nervous system (CNS) effects. Numerous compounds have been created responding to their own pharmacokinetics. Some of them undergo extensive metabolism, others do not. Cardiotoxic effects emerged with some second generation antihistamines and most of the new compounds exhibit properties on systems other than H1 receptors, i.e. anti-inflammatory properties. Certainly, the second generation manifests a great diversity. Which criteria should drugs have to fulfil to be labelled as third generation antihistamine? This is obviously for the scientific community to answer. To pave the way for the elaboration of a consensual definition and with the support of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, a Consensus Group on New Generation Antihistamines (CONGA) has been set up. This Group is led by Professor S. T. Holgate (UK) and includes Professor G. W. Canonica (Italy), Dr G. Scadding (UK), Professor F. Estelle R. Simons (Canada), Professor M. Tharp (USA), Professor H. Timmerman (the Netherlands) and Professor K. Yanai (Japan), so that there will be a multidisciplinary input. This exercise is closely linked to the Southampton Workshop ‘Antihistamines: Back to the Future’[5] and should appear as a necessary sequel after a 4-year evolution of the antihistamine class. The Consensus Group met for the first time at the University of Leuven (Belgium), June 11–12, 2001, and made clear the necessity to clarify the theme with the help of international experts representing the different fields involved in allergy. Respecting a strictly academic approach, the Consensus Group agreed on the following aims: (a) to review in depth the present status of the term ‘third generation antihistamines’, (b) to analyse the potential criteria that drugs should fulfil to be labelled as third generation, (c) to find gaps and to bridge them with the back-up of expert networking, and (d) to issue a consensual statement endorsed by the scientific community.",

      "abstract": "DRUGS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: TOWARD A THEORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY PAUL WILLNER* Levels ofExplanation ofPsychotropic Drug Effects A few micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can produce a major psychological experience, usually described as an \"altered state of consciousness,\" which can sometimes be the most powerful experience a person has ever had. \"Explanations\" ofthese phenomena usually involve a discussion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) [1, 2]. Clearly, however, a description of biochemical phenomena in no sense explains the LSD experience, since no account is offered of how the biochemical changes give rise to altered states of consciousness. A similar problem arises in relation to biochemical \"theories\" of mental disorder, such as the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia or the catecholamine hypothesis of depression. Paranoid delusions are not explained by demonstrating that DA systems are hyperactive; neither are ideas of suicide explained by a malfunction of noradrenergic (NA) systems . However successful these reductionist hypotheses may be in generating testable hypotheses, leading, for example, to the development of effective pharmacological agents, a hypothesis of brain function which omits any reference to the structure or operating principles ofthe brain is unlikely to be of more than heuristic value. An alternative approach attempts to bridge this conceptual gap by seeking explanations of psychotropic drug effects in four independent explanatory domains: biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and subjective (using die word \"cognitive\" in the information-processing sense in which it is now used in cognitive psychology, rather than as a synonym for \"conscious\"). In terms of a computer analogy, these four domains ?Psychology Department, City of London Polytechnic, Old Castle Street, London El 7NT, England.© 1984 by The University of Chicago. AU rights reserved. 003 1-5982/85/2801-0404$01 .00 Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 28, 1 · Autumn 1984 \\ 49 include two levels of \"hardware\" and two of \"software,\" corresponding very roughly to components, wiring, programming, and editing. Each explanatory domain has its own language and logic, and each must be understood in its own terms. A recent theory of the action of anti-anxiety drugs [3] will serve as an illustration. In this account, which is embedded within the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological theory of anxiety, anxiolytic drugs act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or at other sites (level 1), to disrupt the flow of impulses in neural circuits in the hippocampus and subiculum (level 2). The information carried in these circuits is used to make a comparison between actual and expected events: a mismatch activates a \"behavioural inhibition system,\" which suppresses ongoing motor activity and increases arousal and attention to the environment (level 3); these effects are experienced as anxiety (level 4). Irrespective of its empirical merits [4], the hypothesis has a sound conceptual basis. The analysis spans all four levels ofexplanation, rather than the usual two: physiological (level 2) and cognitive (level 3) levels are interposed between biochemistry (level 1) and subjective experience (level 4). In addition to describing an empirical relationship between receptor interactions and an anti-anxiety effect, die account also specifies the neural pathways implicated, their role in normal cognitive functioning , and the relationship between changes in cognitive function and changes in experience. In describing the psychological effect of a drug or an endogenous biochemical change, it is important to consider not only the intervening levels of explanation but also the nature of the transitions between adjacent levels. The generation of changes in neural firing (level 2) from the biochemical effect of a drug (level 1) depends on the integration of that biochemical effect into a context of other ongoing biochemical processes , which include adaptive regulation resulting from the primary drug effect. The effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs at noradrenergic synapses is a well-worked example: it is now established that, in addition to potentiating neurotransmission by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake, after chronic treatment, tricyclics also decrease neurotransmission by reducing the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-receptors [5]. It is rather less frequendy recognized, however, that the important issue is the net outcome of these and other effects on the traffic of nerve impulses in postsynaptic structures [6, 7]. Similar considerations apply to die transition from physiology (level 2) to cognitive processes (level 3). A good...",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have been specifically devoted to anxiety disorders in the elderly. Nevertheless, various factors can expose this population to relevant levels of anxiety: development of somatic disorders, bereavements, isolation, changes of life, use of anxiogenic drugs, etc. Prevalence rates weaker than in the general population are usually found, but with high rates, however, for generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. The clinical aspect of these anxious states is often dominated by somatic symptoms and complaints, and some topics seem of special concern: fear of death and disease, displacement phobias related to the fear of falling or being attacked. Some consequences should be particularly watched over (diverse somatic affections, depression, dementia, and even suicidal tendencies), which justify an accurate clinical evaluation. Treatment must often be multidisciplinary involving medical but also psychological, and institutional aspects. The therapeutic strategies are largely identical to what they are in the other groups of age. Anxiolytic drugs and antidepressants, cognitive-behavioral therapies can be proposed, even if some adaptation of drug posology or methods of non pharmacological interventions should be needed. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of benzodiazepine dependence, drugs which are widely used by elderly subjects. As a conclusion, anxiety disorders in the elderly present clinical and therapeutic particularities, which require a special approach and the development of specific epidemiological, physiopathologic and therapeutic researches.",

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated in people with co-factors such as depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and bulimia/bingeing. These behavioral or cognitive patterns may be adaptive or neutral in the conditions under which we evolved but maladaptive in environments requiring alertness for extended periods, where a fully mobilized fight-or-flight response is inappropriate, and where food availability makes lack of an \"appestat\" a liability. Such conditions are amenable to management by nicotine because of its ability to produce small but reliable adjustments in relevant cognitive and behavioral functions. Moreover, symptomatology may be unmasked or exacerbated by nicotine abstinence, persisting beyond the usual time-course for nicotine withdrawal, which may explain the particular attraction of smoking and the difficulty these individuals experience in quitting without necessarily requiring that they be more nicotine-dependent. The implications are: (1) a better understanding of the evolutionary psychobiology of smoking may promote development of tailored interventions for smokers with co-factors; (2) nicotine may have therapeutic applications for non-smokers with co-factors; (3) because smoking has a fairly high heritability index, and because of evidence of assortative mating, special prevention efforts targeting children of smokers with co-factors, as well as early identification of the co-factor itself, may be needed.",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL VIOLENCE CONSEQUENCES FOR DIFFERENT AGE CATEGORIES",
      "abstract": "An increase in the number of victims of psycho-violence, which has a traumatic effect on the personality, causing emotional stress, stress, discomfort, and depression, necessitates studying the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

In der Lebenszeit wie auch aktuell sind bis weit über 50% der Opiatabhängigen von komorbiden psychischen Störungen betroffen. Besonders verbreitet sind affektive und Angststörungen, Persönlichkeitsstörungen sowie posttraumatische Belastungsstörungen. Diese Störungen können allenfalls zu einem Teil als Begleit- oder Folgeerscheinung der Opiatabhängigkeit erklärt werden. Vorbestehende psychische Belastungen und frühzeitig manifestierte Störungen können vielmehr oft als wesentliche Faktoren bei der Suchtentstehung angesehen werden, z. B. im Sinne einer Selbstmedikation mit psychotropen Substanzen. Pharmakologische und psychotherapeutische Behandlungsmöglichkeiten der komorbiden psychischen Störungen sind hinsichtlich ihrer Anwendbarkeit und Wirksamkeit bei unbehandelten oder in Behandlung (z. B. Substitution) befindlichen Opiatabhängigen kaum erforscht. Zudem fehlt es an integrierten Modellen und Algorithmen für die Behandlung bei gleichzeitig bestehenden substanzbezogenen und sonstigen psychischen Störungen.",

      "abstract": "To minimize the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation, gradual tapering is necessary for all serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) except fluoxetine, which has an extended half-life. Agents with shorter half-lives such as venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine should be tapered gradually. Discontinuation symptoms, which frequently emerge after abrupt discontinuation or intermittent non-compliance and, less frequently, during dose reduction, are generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting but can be distressing and may lead to missed work days and decreased productivity. The symptoms may be somatic (e.g., dizziness and light-headedness; nausea and vomiting; fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, chills, and other flu-like symptoms; sensory and sleep disturbances) or psychological (anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, irritability). Mild symptoms can often be treated by simply reassuring the patient that they are usually transient, but for more severe symptoms, it may be necessary to reinstitute the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the rate of taper. Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical illness or relapse into depression; misdiagnosing the symptoms may lead to unnecessary, costly tests and treatment. Thus, health care professionals need to be educated about the potential adverse effects of SRI discontinuation.",

      "abstract": "Many patients experience difficulty swallowing pills, for I various reasons: * discomfort (particularly pediatric and geriatric patients) * postsurgical need for an alternate route of enteral intake (nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) * dysphagia due to a neurologic disorder (multiple sclerosis, impaired gag reflex, dementing processes) * odynophagia (pain upon swallowing) due to gastroesophageal reflux or a structural abnormality * a structural abnormality of the head or neck that impairs swallowing. (1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations. Helping patients find a medication formulation that suits their needs strengthens adherence and the therapeutic relationship.

Although their form of clinical presentation may be similar, their evolution and prognosis are very different. It is very important to detect the possible factors of chronicity in order to make an early intervention and thus to diminish the negative consequences of the disease.We conducted a 2 year prospective study in 48 patients diagnosed with acute psychosis in their first admission. Data was collected on the evolution and follow-up of the patient in the Mental Health Unit and the sociodemographic and clinical factors of the psychotic index episode that could predict a change in the diagnosis during the two years follow-up were analyzed.None of the sociodemographic or clinical variables studied could predict a change in the diagnosis, except for the presence of a control delusion during the index episode. The diagnosis of schizophreniform or not otherwise specified psychotic disorders predicts an evolution towards schizophrenia or affective psychosis while a brief or substance-induced psychotic episode has a better prognosis, with a tendency to maintain the same diagnosis in the 2 years of follow-up.After 2 years of follow-up, an significant number of the patients initially diagnosed of acute psychosis evolved towards a diagnosis of schizophrenia or affective psychosis in a difficult-to-predict way.",

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

      "title": "The Role of NMDA Receptors in Opiate Tolerance, Sensitization, and Physical Dependence",
      "abstract": "When administered acutely, opiates such as morphine produce characteristic behavioral effects, including a decrease in pain responsiveness (analgesia) and an increase in pleasure (euphoria). Because of their profound ability to produce analgesia, opiates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe or chronic pain. Because of their ability to produce positive reinforcement and pleasure, these drugs are widely self-administered and, therefore, represent an important class of abused drugs. Long-term treatment with opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse, leads to three well-known consequences: tolerance, which is a decrease in an effect of a drug with chronic use; sensitization, which is an increase in an effect of drug with chronic use; and physical dependence, which is a physiological change produced by chronic use, such that the absence of the drug results in an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome* (1–3). Tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence are important in both the clinical use of opiates and in their self-administration. For example, the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates may lead to the need to escalate the dose during the treatment of chronic pain, whereas tolerance to the euphorigenic effect may be a factor in the escalation of drug use in addicts (4). Conversely, tolerance to dose-limiting side effects may allow addicts to escalate drug intake and achieve greater euphorigenic effects. The development of sensitization is thought to be involved in the craving that occurs following chronic use of drugs of abuse and, therefore, critical to addiction (5,6). Finally, the avoidance of withdrawal in physically dependent individuals is considered to be an important factor in maintaining self-administration (2,4).",

Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease.

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Some drugs can lead to the development of drug-induced arterial hypertension. The aim of the work is to systematize and analyze the data about drugs that can cause the development of drug-induced hypertension, as well as on epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, risk factors, clinical picture, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment and prevention of drug-induced hypertension. As a result of data analysis, it was revealed that drugs: glucocorticosteroids, antineoplastic drugs, immunosuppressants, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, antidepressants and some others are associated with the development of hypertension. The mechanisms of development of drug-induced arterial hypertension are not fully established and require further study. Drug-induced arterial hypertension is still one of the most common and often unrecognized adverse reactions. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypertension are not speciﬁc. The symptoms are associated with target organ damage or complications of hypertension and may include a headache, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, anxiety, shortness of breath, etc. patients with previously well-controlled hypertension or cases of uncontrolled hypertension. Therefore, it is always necessary to pay attention to the patient’s history, pharmacological anamnesis, rapid increases in blood pressure in patients with previously well-controlled hypertension, or cases of uncontrolled hypertension.",

      "title": "Psicosis dual y cariprazina. Caso clínico",
      "abstract": "Introducción y objetivos: Una de las causas más frecuentes de psicosis es el consumo de sustancias. El consumo de cocaína se asocia a la presentación, transitoria o persistente, de síntomas psicóticos por su potente acción como inhibidor de la recaptación de dopamina. Se presenta un caso clínico de una paciente con TLP y psicosis inducida por cocaína que se ensaya tratamiento con cariprazina. Los criterios diagnósticos para el trastorno psicótico inducido por sustancias según DSM-V son: delirios o alucinaciones, examen físico compatible y resultados analíticos en orina positivos a tóxicos, con síntomas durante o inmediatamente después de la intoxicación o abstinencia de la sustancia psicoactiva. La cariprazina difiere de otros antipsicóticos por su actividad agonista parcial y su mayor afinidad por los receptores D3. Este perfil exclusivo parece tener consecuencias beneficiosas sobre los síntomas negativos, la disforia y el deterioro cognitivo. Estudios realizados apuntan a que la cariprazina reduciría el efecto gratificante de la cocaína sobre el sistema de recompensa y reduciría la necesidad de su consumo. Material y métodos: Descripción de un caso clínico y revisión de la literatura. Resultados y conclusiones: Se presenta el caso clínico de una mujer con antecedente de trastorno límite de la personalidad y trastorno por uso de sustancias (cannabis y cocaína) que consulta por síntomas psicóticos en contexto de consumo de cocaína. Se realiza tratamiento ambulatorio inicialmente con olanzapina y diazepam, siendo su evolución parcialmente favorable, presentando hiperfagia y aumento de peso, por lo que se cambia a cariprazina, mejorando la hiperorexia, el craving a cocaína y manteniéndose abstinente y en remisión de la clínica psicótica. Cariprazina se presenta como una opción para el tratamiento de la psicosis aguda por cocaína y mantenimiento de la abstinencia.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "The Treatment of Acute Agitation in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute agitation is a nonspecific term applied to an array of syndromes and behaviors. It is frequently defined as an increase in psychomotor activity, aggression, disinhibition/impulsivity, and irritable or labile mood. Etiologies of acute agitation include medical disorders, delirium, substance intoxication or withdrawal, psychiatric disorders, and medication side effects. Treatment of acute agitation requires both environmental and pharmacologic intervention. Patients should be calmed with sedating agents early in the course of treatment, allowing for diagnostic tests to take place. Failure to correctly diagnose causes of agitation may lead to delayed treatment for serious conditions, and can even exacerbate agitation.The most common cause of agitation in patients with schizophrenia is psychotic relapse due to medication nonadherence. Pharmacologic treatment options for these patients include lorazepam and antipsychotic agents. Lorazepam causes nonspecific sedation and treats some substance withdrawal, but has little effect on psychosis. First-generation antipsychotics treat psychosis and, at high enough doses, cause sedation, but may induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Some second-generation antipsychotics have been approved for the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia. These agents treat psychosis with a favorable EPS profile, but are comparatively expensive and cause risks such as hypotension. However, avoiding EPS may reduce patients' resistance to antipsychotic treatment. In this expert roundtable supplement, Joseph Battaglia, MD, provides an overview of the definition of acute agitation. Next, Delbert, G. Robinson, MD, outlines evaluation methods for actue agitation. Finally, Leslie Citrome, MD, MPH, reviews interventions for acute and ongoing management of agitation.",

      "title": "An Retrospective Study of Commonly Prescribed Antiepileptic Drugs and it’s Interaction with Other Drugs which are Already in use Respect to Other Disease",
      "abstract": "Antiepileptic drugs (AED) are increasingly used in the treatment of some non-epileptic neurological diseases and psychiatric diseases. Most of the available data on the use of these agents in clinical conditions other than epilepsy are from case series, uncontrolled studies, or small randomized clinical trials, and their apparent efficacy requires confirmation in well-designed large phase III trials. Interactions between antiepileptic drugs or between antiepileptic drugs and other drugs can be pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic. Pharmacokinetic interactions include changes in absorption, distribution ,or eliminate , while pharmacodynamic interactions include synergism and antagonism at the site ,of action. Most clinically significant antiepileptic drug interactions are due to induction or inhibition of drug metabolism. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and primidone are strong inducers of cytochrome P450 and glucuronide enzymes (as well as P-glycoprotein) and may reduce the effectiveness of concomitantly administered drugs such as oral anticoagulants, calcium antagonists, antimicrobial steroids. Mechanism Oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, felbamate, rufinamide, topiramate (at doses ≥ 200 mg/day) and perampanel (at doses ≥ 8 mg/day) have weaker inducing properties and less tendency to produce interactions mediated by enzyme induction. In contrast to enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition results in decreased metabolic clearance of the affected drug, which can increase serum concentrations leading to toxic effects. Examples of important interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition include valproic-induced increases in serum concentrations of phenobarbital and lamotrigine. There are also interactions where other drugs induce or inhibit the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs. Examples include an increase in serum carbamazepine concentration due to erythromycin and a decrease in serum lamotrigine concentration due to estrogen-containing contraceptives. Pharmacodynamic interactions between antiepileptic drugs may also be clinically important. These interactions can have potentially beneficial effects, such as the combined therapeutic synergy of valproic acid and lamotrigine, or adverse effects, such as the mutual potentiation of neurotoxicity in patients treated with a combination of sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs. AEDs are also used to treat psychiatric conditions, particularly bipolar disorder. To date, the AEDs most commonly used to treat this disorder have been carbamazepine and valproic acid, which have shown manic efficacy and likely long-term mood-stabilizing effects in many bipolar patients, including those who are lithium-intolerant. . The availability of new generation AEDs has expanded treatment options for bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, and topiramate appear to show promise in the treatment of bipolar disorder, both as monotherapy and in combination with traditional mood stabilizers. In addition, newer AEDs appear to have a more favorable tolerability and drug interaction profile than older compounds, thus improving compliance",

Depuis la découverte des effets antidépresseurs de la kétamine, il existe un regain d’intérêt pour cette classe de molécules. En effet, la psilocybine et l’acide lysergique diéthylamide (LSD) gagnent de la popularité en tant que traitement pour la dépression et l’addiction, la 3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine (MDMA) pour l’état de stress post-traumatique, et l’ibogaïne pour l’addiction. Malgré des profils pharmacologiques distincts, ces différentes drogues partagent une cinétique d’action similaire : leurs effets thérapeutiques se font ressentir dans les heures suivant l’administration et perdurent au-delà de leur élimination par l’organisme. Ceci suggère des mécanismes plastiques et neurogéniques impliquant entre autres des facteurs trophiques. Cette revue explorera la littérature concernant les effets de ces différents composés sur les neurotrophines, ainsi que les adaptations plastiques qui sont mises en place dans les heures et jours suivant l’administration, afin de comprendre leur potentiel thérapeutique étonnant.",

A patient is associated with major depression when he or she possesses at least five of these clinical symptoms; sadness (also known as depressed mood), lack of concentration, sleeping disorder such as insomnia and hypersomnia, fatigue, loss of interest, lack of appetite, excessive guilt, unworthy feeling and suicidal thoughts. The mentioned symptoms should be present for a minimum period of two weeks for the diagnosis of major depression to be established. Left untreated, major depressive disorder may interfere with daily life activities and eventually leads to suicide, which is one of the leading cause of death in the United States. In this report, the referred case study for major depressive disorder will be the scenario of a 30 year old woman who attempted suicide by consuming 8 bodrex pills. She was given psychotherapy and treated with antidepressant of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group which indeed showed a good improvement on her health.",

During the last decade a chain of research has led to a new insight into the causes and potential alleviation of alcohol craving: Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiate-like substances (endorphins and enkephalins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin, and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroiso-quinolines), can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the craving for alcohol is related to a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiate-like substances as well as other neurotransmitter substances. This deficiency can occur genetically or as a result of prolonged stress or long-term heavy drinking. The neurochemical imbalance may be treated chemically, leading to a possible alleviation of the craving for alcohol, especially in conjunction with psychotherapeutic and counseling regimens.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to describe the different neuropsychological deficits associated to the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), as well as the growing evidence that attributes these deficits to the selective axonal damage to serotoninergic cells brought about by this substance.MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.Most of the neuropsychological disorders found in individuals who take ecstasy on a regular basis can be explained by the selective neurodegeneration processes that the drug appears to produce in the serotonin terminals of the brain in the long run.",

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world. It is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) Disorder\" in ICD-10 and referred in some literature as \"dermatillomania\". ED is characterized by, but not invariably, the compulsive urge to pick, squeeze or scratch skin surfaces experienced by patients. Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "title": "SUPPRESSION OF TENEURIN-4 IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS ALLEVIATES METHAMPHETAMINE-INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE AND BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN MICE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background According to the World Drug Report 2022 from United Nations, amphetamine-type stimulants take third place in worldwide drug addiction, primary methamphetamine (METH) [1]. And over 30,0000 people died from drug overdoses induced by stimulants combined with other drugs [2]. METH is recognized as a widely distributed psychostimulant with a strong addictive potential that impacts the central nervous system and body health [3]. METH predominantly exerts its influence on the limbic system through the stimulation of the release of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical element of the brain's reward circuitry. Both short-term and prolonged METH use can result in lasting physical and mental health complications, some of which may endure indefinitely. Over the last decades, significant social problems associated with METH have gotten worse over the past few decades, especially after COVID-19 [1, 2]. Aim &amp; Objectives Our previous data revealed several genes associated with METH, including Odz4 gene. The Odz4 gene encodes teneurin-4 (TENM4) protein which belongs to one subtype of type II transmembrane teneurin proteins (TENM1-4) [4]. Genetic studies have indicated a correlation between teneurin proteins and developmental issues, neurological disorders, and drug residence [5]. Recently, some clinical research found that the Odz4 gene has an abnormal mutant in the brain of patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [6, 7]. Based on the aforementioned research, it is suggested that TENM4 might play a role in the progress of drug addiction. Here we investigated the performance of TENM4 knockdown in METH-induced dopamine release of NAc shell and behavior alterations in mice. Method We administered METH or saline subcutaneously to mice for six consecutive days. Two hours after the final injection of METH, we sacrificed all mice and preserved them under 80°. Then we investigated the changes in Odz4 mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and WB, respectively. Subsequently, we injected AAV-carrying Odz4-targeting gRNA involved CRISPR-Cas system into the NAc After four weeks of the injection, we assessed the time response of dopamine in NAc by in vivo microdialysis and alteration of conditioned place preference induced by METH. Results We found a significant increase in Odz4 mRNA and TENM4 protein levels in the NAc region after continued METH administration. We confirmed the knockdown effect by AAV injection of the NAc of mice. The TENM4 knockdown exhibited an attenuated response of dopamine and place preference induced by METH. Discussion and Conclusion These results indicate the association between TENM4 and the pharmacological effects of METH in NAc region of mice. However, addiction behaviors affected by the knockdown of TENM4 and its specific mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear and require further investigation.

      "title": "Nosology of Somatoform Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is a clear lack of consensus regarding definitions and nosology in somatoform syndromes, and this is obvious with a cursory review of the clinical literature. Outside of the clinical context, the use of such terms as hysteria, somatization, somatoform disorders, functional somatic syndromes, and medically unexplained symptoms is even more bewildering for patients and nonmedical personnel. Typically, a diagnosis is a descriptive label used to convey information about the nature and cause of a syndrome, disorder, or disease. A good diagnosis not only should convey descriptive information but also should communicate information about prognosis and treatment/management possibilities. In thinking about diagnoses and how they ideally work, an oversimplified example using the common medical diagnosis of hypertension is instructive. Hypertension is chronically elevated blood pressure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures above certain levels (measured in millimeters of mercury) are considered indications of high blood pressure. Provided that a diagnosis of hypertension is arrived at through well-recognized methods, various forms of treatment or management are indicated. These might include the use of antihypertensive medication, dietary changes, exercise, and/or lifestyle alterations, or a combination of these treatments. While there are doubtless debates about subtleties of determining at-risk levels, methods of measurement, and therapeutic approaches, the basics of a diagnosis of hypertension seem clear.",

Recent studies suggest that 25-40% of people who suffer a psychotic episode recover and never have another episode. A number of non-specific cognitive, affective and behavioural changes often herald the onset of psychosis. Higher than recommended doses of antipsychotics do not produce quicker or better outcomes, only more side-effects. Maintenance antipsychotic medication is required to reduce the risk of relapse. Psychosocial interventions must accompany medication. The most serious psychiatric complications are depression and suicide. GPs are well placed to promote good health and provide advice on minimising risk factors such as smoking. It is important to actively involve the patient in all aspects of his or her care and not to place excessive emphasis on 'compliance'. (author abstract)",

      "abstract": "Subjective complaints or somatoform symptoms beyond the case threshold (ICD-diagnoses) occur in 12% of the normal population. In recent studies prevalence is at least 17% in primary care. Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

El consumo de drogas entre la clase medica, y en concreto en la especialidad de anestesiologia (1, 2) , representa un gran problema ocupacional, debido a que involucra la drogadiccion en el ambito laboral del medico. Estas situaciones pueden derivar en un proceso de degradacion progresiva del profesional en su vida personal, profesional y en su salud. En ella pueden interactuar diversos factores, como la predisposicion genetica, factores psicosociales, biologicos, historia familiar y personal de abusos, estres laboral cronico y el facil acceso y disponibilidad a la droga en el trabajo. La drogodependencia puede generar consecuencias personales, familiares y laborales (3, 4) . Las personales se relacionan con un progresivo deterioro en su vida y en su salud, sindrome de abstinencia, trastornos de angustia, depresion, llegando a la muerte por suicidio y por sobredosis. Las familiares se vinculan a altas tasas de divorcios y patrones de desmembramiento familiar. Las laborales tienen que ver con incapacidad de realizar sus tareas habituales, probabilidad de errores medicos, pudiendo llegar incluso a la mala praxis. Ante la mas minima sospecha, se debe realizar un proceso de identificacion y la correspondiente intervencion, para ayudar al medico e incluirle en programas de tratamiento especificos. Enfrentados a esta realidad, debemos asumir el concepto de responsabilidad compartida desde una triple perspectiva que involucre al anestesiologo, a las sociedades cientificas y a las instituciones implicadas en la contratacion del personal medico para lograr terminar, desviar o disminuir estos riesgos.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Social Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is the fear of public scenarios leading to avoidance of social situations or causing individuals to endure intense feelings of anxiety. SAD impedes a person's ability to interact with the world around them. Research evidence to date suggests potential causes of SAD include psychological factors (serious family conflict, abuse, or extremely disturbing events), environmental factors especially in children (excessive teasing, bullying, rejection at home, school or work, or ridicule), developmental factors (temperament, physical appearance, or conditions which attract attention), brain structure, and genetic variations. This is complicated by the fact that about 90% of the people suffering from SAD also suffer from other disorders. People suffering from SAD may also suffer with other disorders such as major depressive disorder related to chronic isolation, other anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorder, schizophrenia, and some eating disorders which cause the person to avoid eating in front of others. SAD will typically develop before other disorders, except for individual phobias and separation anxiety disorder. In 2022, the American Psychiatric Association published ten criteria for use in diagnosing SAD. The World Health Organization identified differences between impairment patterns in countries, however similarities emerged including onset at a young age, persistence, impairment, and that the threshold for diagnosis is very close irrespective of geography or income levels. People suffering from SAD improve from two types of medical treatment used separately or together: psychotherapy (talk therapy to change ways people think and act) and medications to relieve symptoms (antianxiety, antidepressants, and a beta-blocker for heart-related symptoms). The use of medications is predominantly safe and effective, although it may take trying several different drugs to identify the best ones for a patient. The use of complementary and alternative medicine is expanding and includes relaxation techniques, meditation, yoga, and logging or journaling. Complementary health care is used alongside conventional medicine, while alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Combating SAD is more important now because of the COVID-19 pandemic but there have been great strides towards alleviating symptoms and improving the lives of those affected.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

Pathological Habit Disorder (PHD) points to treatment options where the syndrome is wholly or partly habit-driven. Whether the syndrome is habit-driven or not will remain a clinical judgement even though many conditions, previously thought immutable except by medication, are proving accessible to behavioural engineering. In the ICD system, PHD seems to fit in “Special Symptoms or Syndromes not elsewhere Classified”. It is demonstrably useful to have a diagnosis such as PHD and to incorporate it into the body of medical classification, recognizing current practices for dealing with unwelcome or damaging habits.",

A high percentage of patients with advanced cancer suffer debilitating fatigue that has a severe and profound impact on their lives. Fatigue may be caused or exacerbated by numerous factors, including the disease itself and its treatment, or multiple other interrelating symptoms such as dyspnoea, cachexia, anaemia and psychological distress. Continuous assessment of fatigue is a critical component of care for the patient with this debilitating symptom. Initial assessment should incorporate a detailed description of the patient’s fatigue history, its development, symptoms of the condition and any potential causes. Individualised management strategies that may include a combination of interventions can be administered to meet the specific needs of each patient. This article examines the nature of fatigue in advanced cancer, possible causes and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Conflicts of interest: none",

      "title": "Estudio comparativo de la acción psicofarmacológica y analgésica de extractos de plantas de uso terapéutico tradicional con antidepresivos inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de monoaminas",
      "abstract": "El dolor es una manifestacion clinica frecuente cuyo tratamiento esta lejos de ser optimo, aunque en los ultimos anos se han producidos avances muy significativos. A esto hay que sumar el hecho de que el dolor suele acompanarse de otras enfermedades comorbidas entre las que destacan la depresion, la ansiedad, el deterioro cognitivo y las alteraciones del sueno. Los antidepresivos son farmacos frecuentemente utilizados en el tratamiento del dolor, bien solos o en combinacion con otros analgesicos. Su utilizacion se debe principalmente a dos motivos: por su accion analgesica en algunos cuadros clinicos de dolor neuropatico, y por sus propiedades antidepresivas, logicamente, e incluso ansioliticas en algunos casos. Hasta el momento, no se conoce con exactitud el mecanismo de accion por el cual los antidepresivos producen su efecto analgesico, ni tampoco las diferencias entre ellos en el contexto del dolor. Centrandonos en las investigaciones preclinicas, es necesario de cara a un futuro desarrollo de nuevos farmacos antidepresivos analgesicos, conocer la sensibilidad de los diferentes modelos de dolor a los mecanismos especificos de accion antidepresiva. Los antidepresivos con alguna excepcion suelen ejercer su accion farmacologica inhibiendo la recaptacion de monoaminas, concretamente serotonina y noradrenalina, y este mismo mecanismo parece ser el que les concede actividad analgesica. Asimismo, este mecanismo les hace poseer accion ansiolitica. Es necesario por tanto en psicofarmacologia preclinica, discernir sobre la capacidad de los diferentes antidepresivos para inducir efecto antidepresivo, analgesico y ansiolitico en diferentes metodos que puedan servir para orientar la investigacion futura en este campo. Tambien es necesario conocer su capacidad de producir efectos sobre la cognicion ya que su uso cronico puede derivar en un deterioro cognitivo . Un aspecto de gran importancia y que ha constituido uno de los objetivos de esta tesis es saber el rango de potencia en relacion con la dosificacion de los antidepresivos y su mecanismo de accion como agentes capaces de inducir efecto analgesico y ansiolitico. Es decir, es importante conocer si las dosis a las que se evidencia un efecto analgesico son las mismas a las que se observa un efecto ansiolitico y tambien relacionar este orden de potencia con los efectos cognitivos. Como quiera que el mecanismo de accion de los antidepresivos esta relacionado con la inhibicion de la recaptacion de serotonina y noradrenalina y que los rangos de potencia para inducir este efecto son diferente entre ellos, es de importancia saber que modelos son mas sensibles a un mecanismo u otro. Es decir, es de interes conocer que modelos son mas especificos para detectar un efecto serotoninergico o noradrenergico o los dos, en relacion con el efecto antidepresivo, ansiolitico, analgesico y cognitivo. Tambien es importante, puesto que la mayor parte de los modelos son interferidos por la posible capacidad que tienen los antidepresivos de producir cambios en la motricidad, conocer si los efectos que observamos estan o no relacionados con estos cambios motores, con el fin de no inducirnos a error en futuras investigaciones.",

      "abstract": "Abstract While it has been vital to identify discriminating features for each personality disorder, including NPD, to be able to differentiate them from each other and from other mental illnesses, it has also proved to be of increasing clinical importance to identify the presence of pathological narcissism in other mental conditions and disorders. Co-occurring narcissistic features can have major implications for course and prognosis, as well as for the overall and in-depth understanding of the patient. Pathological narcissism can also have a major impact on the individual’s experiences of and attitudes toward treatment, and influence his or her motivation to engage in a treatment alliance and comply with treatment recommendations, even when the primary diagnosis is not a narcissistic disorder. The role of major psychiatric symptoms, such as bulimia or anorexia, in narcissistic self-esteem regulation is a relatively new avenue of inquiry (Steinbergb &amp; Shaw, 1997). In addition, narcissistic symptoms in other disorders may be overshadowed or erroneously attributed to other more predominant symptoms (Simon, 2001). This chapter provides an overview of the clinical and empirical observations that can describe and explain some of the specific interactions between NPD/pathological narcissism and near-neighbor disorders and other major mental conditions.",

      "abstract": "Iatrogenic disorders are an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and admission to hospital. Although drug induced myopathies may be individually uncommon, they are nevertheless an important group of disorders that must be considered when evaluating any patient presenting with muscular symptoms. Their importance lies in the fact that unlike many other neuromuscular disorders they are potentially reversible once the offending agent is withdrawn, whereas failure to recognise their iatrogenic nature will result in unnecessary morbidity and, in some instances, even a fatal outcome.\n\nA variety of drugs used in different branches of medicine are potentially myotoxic (table 1), or can cause muscle weakness and fatigue through an effect on neuromuscular transmission or peripheral nerve function.1,2 Some drugs such as the glucocorticoids have a predictable dose related effect and will induce myopathic weakness in any individual treated with sufficiently large doses for long enough. On the other hand, in the case of drugs such as the statins, myopathy only develops in a relatively small proportion of individuals suggesting that there is an idiosyncratic vulnerability, the nature of which is poorly understood. While the potential for glucocorticoids, statins, and a number of other therapeutic agents to cause myopathy is well established, in the case of some of the other drugs that have been implicated in case reports the evidence is more tenuous and an aetiological link remains unproven.\n\nView this table:\n\n TABLE 1 \nDrugs that may cause myopathy \n\n\n\nDrugs can induce various pathological types of myopathy and the resulting clinical manifestations are equally variable, ranging from mild myalgia or muscle cramps to profound generalised muscle weakness which may be accompanied by myoglobinuria and acute renal failure in patients with severe rhabdomyolysis (table 2).

All types of psychotropic drugs, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants, thymoregulators, neuroleptics, and beta-blockers are used, with two main indications: (a) to prevent or to treat the withdrawal syndrome and (b) to diminish the psychopathological factors related to alcoholism (anxiety or depression, for example), in order to avoid pathological recourse to alcohol. Recently, attempts have been made to decrease the craving for alcohol in humans after detoxification.

      "abstract": "Disulfiram, a useful medication to deter the relapse of alcohol dependence, has been associated with a number of neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Disulfiram induced delirium is rare in the absence of an ongoing psychosis or a disulfiram- ethanol reaction. We present the case of an alcohol dependent patient who had a past history of both an alcohol-induced psychotic episode (which had resolved completely) and alcohol withdrawal seizure. Following inpatient detoxification and induction on disulfiram, to which he was compliant and maintaining totally abstinent, he developed an acute delirious state 6 weeks after disulfiram. It was characterized by fluctuating disorientation, marked inattention, affective lability, increased psychomotor activity, irrelevant speech, social disinhibition, at times staring, talking to self and gesturing in air, and sleep-wake cycle reversal with evening worsening of symptoms. He was re-hospitalized and symptoms subsided by 72 hours after stopping disulfiram. The diagnostic dilemma associated with such a presentation is discussed, along with the putative mechanisms and clinical pointers.",

It is usually classified as mild, moderate, severe, or extreme (body temperature below 18-20 degrees C; no recordable EEG activity). However, exposure time, trauma, serious illness, or the effects of drugs or alcohol may both attenuate and complicate the clinical course. This paper describes exposure mechanisms, the pathophysiologic processes, the body's thermo-regulating mechanism and diagnostic criteria. The author also discusses choice of treatment in the acute stages, during transportation and in hospital. The treatment should take into account not only the degree of hypothermia, but also exposure time, state of consciousness, and complicating factors such as trauma, drugs or alcohol. When hypothermia is associated with cardiac arrest, rewarming by extracorporal support is recommended.",

The chapter indicates treatment implications for youth and families experiencing a broad range of DSM-5 disorders. It examines the general characteristics and treatment recommendations regarding: neurodevelopmental disorders; schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar and related disorders; obsessive–compulsive and related disorders; substance-related and addictive disorders; feeding and eating disorders; elimination disorders; sleep–wake disorders; and gender dysphoria. The chapter also provides an overview of intellectual disabilities, communication disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, specific learning disorder, and motor disorders. The DSM-5 includes a number of disorders on the schizophrenia spectrum. Bipolar disorders are considered serious mental illness, have genetic and physiological basis, and may require lifelong management. Body dysmorphic disorder includes obsession, or preoccupation, with \"one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others\".",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

One of the important developments in the modern understanding of DDs is the establishment of a clearer link between trauma and dissociation. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\". The symptoms of depersonalization and/or derealization frequently co-occur in a variety of other psychiatric disorders, primarily in patients with anxiety disorders.",

Caffeine acts as a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist in the central nervous system. Its main effects are as psychostimulant, acting in addition on the respiratory, muscular and cardiovascular systems. Basically, caffeine is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 1A2 enzymes (CYP1A2). Several drugs can interact with its metabolism. The observed interindividual differences of its effects can be explained by variations in its metabolism. The main therapeutic use of caffeine is bronchodilator in respiratory diseases. Other possible uses are under investigation. Acute or chronic consumption of caffeine can induce several adverse effects, including intoxication that can be lethal. Finally, caffeine can be considered a drug of abuse. It has positive reinforcing actions, produces tolerance, and a withdrawal syndrome after stopping its consumption. Caffeine can cause different mental disorders such as dependence, which is not included in the DSM-IV-R, withdrawal syndrome and intoxication. Depending on its use, caffeine can be considered a nutrient, a drug or a drug of abuse.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

ME describes a syndrome where there is general muscle pain associated with evidence of a disturbed nervous system [2]. ME, commonly referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or post-viral fatigue syndrome is a condition in which mental and physical fatigue predominate. It is characterized by gross abnormal muscle fatigue which occurs after relatively mild activity. Other symptoms regularly complained of include sleep disturbance, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, feeling depressed, bouts of low grade fever (not exceeding 38-6°C), increased sensitivity to light, back and neck pain, sore throat, irritable bowel and bladder [3]. The symptoms of ME typically become apparent following a viral infection [4], although other trigger factors have been noted. Vaccinations against cholera, tetanus, typhoid and influenza have been associated with the onset of ME [5]. It has also been observed that any psychological disturbances in ME occur secondary to, or share a common pathophysiology with an immunological dysfunction [6]. In many cases there appears to be no apparent triggering factor [7].",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

Cocaine use can cause psychiatric and physical diseases in the individual, but it can also cause social and legal problems. Genetic, sociocultural and pharmacological factors, some factors related to learning and conditioning have an important role in the etiology of cocaine addiction. Cocaine exerts its psychoactive and addictive effects through the limbic system in the brain, which regulates pleasure and motivation. The nucleus accumbens, which is a part of the limbic system, is the most important region that mediates the effect of cocaine. Cocaine use can often be seen together with other psychiatric diseases, and it can also cause damage by affecting other system organs, especially the central nervous system.

      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder.

En el presente articulo se revisan algunos estudios que han examinado el papel de la ansiedad y/o depresion en la adquisicion y mantenimiento del juego patologico, con el objetivo de aclarar las distintas posturas, extrapolando las conclusiones a otras adicciones.  La revision sugiere la unificacion de criterios teoricos y empiricos para poder establecer la implicacion y direccionalidad de determinados factores psicologicos relacionados con el juego patologico.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric syndrome, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is qualified via impairments in qualitative communication, social interaction, and stereotyped or restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. While all ASDs are considered to have qualitative deficits in social relatedness to others, many people with ASDs have other symptoms, including irritability (which includes aggression, self-injurious behavior, and severe tantrums). In order to decrease these behaviors, it is often helpful to make use of behavioral therapy. In addition, due to the intensity and severity of irritability, adjunctive medications are sometimes needed. Although many of the adjunctive medications have been tested and demonstrated to be useful in treating ASD, no clear standardized treatment has emerged. While the adjunctive medications have shown efficacy, the associated side effects have proven to be a barrier to their accepted use. A traditional Japanese medicine, Yokukansan (YKS), is composed of seven kinds of dried herbs and is widely clinically prescribed for treating psychiatric disorders by acting mainly on the glutamatergic and serotonergic nervous systems. YKS may be safe and useful in treating dementia patients' behavioral and psychological symptoms according to indications from recent studies. We introduce in this review, the ameliorative effects of YKS on Asperger's disorder in open-label studies and on ASDs including pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This review will suggest that YKS is well tolerated and effective for the treatment for subjects with ASD who have severe hyperactivity/noncompliance and irritability/agitation. Additionally, the serotonergic, glutamatergic, anti-inflammatory and neurogenesis effects are explored which are thought to be involved in the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of YKS.",

      "title": "The Clinically Meaningful Link Between Alcohol Use and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.",
      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood mental health disorder that can lead to alcohol and other drug (AOD)-related problems if it persists into adolescence and adulthood. Several findings suggest that ADHD contributes to the development of AOD use disorders. ADHD generally precedes alcohol use and is correlated with developmentally inappropriate levels of alcohol use or abuse; conduct problems typically precede the development of alcohol use or abuse. The potential role of ADHD in the development of AOD use problems has important implications for prevention and treatment of such problems. For example, people with ADHD have poor outcomes from AOD abuse treatment. Service providers who work in AGO abuse treatment settings must develop the diagnostic and clinical expertise to address co-occurring ADHD and AOD use disorders. KEY WORDS: attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; alcohol and other drug dependence; alcoholic beverage; comorbidity; impulsive behavior; symptom; early AODU (alcohol and other drug use) onset, conduct disorder; diagnostic criteria; causal pathways; predictive factor; treatment outcome; correlation analysis; literature review ********** Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood mental health disorder that is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It has been discussed in the psychiatric literature for approximately 100 years under various names, including minimal brain dysfunction; hyperkinetic reaction of childhood; attention deficit disorder; and, since 1987, ADHD. The various names reflect an evolving understanding of the disorder and an increasing consensus on its nature. One of the major recent advances in the research on ADHD is the recognition that most people who are diagnosed with it as children continue to suffer problems related to this disorder as adolescents and adults (Barkley 1998; Tucker 1999). This recognition that ADHD extends beyond puberty has expanded ADHD research into new areas, including the link between ADHD and alcohol use and abuse. To provide the appropriate background for understanding the link between ADHD and alcohol use, this article first summarizes the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. It then examines the hypothesis that ADHD is a causal factor in the development of problematic alcohol consumption. Finally, the article reviews some preliminary research suggesting that ADHD and its treatment may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of alcohol-related problems. DIAGNOSIS OF ADHD According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) (2000), the rate of ADHD in the general population of children in the United States is between 3 and 7 percent. Among children receiving treatment for psychiatric disorders in clinical settings, however, this rate often exceeds 50 percent (Barkley 1998), making ADHD one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders for children in the United States. The rare of ADHD in adults is thought to be somewhat lower than in children, probably between 2 and 5 percent in the general population (Barkley 1998). For adults in clinical settings, the rate of ADHD is currently unknown bur appears to be substantially elevated compared with the general population. Among adult patients receiving treatment for alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse, the rate of ADHD has been estimated to be approximately 25 percent (Wilens 1998). A similar rare of ADHD, about 30 percent, has been found among adolescents in treatment for AOD use disorders (AODD) (Molina et al. 2002). These relatively high rates indicate that it is important for service providers in AOD-abuse treatment settings to be able to diagnose and treat ADHD. The symptoms or problems associated with ADHD vary somewhat depending on the patient's developmental stage (Barkley 1998). Children with ADHD typically present with academic difficulties, discipline problems at school and at home, and conflicts with peers. …",

      "abstract": "Chemical dependency is a common, chronic disease that affects up to 25 percent of patients seen in primary care practices. The treatment goal for patients recovering from chemical dependency should be to avoid relapse. This requires physicians to have an open, nonjudgmental attitude and specific expertise about the implications of addiction for other health problems. First-line treatment for chemical dependency should be nonpharmacologic, but when medication is necessary, physicians should avoid drugs that have the potential for abuse or addiction. Medications that sedate or otherwise impair judgment also should be avoided in the recovering patient. Psychiatric illnesses should be aggressively treated, because untreated symptoms increase the risk of relapse into chemical dependency. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help to lower alcohol consumption in depressed patients, and desipramine may help to facilitate abstinence in persons addicted to cocaine. If insomnia extends beyond the acute or postacute withdrawal period, trazodone may be an effective treatment. If nonpharmacologic management of pain is not possible, nonaddictive medications should be used. However, if non-addictive medications fail, long-acting opiates used under strict supervision may be considered. Uncontrolled pain in itself is a relapse risk.",

Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

Results show that there are no significant differences in posttreatment adjustment ratings between the age groups. In addition, it was found that older depressives with a longer history of depression adjust less well than expected. Lastly, older depressives (relative to younger ones), particularly neurotic ones, show the following pattern of adjustment: Less alienation, less vigor, less confidence in skills, poorer work history, less abuse of alcohol or drugs, more social constriction, more agitation, and fewer household management skills.",

Patients with chronic and severe mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as those with substance use disorders (SUDs) tend to exhibit high rates of nonadherence (e.g., 50% or greater) to their medication and psychosocial treatments [2-7]. Not surprisingly, then, nonadherence rates tend to be highest in SMI patients who also abuse drugs or alcohol compared with noncomorbid patients [8]. Nonadherence in co-occurring SMI and SUDs produces a host of negative consequences, including increased rates of relapse, hospitalization, suicide, and functional impairment [5,9-11]. Abrupt withdrawal from psychotropic medications for SMI can lead to a quick return of symptoms that is not just attributable to the original illness, but also due to potential rebound effects associated with withdrawal from medications [12,13]. Furthermore, premature treatment drop out averages 50% within the first few weeks of SUD treatment [4-6], which prevents early intervention that can alter illness trajectories and provide needed course corrections prior the development of clinical crises. Nonadherence also contributes to the so-called “efficacy-effectiveness gap” [14]. We spend large amounts of money and resources developing efficacious mental health treatments, but these interventions will have little public health impact unless patients view them as acceptable and adhere to them.",

      "abstract": "The intentional killing of oneself can be seen as evidence not only of personal breakdown, but also of a deterioration of the social context in which an individual lives. Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with upheavals in personal relationships, through alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-reported because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see Definition and comparability).",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

These are: (i) behavioral addictions can occur concurrently, (ii) addictions such as videogame addiction are associated with other comorbidities and are therefore not separate disorders, (iii) ‘addictions’ are equivalent to ‘disorders’ in DSM-5 and ICD-11 nomenclature, (iv) very excessive behaviors are addictions, and (v) socially condoned excessive activities and activities engaged in willfully cannot be classed as behavioral addictions. It is argued that views based on these myths depend upon how behavioral addictions are defined in the first place. It is concluded that any behavior which has severe and longstanding clinical impairment and comprising core components of addiction (i.e., salience, conflict, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, and relapse) should be conceptualized as a behavioral addiction.",

Understand the usual range of symptoms and associated behaviors that are seen after a person has a significant loss, including psychological symptoms, health behavior, and use of alcohol and medications. 2. Learn the course of “normal” symptoms of bereavement in the first year after the death of a loved one. 3. Distinguish between the similarities and differences in ‘normal’ bereavement symptoms and the syndrome of depression and its course, as compared to the symptoms and course of the psychiatric disorder, major depression. Bereavement is a universal human experience that most people endure with minimal morbidity. However, for some, losing a loved one can lead to the development of a psychiatric illness like chronic depression, the exacerbation of a substance use disorder or persistent complex bereavement disorder or to increased general medical morbidity or mortality. Thus, it is important to recognize the clinical features and time course of “normal” bereavement so that ordinary grief isn’t pathologized and to facilitate recognition of these important complications.",

Its development in a hospitalized patient may interfere with his or her management, disrupt ward routine, and cause medicolegal complications as a result of patient injury. Acute onset of a fluctuating level of awareness, accompanied by sleep-wake cycle disruption, lethargy or agitation, and nocturnal worsening of symptoms, are diagnostic.

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "title": "Cancer Symptom Clusters: Old Concept But New Data",
      "abstract": "Individuals with cancer have multiple symptoms, which frequently co-occur. A nonrandom distribution of symptoms suggests a common mechanism. Symptom clusters (SCs) were considered part of various syndromes in the early years of medicine. The SC concept in clinical medicine is old. Symptom clusters were commonly described in the psychology/psychiatry and neurology literature. Symptom cluster may be defined either clinically or statistically. Statistically derived clusters can differ from clinically defined clusters. The clinical importance of statistically derived clusters is unclear. Pain-insomnia-fatigue and pain-depression-fatigue are commonly recognized clinical clusters. Nausea-vomiting and anxiety-depression are also statistically observed clusters. The longitudinal stability of clusters is unknown. Certain SCs, appear to have a greater adverse influence on outcomes (such as performance status and survival) than others. Comorbidities probably influence symptoms at different levels, but their effect on cancer clusters is unknown. Comprehensive symptom assessment is crucial to cluster identification. The potential use of the cluster concept to abbreviate symptom assessment tools needs validation. Symptom cluster can be disease and/or treatment related and may change as individuals undergo antitumor therapies. Polypharmacy in symptom management is frequent but could be minimized if 1 drug could be used to treat cluster symptoms. Symptom cluster appears to vary with the assessment tool, disease stage, symptom domain used to cluster, cluster methodology, and number of symptoms assessed. The validity and reliability of SCs need universally accepted statistical methods, assessment tools, and symptom domains. For now, nausea-vomiting is recognized as a consistent cluster across multiple studies. Pain-depression-fatigue and pain-insomnia-fatigue are also well recognized. Symptom clusters may help in cancer diagnosis, symptom management, and prognostication. However, the cluster method, reliability, and validity need to be established before assessment or treatment guidelines are established. Symptom clusters require further research before becoming part of routine medical symptom assessment and management.",

      "abstract": "A psychological illness where people dread losing their connection to their mobile phones is known as nomophobia, or NO mobile phone phobia. Based on definitions from the DSM-IV, the term \"nomophobia\" refers to a \"phobia for a particular or specific things.\" When someone uses their phone excessively, there are a number of psychological issues at play, such as low self-esteem and an outgoing personality. The weight of this issue is currently growing on a global scale. NOMOPHOBIC symptoms may also be triggered by other mental illnesses, such as panic disorder, social anxiety, or social phobia. It is very difficult to tell if a patient develops NOMOPHOBIC symptoms as a result of an addiction to cell phones or if their anxiety issues are present [1]. Instances of nomophobia include the following signs and symptoms: tachycardia, anxiety, shaking, sweating, agitation, and altered breathing patterns. Nomophobia can also serve as a stand-in for other mental illnesses. As such, we must exercise extreme caution while diagnosing it. Nomophobia can also be triggered by certain mental illnesses, and vice versa. Because nomophobia shares clinical symptoms with other diseases, it can be extremely tough for clinicians to diagnose and treat patients due to its complexity [2].",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a complex mental illness that is frequently both under-diagnosed and under-treated. The symptoms of bipolar disorder can be confused with other medical illnesses or drug effects or may even be overlooked entirely as extreme character traits. The consequences of delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis are potentially devastating, including loss of employment, impaired relationships and a severely impaired quality of life. This article will review the historic perspectives of bipolar disorder, the diagnostic criteria for the phases of the illness, and the pharmacologic options available to treat this condition. Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, will be reviewed indepth. Based on extensive trial data, reviewed in this article, quetiapine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with other mood stabilizers for the treatment of acute manic episodes of bipolar I disorder. Clinical trials describing the efficacy of quetiapine in other phases of bipolar disorder and in other patient populations are also reviewed. A discussion of the drug profile of quetiapine includes its chemistry, availability, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Preclinical studies, postmarketing surveillance, safety, tolerability and regulatory issues are also evaluated. Finally, potential future directions for quetiapine are discussed, together with a review of key issues in bipolar disorder management and details of the information resources used in preparing this article.",

      "abstract": "Clinicians working with alcohol-abusing or alcohol-dependent patients sometimes face a difficult task assessing their patient's psychiatric complaints because heavy drinking associated with alcoholism can co-exist with, contribute to, or result from several different psychiatric syndromes. In order to improve diagnostic accuracy, clinicians can follow an algorithm that distinguishes among alcohol-related psychiatric symptoms and signs, alcohol-induced psychiatric syndromes, and independent psychiatric disorders that are commonly associated with alcoholism. The patient's gender, family history, and course of illness over time also should be considered to attain an accurate diagnosis. Moreover, clinicians need to remain flexible with their working diagnoses and revise them as needed while monitoring abstinence from alcohol KEY WORDS: AODD (alcohol and other drug dependence); diagnostic algorithm; diagnostic criteria; screening and diagnostic method for potential AODD; patient assessment; AODR (AOD related) mental disorder; behavioral and mental disorder; symptom; comorbidity; major depression; manicdepressive psychosis; personality disorder; anxiety; patient family history; medical history The evaluation of psychiatric complaints in patients with alcohol use disorders (i.e., alcohol abuse or dependence, which hereafter are collectively called alcoholism) can sometimes be challenging. Heavy drinking associated with alcoholism can coexist with, contribute to, or result from several different psychiatric syndromes. As a result, alcoholism can complicate or mimic practically any psychiatric syndrome seen in the mental health setting, at times making it difficult to accurately diagnose the nature of the psychiatric complaints (Anthenelli 1997; ModestoLowe and Kranzler 1999). When alcoholism and psychiatric disorders co-occur, patients are more likely to have difficulty maintaining abstinence, to attempt or commit suicide, and to utilize mental health services (Hetzer and Przybeck 1988; Kessler et al. 1997). Thus, a thorough evaluation of psychiatric complaints in alcoholic patients is important to reduce illness severity in these individuals. This article presents an overview of the common diagnostic difficulties associated with the comorbidity of alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders. It then briefly reviews the relationship between alcoholism and several psychiatric disorders that commonly co-occur with alcoholism and which clinicians should consider in their differential diagnosis. The article also provides some general guidelines to help clinicians meet the challenges encountered in the psychiatric assessment of alcoholic clients. DIAGNOSTIC DIFFICULTIES IN ASSESSING PSYCHIATRIC COMPLAINTS IN ALCOHOLIC PATIENTS A Case Example A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining. `Ifn going to end it all... life just not worth living. The clinician elicits an approximate 1-week history of depressed mood, feelings of guilt, and occasional suicidal ideas that have grown in intensity since the man's wife left him the previous day The client denies difficulty sleeping, poor concentration, or any changes in his appetite or weight prior to his wife's departure. He appears unshaven and slightly unkempt, but states that he was able to go to work and function on the job until his wife left, The scent of alcohol is present on the man's breath. When queried about this, he admits to having 'a few drinks to ease the pain earlier that morning, but does not expand on this theme. He seeks help for his low mood and demoralization, acknowledging later in the interview that really don't want to kill myself, I just want my life back to the way it used to be. The above case is a composite of many clinical examples observed across mental health settings each day, illustrating the challenges clinicians face when evaluating psychiatric complaints in alcoholic patients. The questions facing the clinician in this example include: * Is the patient clinically depressed in the sense that he has a major depressive episode requiring aggressive pharmacological and psychosocial treatment? …",

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

Alcohol may have significance as a risk factor for the perpetrator (culprit, car driver, etc.), as well as for the victim. This is especially clear in cases of violence and assault. Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose-response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo-graphic factors must be taken into account. The populations studied are often selected, e.g., from emergency departments, pathology units (postmortem data), or related to those epidemiological studies based on interviews. There is often a lack of relevant control data.",

      "title": "Management of Systemic Medical Emergencies Associated with Psychotropic Medications",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychotropic medications are known to be associated with certain side effects that can present as medical emergencies. These include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, anticholinergic syndrome, dystonia, akathisia, etc. For these conditions, the etiological relationship of the side effect and the medical emergency is well established. In addition, the use of psychotropic medications is also associated with other side effects, which may mimic a physical illness [Table 1]. It is important to understand that for these side effects, at present, the data is available only in the form of association studies. Patients with these presentations may be encountered in emergency setting, other medical-surgical wards, and in various psychiatric setting. All these presentations require immediate attention. These side effects are mostly considered rare side effects, but when these occur and go unnoticed, then these could be fatal. The recognition of these side effects is usually not straightforward, as the association of these side effects with psychotropic medications require ruling out of other possible causes, and often the final conclusion is made after the acute crisis is resolved. The most common presentation of these side effects is altered sensorium, but depending on the side effect, the presentation can vary from difficulty in vision, to persistent erection, or nonspecific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitation, and constipation. Although most of these side effects are discussed in isolation in the literature, it is important to note that, many patients present with more than one of these rare side effects to the medical emergency. Hence, it is important to carry out a thorough evaluation to rule out all possible side effects and effectively manage the same. In most situations, detection of these side effects requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, taking a proper history, carrying a detailed physical examination, and ordering routine and certain specific investigations. An important issue encountered in such situations is to continue/discontinue the psychotropics, and to determine which psychotropics should be used to address the primary illness, should they be required the in future.Table 1: Medical emergencies associated with use of psychotropic medicationsThe present guidelines provide an overview for the evaluation of patients presenting with medical emergencies associated with psychotropic medications. Figure 1 presents the typical organ systems affected by psychotropic medications which lead to emergency treatment seeking. These guidelines are not a substitute to the clinical knowledge and every patient presenting with these features will require individualized assessment and management. Certain other medical emergencies where the association with psychotropic medications is much better established (such as acute dystonias, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and serotonin syndrome) are discussed separately in another set of guidelines.Figure 1: Typical organ systems affected due to psychotropics which lead to treatment seeking in the emergencyINITIAL ASSESSMENT FOR ESTABLISHING THE ASSOCIATION AND GENERAL MEASURES FOR MANAGEMENT As discussed earlier, the diagnosis of psychotropics-associated medical emergencies (such as aspiration pneumonia, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, etc) requires a high index of suspicion and awareness of the clinicians about the possibility. Whenever a patient with a psychiatric disorder presents with symptoms and signs akin to any medical illness, a possibility of the contribution of the ongoing psychotropic must be kept in mind. The most important aspect of evaluation includes establishing the relationship of the side effect with the ongoing psychotropic medication. A good history taking is of paramount importance in this regard. During the history taking the clinician should not only focus on anamnestic recall of facts but should also review all the available treatment charts (including the investigations and the ongoing medications) [Table 2]. The approach to patients with suspected medical emergency due to psychotropics is presented in Figure 2. While history taking due importance should be given to any recent change in medications, which could be either addition or removal of a medication. This is important from the drug interaction point of view, because, removal of an inhibitor can lead to increase in the serum levels of the ongoing psychotropic medication and resultant side effect. The definite association is usually established based on the temporal association, available evidence in the literature for such an association, response to the withdrawal of medication, and effect of rechallenge [Table 2]. Due importance should be given to the change in the doses of ongoing medications, as some of the side effects may be dose-related.Table 2: History taking in a patient presenting with a suspected side effects associated with the psychotropic medicationsFigure 2: Flowchart for general assessment and management of psychotropic medication induced side effectsAdditionally, a thorough physical examination should be carried out because it can provide important information about other side effects of the medications or other possible etiological factors responsible for or contributing to the clinical picture [Table 3]. For example, fever may provide hint for infections.Table 3: Physical examination and basic investigationsAll possible differential diagnosis in the form of other possible medical diagnosis associated with similar presentations and other medical emergencies (such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, anticholinergic syndrome) associated with the use of psychotropic medications must be considered. The third component of establishing the association is ordering or reviewing the investigations as these may provide information about the possible association of side effect/clinical presentation with the psychotropics or other possible explanations. In all patients, basic investigations must be carried out and any further investigations should be guided by the differential diagnoses considered, and advised by other clinicians. The general management measures should focus on the safety of the patient. Till the other possible cause is not established, it is better to stop/substitute the suspected ongoing psychotropic medication and other medications which may be contributing to the side effect [Table 4]. However, discontinuation/substitution of nonpsychotropic medications should be done in liaison with the concerned specialists, without destabilizing the medical condition. Maintenance of airways, breathing, and circulation is of paramount importance and appropriate measures must be taken to address the same.Table 4: General measures to be followed for managing side effects associated with psychotropicsThe subsequent sections deal with the specific medical emergencies, their assessment, and management. SEIZURES Seizure is a medical emergency which is associated with use of various psychotropics in the therapeutic doses, or in toxic doses. Seizures can also occur as part of withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepine or rapid tapering of benzodiazepine or antiepileptic agents. Seizures in patients on psychotropic could also be a secondary manifestation of other side effects of psychotropics (e.g., seizure secondary to hyponatremia). In this section, we would limit ourselves to the discussion of seizures associated with the use of psychotropics in therapeutic doses. Antidepressants associated with a high risk of development of seizures include amoxapine, bupropion, clomipramine, maprotiline, and mianserin. Among the antipsychotics, the highest risk of seizure is reported with clozapine and chlorpromazine [Table 5]. In general, the risk of seizure is higher for second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). Among the SGAs, a higher risk is associated with clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine.[3] Various risk factors have been reported to predispose to the development of seizures. Among the various risk factors [Table 6], the use of higher dose of psychotropics is reported to be one of the most important risk factor.Table 5: Psychotropics and seizures[1 2]Table 6: Risk factors for seizures[2 4]In terms of clinical manifestations, psychotropic-associated seizures may present as myoclonus, focal seizures, or generalized seizures. Accordingly, the patients may present to emergency with generalized tonic–clonic seizures or report of jerks. While taking history, besides the general issues as discussed earlier [Table 2] the clinician should focus on frequency, typology, and past history of seizures. In addition, while taking history, importance must be given to the doses of psychotropics used, any recent change in the doses, any addition or removal of any medication from the prescription, and other aspects as listed in Tables 2 and 7.Table 7: Specific issues in history taking and physical examination while evaluating the association of side effects with psychotropicsIn terms of differential diagnosis, other medical and neurological diseases should be considered and history taking and physical examination should focus on ruling out the same [Table 7]. Some of the common differential diagnosis can include meningitis, encephalitis due to any cause, other central nervous system infections, metabolic disturbances leading to seizures, stroke, and any kind of brain tumors. It is always advisable to rule out these possibilities and to consider neuroimaging in patients presenting with seizure. Other investigations such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis, autoimmune panel should be done in liaison with other specialists [Table 8].Table 8: Investigations specific for the suspected medication associated emergencyIn terms of management, besides the general measures [Table 4], the first step involves stopping/reducing the dose the offending agent. If a patient presents with status epilepticus then the first aim should be control the seizures and in such a situation loading doses of antiepileptics (phenytoin or levetiracetam) should be considered. In patients presenting with isolated seizures, if then reduction in the dose of the offending agent should be considered, without compromising the efficacy. If there is no alternative to the offending agent, then addition of antiepileptic medication should be considered [Table 9]. While choosing antiepileptic agents, issues of drug interactions and synergistic side effects, and the effect of the antiepileptic on the psychiatric disorder must be kept in mind.Table 9: Specific interventions for the suspected medication associated emergencyGLAUCOMA Acute angle-closure glaucoma can be an ophthalmological emergency associated with the use of some of the psychotropic medications. If not identified in time, the sustained raised intraocular pressure can lead to irreversible axonal damage within the retinal nerve fiber layer and the optic nerve, resulting in irreversible blindness.[16] The blockage of pupil by the psychotropics is usually mediated by adrenergic or anticholinergic properties, or by idiosyncratic nonpupillary blockage. The medications commonly implicated for the acute angle-closure glaucoma include the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (associated with anticholinergic side effects), monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants (MAOIs), phenothiazine, and other antipsychotics (associated with high anticholinergic side effects), benzodiazepines, topiramate, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). While starting various psychotropics the clinicians should be aware of the risk factors for angle-closure glaucoma [Table 10] and preferably medications with a lower risk of angle-closure glaucoma should be chosen.Table 10: Risk factors for acute angle-closure glaucoma[16 17 18]Acute angle-closure glaucoma can present with a sudden loss of vision, pain in the eye, redness of eyes, headache, blurring of vision, low vision, tunnel vision, seeing halos around the lights, and red eyes [Table 7]. In addition, the patients can also have systemic symptoms like nausea and vomiting.[16] The initial assessment should include a review of the symptoms. Investigations should focus on the assessment of intraocular pressure. Other investigations are determined by the severity of the symptoms [Table 8]. The management involves reduction in the doses or removal of the offending agent [Table 9]. PSYCHOTROPICS AND BLOOD DYSCRASIAS Various psychotropics have been shown to be associated with blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, eosinophilia, and thrombocythemia. Most of the data for this association is in the form of case reports/case series and retrospective studies. Among the various psychotropics, blood dyscrasias are more commonly reported with the use of clozapine. However, it is important to remember that these side effects are not limited to clozapine only, and others drugs [Table 11] can also cause blood dyscrasias. Different mechanisms have been reported to be responsible for these side effects.[19] The incidence of various hematological side effects with clozapine is reported to be: 0.38%–22% for agranulocytosis, neutropenia 0.9%–22%, eosinophilia 0.2%–61.7%, thrombocytopenia 4.8%–17.8%.[24] An important fact to note is that small sample size studies report higher incidence of blood dyscrasias with clozapine, and as the sample size increases the reported incidence reduces. A study from India reported the incidence of eosinophilia with clozapine to be 9.9%, thrombocytopenia to be 8.2%, neutropenia to be 0.6%, and anemia to be 2.2%.[24] The reported incidence rates for other psychotropics are relatively low.Table 11: Blood dyscrasias with various psychotropics[19 20 21 22 23]In terms of clinical manifestations, many of these drug-induced blood dyscrasias may be asymptomatic and are detected only on investigation. However, when symptomatic, these may present with vague or nonspecific clinical features [Table 11]. An important fact to note is that clozapine-associated eosinophilia may be associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, colitis, toxic hepatitis, and pleural effusion. Clozapine-associated eosinophilia has also been reported to predict the development of neutropenia.[25] Clozapine-associated eosinophilia is also reported to be associated with pleural effusion, pancreatitis, myocarditis, colitis, hepatitis.[25] In terms of differential diagnosis, all possible causes of these abnormalities should be considered and ruled out on the basis of proper history, findings of physical examination, and investigations. There are no clear-cut guidelines for the management of neutropenia associated with other psychotropics other than clozapine. However, when these abnormalities are detected, it is better to stop the suspected offending agent, till the definite cause is not established. For clozapine-associated mild neutropenia (1000–1500/mL), stopping clozapine is not recommended. It is suggested that neutrophil count should be monitored thrice-weekly till the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches more than 1500/mL. In case the patient presents with moderate neutropenia (500–1000/mL), then stopping of clozapine is recommended and daily monitoring of ANC count is to be done till ANC reaches till >1000/mL, and then monitor thrice-weekly till ANC >1500/mL and then weekly for 4 weeks. If the patient presents with severe neutropenia (<500/mL), then clozapine should be stopped, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be started in consultation with hematologist and re-exposure to clozapine should be avoided in persons presenting with severe neutropenia.[26] Other measures involving management of hematological abnormalities should focus on the management of infections if present, prevent bleeding and blood loss and any kind of thrombosis. THROMBOEMBOLISM Many psychotropics have also been shown to be associated with the development of thromboembolism and this can manifest as venous thromboembolism or pulmonary thromboembolism. The available data suggest the association of thromboembolism with both FGAs and SGAs, with risk higher for the latter group of antipsychotics. The antipsychotics that have been linked to thromboembolism include chlorpromazine, haloperidol, prochlorperazine, clozapine (possibly higher risk than other antipsychotics), olanzapine, and risperidone.[2728] Although there is data in the form of case reports linking the association of antipsychotics such as quetiapine, large-scale data does not confirm the same.[2728] Aripiprazole has been in general not reported to be associated with increased risk of thromboembolism.[2728] Similarly, the use of antidepressants, i.e., TCAs, SSRIs, and other antidepressants have also been shown to be associated with increased risk of development of venous thromboembolism.[29] In this regard, it is important to be aware of the risk factors commonly associated with the development of venous thromboembolism and while prescribing antipsychotics, the clinicians should take these factors into consideration. These factors include immobilization due to any cause, receiving hormonal therapy, obesity, higher age, presence of varicose veins or venous insufficiency, dehydration, and thrombocytophilia.[27] The venous thromboembolism may present with leg pain or tenderness in the thigh region, leg swelling, or reddish discoloration of the skin, and raised temperature in the local area. The pulmonary thromboembolism manifests in the form of shortness of breath, tachypnea, tachycardia, and chest pain. In terms of management, the offending agent(s) should be stopped, and as with other drug-induced conditions other possible causes must be ruled out. Once diagnosed, thrombolysis with intravenous unfractionated heparin should be started with close monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR).[27-29] HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia is one of the common electrolyte imbalance reported to be associated with the use of psychotropics of various classes. Among the various psychotropics hyponatremia is often reported in patients on antidepressants (mainly SSRIs), followed by carbamazepine, and antipsychotics. Hyponatremia has been rarely also noted with the use of benzodiazepines/anxiolytics. The incidence rates of hyponatremia with various psychotropics vary widely, mainly influenced by the sample size, and the cut-off value of sodium used to define hyponatremia. The incidence rates of hyponatremia with SSRIs vary from 0.06% to 40%,[30] with studies based on larger sample size reporting lower incidence rates. Studies which have compared various antidepressants suggest that the incidence rate of hyponatremia is lower with TCAs when compared to SSRIs. In terms of antipsychotics, there is data in the form of case reports or small observational studies which have reported the association of hyponatremia with risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and clozapine. In terms of FGAs hyponatremia has been reported to be associated with the use of phenothiazines. Mood stabilizers such as carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine have also been reported to be associated with hyponatremia with the incidence rate with carbamazepine in the range of 4.8% to 41.5% in small sample size studies. Among the various benzodiazepines and Z-category drugs, clonazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, triazolam, alprazolam, temazepam, clorazepate, and zolpidem have also been shown to be associated with hyponatremia in various case reports. Among the various mechanisms, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion has been reported to be the most common mechanism responsible for psychotropic associated hyponatremia.[31] Many studies have evaluated the risk factors for the development of hyponatremia with psychotropics [Table 12]. Most of this literature is available in relation to antidepressants.Table 12: Risk factors for development of hyponatremia associated with psychotropics[31 32]The clinical presentation of hyponatremia is influenced by the severity of hyponatremia, i.e., mild (130–134 mmol/l), moderate (125–129 mmol/l) and severe (<125 mmol/l) hyponatremia. Often the hyponatremia is asymptomatic, but when symptomatic the patient may report of symptoms such as headache, confusion, muscle cramps, lethargy and severe agitation. Patients with serum sodium level <120 mmol/l can present with symptoms like seizures, delirium, stupor, Cheyne–Stokes breathing, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and coma. It is important to note that the initial manifestation of hyponatremia may be nonspecific and actually the manifestation may overlap with a manifestation of depression (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, confusion) or other side effects of the ongoing medications (e.g., gait disturbances, vomiting, fatigue). Hence, it is important to take a proper history and if there is worsening of these symptoms after the starting of the psychotropics, a possibility of hyponatremia should be considered. Whenever a patient on psychotropics, especially antidepressants, reports worsening of symptoms (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, confusion) within few days of starting the medications or presents to emergency or medical ward with seizures, other neurological signs, and symptoms or altered sensorium/stupor or coma, a possibility of hyponatremia should be considered. These patients need to undergo detail assessment, which include proper history taking, physical examination, and appropriate investigations [Tables 7 and 8]. The basic purpose of a detailed assessment should be establishing the diagnosis of psychotropic-related hyponatremia and ruling out all other possible causes [Table 13].Table 13: Differential diagnosis of psychotropic associated hyponatremiaThe treatment of hyponatremia is usually guided by the severity of the hyponatremia and the clinical manifestations. Whenever a medication is suspected to be the possible cause of hyponatremia, it should be stopped immediately. If the hyponatremia is of mild severity, stopping of the offending agent may be sufficient. However, if this does not lead to improvement of serum sodium levels to the normal range, then water restriction should be considered in addition to the stoppage of offending agent(s). However, if the hyponatremia is of moderate-to-severe nature, then in addition to the stoppage of the offending agent, the patient should be given hypertonic saline, in liaison with the physician [Table 9]. It is important to remember that a rapid correction of hyponatremia should be avoided, as this can lead to central pontine myelinolysis. In addition, while using hypertonic saline infusion, furosemide should be used to prevent the kidney from concentrating urine even in the presence of high levels of anti-diuretic hormone. If the hyponatremia does not improve with these measures, then vasopressin receptor antagonists (conivaptan/tolvaptan) may be considered in liaison with the physicians. The management of hyponatremia due to psychotropics is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of patient with hyponatremiaOnce the hyponatremia improves, rechallenge with the same agent is not recommended, if other alternative agents are available to manage the primary psychiatric illness. In fact, it is suggested that other medications from the same class should be avoided. It is suggested that if a patient has a history of hyponatremia with SSRIs/SNRIs or if the patient develops hyponatremia with a SSRIs/SNRIs, antidepressant-like bupropion, mirtazapine, milnacipran, which are considered to have lower potential to cause hyponatremia may be considered. However, for antipsychotics, the current level of data does not suggest that hyponatremia with one SGA pose risk for the development of hyponatremia with another SGA. Clozapine is reported to improve serum sodium levels and it is considered as an option for the management of primary illness in patients who develop hyponatremia with other antipsychotics. It is recommended that the serum sodium levels should be monitored while the patient is being challenged with a newer agent. It is of paramount importance that, the clinicians are able to identify the persons at high risk for the development of hyponatremia and they take appropriate measures to prevent the same. While starting psychotropics the clinicians should be aware about the risk factors for hyponatremia and should avoid medications with higher potential to cause hyponatremia if other options are available. Further, in persons at high risk of developing hyponatremia, the clinicians should psychoeducate the patient and their family members about the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia and what should be done in such a situation. In addition, the serum sodium should be monitored closely in these patients during the initial phase of treatment, especially when the doses of medications are being increased. The doses of the medications potentially to cause hyponatremia should be increased slowly and other medications which can cause/contribute to hyponatremia should be changed or stopped in liaison with a specialist, without comprising the management of the primary illness for which these agents were being used. CARDIAC SIDE EFFECTS The cardiac side effects of psychotropics include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, QTc prolongation, coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, atrioventricular block, ventricular extrasystole, ventricular bigeminy, ventricular systoles, hypotension, hypertension, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis. Some of the antipsychotics are also known to have a direct depressant effect on the heart and can lead to sudden cardiac death.[3334] Some of the cardiac effects may be due to direct effect of the psychotropics on the heart; others may be an outcome of drug interactions or may be an outcome of the use of concomitant medications, which also have similar cardiac side effects. The cardiac manifestations may also be secondary to other side effects of psychotropics, for example, hyponatremia leading to arrhythmias.[33] However, it is important to remember that these side effects are not clinically significant in most of the patients, but in occasional patients, these can be life-threatening and fatal. Hence, there is a need to monitor the cardiac status of the patients on psychotropics, especially those who are at high risk for developing cardiovascular side effects [Table 14].[34] Another issue to remember is the fact that patients with various psychiatric illnesses have a higher rate of cardiac ailments and are also associated with poor outcome.[3334] Due to all these factors, all patients considered for starting of psychotropics, especially antipsychotics, may be considered for electrocardiography (ECG) and blood pressure evaluation.[3334]Table 14: Patients at high-risk of developing cardiovascular side effects of psychotropics (adapted)[34]Among the various cardiac side effects, those which have a higher risk of fatality include significant QTc prolongation leading to torsade de pointes, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis. QTc PROLONGATION AND TORSADE DE POINTES Various psychotropics have been reported to carry varying risk of QTc prolongation and Torsade de pointes [Table 15]. However, it is important to note that for some of the psychotropics, the data is not available to estimate the appropriate risk of this side effect. The risk of QTc prolongation and Torsade de pointes increases with the increase in the doses of most of the psychotropics which are considered to have a higher risk. Some of the demographic and clinical factors have been reported to be associated with increased risk of QTc prolongation [Table 16]. These must be kept in mind while selecting psychotropics, and whenever possible, the medications with higher risk should be avoided, if there is an option to use medications with lower or no risk of QTc prolongation and Torsade de pointes. Psychotropic medications reported to be associated with sudden cardiac death include chlorpromazine, droperidol, haloperidol, levomepromazine, pimozide, thioridazine, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zotepine, pimavanserine, risperidone, sulpiride, tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline), SSRIs.[36]Table 15: Risk of QTc prolongation with psychotropic medications (adapted)[35]Table 16: Risk factors for QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes[33 35]In majority of the patients, QTc prolongation is asymptomatic and is identified only when the ECG is being monitored. However, some of the patients may present with nonspecific symptoms like lightheadedness, with or without palpitations, syncope or presyncope, and sudden cardiac arrest. Depending on the severity of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, the patients may also present with hypotension. On investigations, the patients may show prolonged QTc along with or without other cardiac rhythm problems. A QTc interval of 420 (±20) ms is considered to be normal in a healthy person after puberty. As per the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society Guideline for Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death QTc interval of >450 ms for men, and >460 ms for postpubertal women are considered to be abnormal.[37] In addition, the evaluation should include reviewing the whole prescription and looking for other medications which can prolong QTc interval, and evaluating the various serum electrolytes disturbances (i.e., looking hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia). Magnesium sulfate can be used in patients in prolonged QT",

      "title": "Understanding subthreshold depression.",
      "abstract": "The concept of subsyndromal, subthreshold or sub-case depression has received considerable attention in recent decades. Judd and colleagues[1] — who reported that patients with depression are symptomatic more than 60% of the time and that most of that time is spent in subthreshold states— proposed the following operational definition of subsyndromal depression: ‘two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia.’\r\n\r\nDistinguishing major depressive disorder from subthreshold depression and distinguishing the different types of subthreshold depression from each other is one example of a fundamental limitation of our current psychiatric nosology. The elaborate classification systems currently in use in psychiatry are based on subjective descriptions of symptoms. The detailed phenomenology includes descriptions of multiple overlapping clinical subtypes, but there are no biological characteristics that distinguish one subtype from another. Moreover, different disorders can exhibit similar clinical symptoms and the same disorder can have different symptomatic patterns in different individuals.[2] In the absence of biological markers, establishing thresholds in terms of frequency, duration or severity of symptoms that define when a symptom cluster becomes ‘psychopathological’ and that distinguish one symptom cluster from another symptom cluster will always be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe original hope for ICD-10 and DSM-IV was that the diagnostic emphasis on observable behaviors (rather than on presumed cognitions) would advance the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories. Based on this approach, the core entity of depressive disorders in DSM-IV became a uniform major depressive disorder with modifiers for different subtypes (e.g., psychotic or atypical) and for circumstances presumed to have clinical significance (e.g., seasonal or postpartum depression).[3]–[5] The authors of ICD-10 recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of affective disorders but did not feel that the related science was sufficiently mature: ‘the relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval’.[5],[9] The reported emphasis of the upcoming DSM-5 on the dimensional aspects of psychopathology may provide an opportunity to more clearly characterize the different manifestations of the different subthreshold conditions along the depressive continuum, but this remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that the depressive symptoms at the major, minor, dysthymic or subsyndromal levels are all integral components of the longitudinal clinical structure of major depressive disorder (MDD), with each symptom level representing a different phase of illness intensity, activity and severity.[1],[2],[6],[7] The different depressive disorders included in official diagnostic systems (i.e., MDD, minor depression, dysthymia) and subsyndromal depression do not represent discrete disorders but, rather, are stages along a dimensional continuum of symptomatic severity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the current nosological problems will require changing the current phenomenology-based classification system to a classification system based on reliable neurobiological findings that takes into consideration the remarkable synchronization of psychological, social and cultural factors with biochemistry and physiology.[3],[4] Studies of the relationship of stress and illness[2],[4] that clarify the inter-related roles of social, psychological and biological factors in the cause, course and outcomes of mental disorders provide one clear example of the potential benefits of this more integrative approach to the conceptualization of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is now broadly accepted that psychological stress may change the internal homeostatic state of an individual. During acute stress adaptive physiological responses occur, including the increased adrenocortical secretion of hormones, primarily cortisol.[2]–[4] Several authors hypothesize that prolonged dysfunction of the stress response system, characterized by either hyper- or hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plays a central role in the etiology and course of mood disorders. There is accumulating evidence supporting the suggestion that depressive disorders include individuals with different treatment response profiles who have abnormalities in HPA axis activity and in immune functions.[3]–[5],[8],[9]\r\n\r\nDespite the fluctuating operational criteria and the current lack of definitive biomarkers for subthreshold depressive states, it is clear that the various subthreshold depressive conditions have a high prevalence in the community and are all associated with psychosocial disability, poor quality of life, and high healthcare costs that increase incrementally in parallel with increases in symptom severity.[1],[6],[7] Moreover, individuals with any of the subtypes of subthreshold depression are more likely to experience full-criteria episodes of MDD and to progress into a persistent, fluctuating depressive condition. Thus, research advances in understanding the neurobiology of subthreshold depression and the related development of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for these conditions could substantially decrease the morbidity associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms that, in spite of their high prevalence and impact, are often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.",

      "title": "The Effect of Insomnia Definitions, Terminology, and Classifications on Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short‐term (up to 3 weeks), and long‐term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative‐hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long‐lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive‐behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "title": "A Comparison of Independent Depression and Substance-Induced Depression in Cannabis-, Cocaine-, and Opioid-Dependent Treatment Seekers",
      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms often coexist with substance use disorders (SUDs). The DSM-IV has identified two distinct categories for depression coexisting with SUDs—independent depression and substance-induced depression. While this distinction has important therapeutic and prognostic implications, it remains difficult to make in clinical practice; the differentiation is often guided by chronological and symptom severity criteria that patients may be unable to precisely provide. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the various substances commonly abused—cannabis, cocaine, and opioids—are equally associated with the two types of depression. Predictors, associations, and other markers may be helpful in guiding the diagnostic process. We, therefore, examined the differences between cannabis-, cocaine-, and opioid-dependent individuals contending with independent depression and those contending with substance-induced depression in regard to several variables, hypothesizing that independent depression is more commonly found in females, and that it is associated with higher symptom severity and psychiatric comorbidity. Cocaine-, cannabis-, and/or opioid-dependent, treatment-seeking individuals underwent a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV-TR disorders after providing consent at our clinical research site; those with co-existing primary depression or substance-induced depression diagnoses were provided with further questionnaires and were entered into this analysis (n = 242). Pair-wise comparisons were conducted between the groups classified as independent versus substance-induced depression with 2-by-2 tables and chi-square tests for dichotomous independent variables, and t-tests for continuous variables. Binomial logistic regression was performed in order to ascertain which of the variables were significant predictors. Women were more likely than men to have independent depression (p < .005). Cannabis dependence was highly associated with independent depression (p < .001), while cocaine dependence was highly associated with substance-induced depression (p < .05). Independent depression was associated with higher Hamilton depression scale scores (16 vs. 10, p < .005), and was more highly associated with the comorbid diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .05). Cannabis dependence (p < .001) and female gender (p < .05) were highly significant predictors of major depression specifically. Gender, cannabis dependence, psychiatric severity, and psychiatric comorbidity have variable, statistically significant associations with independent and substance-induced depression, and may be helpful in guiding the diagnostic process.

Clinical experience has shown that the most common cause of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations in patients infected with COVID-19 (or any serious illness), is delirium.

      "title": "Depression and Pain",
      "abstract": "Dartmouth Medical School, Dartmouth College, Lebanon, New Hampshire. edgar.a.romero-sandoval@dartmouth.eduA LARGE population of patients concomitantly experiences chronic pain and depression or symptoms of depression (52% in pain clinics, or 85% in chronic facial pain dental clinics, for example).1How these two syndromes coexist, interact, reinforce each other, and/or are maintained is poorly understood. It is not known whether pain itself can directly cause depression; if so, whether depression or its symptoms start concurrently with pain or develop while pain is perpetuated is not clear. Is it possible that the treatment of a depressive mood is sufficient to allow patients in chronic pain to return to normal activities and enjoy activities that used to make them happy? In this issue of ANESTHESIOLOGY, Wang et al. describe that acute or chronic pain (rather than stress or inflammation) causes depression-like behaviors in rats.2The authors show through pharmacologic means that the mechanisms by which pain and depression are maintained differ and are partly independent. Ketamine, in doses that did not affect evoked pain-related behaviors (10–20 mg/kg), effectively reduced depression-like behaviors (immobility using the forced swim test, and reduced sucrose preference using the sucrose preference test). Interestingly, ketamine's effects on depression-like behaviors lasted at least 5 days, far outlasting its presence in meaningful concentrations in blood or tissue. In addition, ketamine did not relieve hypersensitivity to tactile stimuli after peripheral nerve injury and yet recovered the rats' normal response to physically react to certain situations and the ability to choose a sweet solution (supposedly pleasurable) over plain water.It seems that, at least in rodents or in the rodent model of chronic pain that the authors used, depression does not contribute to evoked peripheral nerve injury-induced pain-related behaviors. However, in humans depression can exacerbate3or generate pain,4suggesting that the treatment of depression will affect pain in patients. This discrepancy may be due to a difference between our current animal pain models and pain states in humans, or that we measure responses to evoked stimuli in rodents but measure spontaneous pain in patients. It is also possible that other types of rodent chronic pain models correlate better with clinical situations in terms of evoked pain and depression-like behaviors. Likewise, depression is the result of complex processes that are difficult to mimic or determine in rodent models or rodent behaviors. Therefore, the return to normal behavior after ketamine under stress situations may not necessarily reflect a more proper response to such stimuli, or the preference for sucrose solution over water may not necessarily reflect the regain of pleasure for enjoyable activities. Nevertheless, these models are affected by clinically used antidepressants, and Wang et al. observed that these depression-like behaviors in rats were blocked by ketamine, a drug that reduces symptoms of depression in patients.5This finding is indicative of the potential benefits of treating symptoms of depression in patients in pain.This study suggests that depression or symptoms of depression (transient or chronic) are an integral part of the affective or emotional component and a consequence of acute and chronic pain conditions. One wonders to what extent the symptoms of depression contribute to the unpleasantness of pain. Is it possible that patients with chronic pain can improve their quality of life if depression is successfully treated separately? Perhaps effective treatment of depression will allow patients (still in pain) to enjoy their daily life and resume their normal activities, or allow them to perform other activities that enhance the chances to relieve their pain (physiotherapy or exercise). These intriguing conjectures seem less provocative in light of data demonstrating that patients with major depressive disorders have an altered brain processing of pain (increased emotional reactivity in pain anticipation).6Is it possible that under a nondepressed state of mind patients in pain are able to cope better? Perhaps the low efficacy to effectively treat patients with chronic pain7or postoperative pain8will improve if clinicians take the mood of patients in chronic pain more seriously. Should we earnestly consider whether the elimination of a depressive mood has to be a concomitant strategy in the current therapies for pain? In psychiatry the standard of care in managing depression considers that a complete remission of depression is obtained only when all emotional, vegetative, and painful symptoms are treated.4Chronic pain may mask depressive disorders, suggesting that we may have a larger proportion of patients with chronic pain and depressive disorders in our clinics. The benefit of including a comprehensive treatment of depression in patients with chronic pain may have additional implications because depression is one of the most important risk factors for suicide or suicide ideation, and patients with chronic pain have higher rates of suicidal ideation.9,10This study does not rule out the possibility that the effective treatment of pain will result in an improvement of symptoms of depression. Further investigation is warranted. Certainly, in some patients antidepressants reduce both chronic pain and depression. Moreover, even though their maintenance mechanisms can differ, both pain and depression may exacerbate each other in a feedback vicious cycle in some patients, which suggests that the treatment of pain will affect depression. Ketamine seems to act differently from current antidepressants (norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors) because ketamine acts faster as an antidepressant. In addition, ketamine reduces pain. Therefore, one can argue that ketamine may be able to prevent or disrupt more efficiently the interdependence of pain and depression.The study of Wang et al. sheds light on possible improved treatments for chronic pain and sets the foundation to test whether ketamine may play a role in improving the quality of life of this patient population. They have demonstrated that low doses (subanalgesic, which minimized the appearance of undesirable side effects) can produce significant and long-lasting (at least 5 days) effects in depression-like behaviors in rats undergoing nerve injury-induced behavioral hypersensitivity. Ketamine, which may produce enduring antidepressant effects in humans,5has been in clinical use for more than three decades in the United States, and more than 50 yr in Europe. Whether it is safer or more effective than traditional antidepressants for chronic therapy is unknown. Therefore, testing of the Wang et al. hypothesis in patients seems an important next step.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The combination of acute/sub-acute neurological and metabolic derangements should always raise the suspicion of toxicity, either endogenous or exogenous. The adverse effects of psychiatric medications are especially difficult to determine since the psychiatric background of patients is often inaccessible. Clinical Presentation: A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department with dysarthria and uncontrolled tremor, rapidly deteriorating into a complex of severe neurological and metabolic derangements. Only after repeated attempts to take a thorough history was lithium toxicity identified. Conclusion: Thorough, comprehensive history taking, including chronic medications and their substitutes, is essential and lifesaving when potentially lethal medications are involved.",

      "title": "Cannabis, cannabinoids and health: a review of evidence on risks and medical benefits",
      "abstract": "Abstract The legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes has progressed internationally. Cannabis and cannabinoids are advocated for a plethora of medical indications. An increasing number of medical and nonmedical users regularly consume large doses of delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component of cannabis. Aim: to summarize the evidence on (1) risks of recreational cannabis use and (2) effectiveness and safety of medicinal cannabis. Findings on recreational use: Cannabis is mostly used to experience its acute rewarding effects. Regular use of high THC products can produce addiction (cannabis use disorder or CUD). Acute consumption of high THC doses (including unintentionally) can cause time-limited mental, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular problems and motor vehicle accidents. Chronic patterns of cannabis use have been associated with multiple adverse outcomes that are of particular concern among adolescents and young adults, such as, disrupted learning, impaired cognitive performance, reduced educational attainment and an increased risk of CUD, psychosis/schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders and suicidal behaviors. There is debate about the extent to which cannabis use is a cause of these adverse outcomes. Physical health risks (e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular, prematurity and restricted fetal growth, hyperemesis syndrome among others) have also been linked with repeated consumption of cannabis with a high THC content. Findings on medical cannabis use: Herbal cannabis, medicines from extracted or synthetized cannabinoids—often used as adjuvants to standard medicines—may produce small to modest benefits. This is primarily the case in treating chronic pain, muscle spasticity, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and refractory epilepsy (in the case of cannabidiol, CBD). The evidence is inconclusive on their value in treating mental disorders and other medical conditions. Safety: Cannabis-based medicine is generally well tolerated. There is a risk of mild to moderate adverse effects and CUD.",

Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

A straightforward definition of a \"stimulant\" is \"a drug which stimulates some bodily function.\" Cocaine and amphetamine addicts often consume 10 to 50 times as much drug as would be indicated for novice. Also, for both agents there are no prominent physical withdrawal symptoms, except for depression. Almost all addicts become psychotic on one or more occasions. The psychosis is very similar for amphetamine and cocaine and difficult to distinguish from paranoid schizophrenia. A differential neurochemical mediation of euphoria and the psychotic effects of amphetamine and cocaine is hinted at by differences in the clinical features of the two phenomena. Low doses of amphetamine produce moderate euphoria and increased alertness in adults.",

      "abstract": "Making the differential diagnosis of a psychosis associated with psychedelic drugs is a difficult and confusing, but very important, clinical problem. Understanding the interaction between the drug effect, the current stress on the individual, and his characteristic level of ego function not only makes differential diagnosis possible, but has ramifications for treatment and prognosis. This interaction can best be understood by clarifying a number of different factors including the extent of drug use, past personal history, prepsychotic level of functioning, mode of onset of the psychosis, nature of external precipitating factors, and presenting mental status. Three different clinical entities can be found when this is done, each of which presented a psychotic appearance, and in each of which past drug use was involved. These are: 1) An acute response to a drug effect, in which the weakened ego of a borderline individual is overwhelmed and not able to reintegrate when the drug effect wanes. This individual responds well to short term hospitalization with supportive treatment. 2) A gradual shift toward projection, denial and then delusions, and withdrawal even in relatively healthy individuals who take drugs very frequently at a time of a life crisis. The development of alloplastic ego defenses is to avoid a dealing with painful affect, and hospitalization or any treatment which would require confronting this was unsuccessful and just reinforces the new defense structure. 3) Occasional drug use in a schizophrenic may well have no effect on that individual's overall clinical course or response to any mode of treatment. Why the drug experience, a transient stress of ego function, does not have long range consequences is not known, but may be because the ego has learned to adapt to these transient episodes, which are much less threatening than actual events in the individual's life. Three patients were presented who demonstrated these three clinical conditions and their different responses to treatment were noted.",

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

Other symptoms include delusions, thought disorder, psychomotor disturbances, and abnormal affect. To establish the diagnosis, one must rule out other disorders such as alcohol withdrawal delirium or other psychotic disorders. Although it is well recognised, relatively little is known about the condition. Moreover, the pathogenesis and treatment of AIPD are still unclear despite high co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders, high re-hospitalization as well as mortality rates and suicidal behaviour. Therefore, the prognosis appears less favourable. We present a case of young man with AIPD with suicidal attempt secondary to auditory hallucination.

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

      "abstract": "being persecuted.However, a variety of other themes is also possible, for instance the belief that the fillings in one's teeth are radio transmitters receiving extraterrestrial messages, or the belief that some outside agency has added or removed thoughts in one's brain.Negative symptoms, on the contrary, describe loss or significant impairment of normal psychological functions, such as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passivity and apathy, and anhedonia (APA, 2000).Although this reduction in normal functioning may seem less dramatic as positive symptoms, particularly negative symptoms are associated with long periods of hospitalization and poor social functioning.Indeed, a patient's degree of negative symptoms appears to determine whether a patient is still able to function in society.Last, cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia comprise 'executive dysfunctions', including problems in maintaining goals, allocating attentional resources, evaluating and monitoring performance, and utilizing these capacities to solve problems. Diathesis-stress hypothesis of schizophreniaSchizophrenia is a complex illness, and its possible causes are still subject of debate.However, according to a widely adopted view, both a biological predisposition, and exposure to environmental stress are necessary ingredients for schizophrenia to become manifest -the so-called diathesis stress model (Zubin & Spring, 1977).A classical example of the association between environmental stress and the risk of developing schizophrenia, comes from studies of the 1944-1945 Dutch Hunger Winter (Susser & Lin, 1992;Susser et al., 1996;Susser et al., 1998).In this discrete period during the Second World War, there was a serious decline in food intake in six cities of western Netherlands.Among people born in these cities between 1944 and 1946, the most exposed birth cohort (i.e., conceived at the height of the famine) showed a twofold and statistically significant increase in the risk for developing schizophrenia (Susser & Lin, 1992).Since this particular famine, many others occurred worldwide, but these were less suitable for epidemiological investigations due to more disorganized conditions (St Clair et al., 2005).However, several years after the Dutch Hunger Winter, a similar occasion occurred in China.Specifically, from 1959-1961, people in affected provinces were starving and died in large numbers due to bad weather (for refs see (St Clair et al., 2005)).Among births that occurred during the famine years, the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life was significantly increased when compared to those born before or afterwards (St Clair et al., 2005).These 'natural experiments' suggest that prenatal stress, i.e., exposure to maternal nutritional deficiency, could increase the risk of schizophrenia in later life.However, evidence from many observational studies that have investigated the association between experience of stress in adulthood and acute onset of psychotic illness, has not been confirmative (Phillips et al., 2007).In particular, there is no consistent evidence that experience of stressful life events is able to trigger onset of psychosis.Findings from longitudinal studies on the other hand, are stronger in linking episodes of relapse in schizophrenia patients to an elevated rate of stressful life events (Phillips et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2008), thus providing additional evidence for a role of stress exposure in (the course of) schizophrenia.

As a rule, acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) lasts up to 14 days [6]. Withdrawal symptoms extending beyond this period have been inconsistently described and have been attributed to adaptations within the central GABAergic, glutamatergic and catecholaminergic systems [1] [7]. There has been no clear delineation between acute and protracted withdrawal syndrome due to a lack of studies, therefore the concept of PAWS has not been included in the DSM-IV and the ICD-10 [8]. Physicians in detoxification units are very famililar with the protracted withdrawal states of restlessness, anxiety, hyperhydrosis, insomnia, dysphoria, tremor and vegetative complaints. These often reappear in the course of a careful tapering of withdrawal medications which had been initially beneficial.",

      "abstract": "The recognition of functional gastrointestinal diseases depends essentially on certain positive features characteristic of them. When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

Cocaine-induced excited delirium refers to fatal cocaine intoxication with the following symptoms occurring sequentially: hyperthermia, delirium with agitation, respiratory arrest, and death. We present a case of cocaine-induced excited delirium in a cocaine \"body packer\" or a \"mule\", specifically an individual who attempts to smuggle cocaine within the body. Investigators at the scene initially suspected homicide due to the victim's sharp and blunt force injuries. Three rubber packets containing cocaine were removed from the victim's rectum. Blood toxicological analysis revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.016 g/100 and cocaine >1 mg/L. The forensic pathologist should consider cocaine-induced excited delirium when an individual exhibits aggressive behavior, unexpected strength, and resistance to pain who dies suddenly. Further analysis should be performed during the scene investigation and autopsy for evidence of body packing.",

However, outcome after discontinuation of antidepressants is unfavourably affected by the duration of their administration. Loss of clinical effects, despite adequate compliance, has also emerged as a vexing clinical problem. Use of intermittent pharmacotherapy with follow-up visits is another therapeutic option, that, however, entails the problems of resistance and of discontinuation syndromes. In recent years, several controlled trials have suggested that a sequential use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode and psychotherapy in its residual phase may improve long-term outcome. Antidepressant drugs may be tapered and discontinued during the course of psychotherapy. The sequential treatment of depression not fall within the realm of maintenance strategies. It is an intensive, two-stage approach, which is based on the fact that one course of treatment with a specific tool (whether pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy) is unlikely to provide solution to the complex array of symptoms of patients with mood disorders.",

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "title": "Some implications of conditioning theory for problems of drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Viewing the development of drug cults as a conditioning process, examples are given of specific effects of alcohol, barbiturates, opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, marihuana, LSD and other psychotomimetic drugs that can reinforce continued use of the drug in question through facilitation of specific patterns of behavior that serve to gratify specific biological and socio-culturally generated human needs. It is hypothesized that, through repeated temporal contiguity between such primary reinforcement and the performance of rituals prescribed by those who are already members of the drug cult, novitiates eventually learn to perceive the magical drug-effects defined by the cult and to experience them even without benefit of the drug when the rituals are performed (secondary reinforcement), thereby becoming a new, full-fledged member of the cult. It is suggested that the maintenance of secondarily reinforced behavior in the absence of further programmed reinforcement by the drug is a consequence of previous classical conditioning of primary drug effects and possibly, of interoceptive conditioning. Some therapeutic applications of conditioning theory are indicated, with special reference to the possible use of specific drug antagonists to facilitate extinction of drug-seeking behavior. Expansion of basic psychopharmacological research as well as of educational and social ameliorative efforts are stressed as desiderata for eventual control of the problem of drug abuse.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents with psychoses usually have full recovery from their first psychotic episode, but the first relapse often arises within 2 years of the first episode. Cannabis-related psychoses are difficult to distinguish from schizophrenic psychoses. Here, we describe a particularly severe clinical case, with a first psychotic episode occurring after heavy cannabis smoking, an atypically long symptom-free duration, and a subsequent non-substance-related episode.A 17-year-old male adolescent of Middle-East origin presented with delusions and hallucinations after extensive cannabis smoking. His first psychotic episode, with paranoid delusions and hallucinations, progressed into severe catatonic symptoms. His symptoms were treated with electroconvulsive therapy and risperidone and he was transferred to a residential substance abuse treatment center. He remained drug-free and non-psychotic for 3.5 years. Given the temporal association with extensive cannabis use, and his full remission of symptoms lasting several years, a cannabis-induced psychosis-though atypically extended-could be suspected. However, after 3.5 years without psychiatric care, and in a drug-free state, our patient again presented with positive psychotic symptoms, possibly induced by a period of severe psychosocial stress.We here discuss whether a primary schizophrenic episode possibly induced by cannabis can increase the risk of subsequent non-drug-related schizophrenic episodes.",

On the other hand, epilepsy can be the cause of an additional disorder or the consequence of another health problem. Sometimes, epileptic seizures are the first sign of another condition or disease. This chapter will first focus on health problems that can be caused by epilepsy. The second part of the chapter describes other disorders or conditions that can cause epileptic seizures and epilepsy. When a medical disorder causes epileptic seizures, doctors do not always make a diagnosis of epilepsy. If people have seizures that were clearly provoked by another disorder (for instance, a low sodium level caused by diuretic medication—water tablets), treatment should involve the removal of the underlying cause of the seizures and not antiepileptic drugs. However, other medical conditions associated with epilepsy may not always be cured as easily, and people’s quality of life may then be affected by two chronic disorders.",

Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status.

Dans la depression, l'impact fonctionnel est majeur et genere des difficultes quant aux capacites de travail. Le concept de remission fonctionnelle a pris de l'importance dans notre societe ces dernieres annees. L'aptitude a la reprise de travail en fait partie. De nombreux facteurs peuvent influencer la remission fonctionnelle d'un episode depressif majeur en remission clinique partielle comme les symptomes cliniques residuels de la depression (symptomatologie anxieuse, troubles du sommeil...), les comorbidites (psychiatriques / somatiques eventuelles), la prise d'un traitement antidepresseur, les evenements professionnels, les troubles cognitifs residuels de la depression (deficit des fonctions executives, deficits attentionnels, ralentissement psychomoteur). Ce travail a explore l'Influence de la Cognition Sociale et plus specifiquement de la Theorie de l'Esprit sur la remission fonctionnelle de la depression et l'aptitude professionnelle, au travers d'une etude comparative de 30 patients en remission partielle d'un episode depressif majeur, repartis en deux groupes en fonction de leur statut professionnel. Nous avons constate dans ce travail, un deficit en Theorie de l'Esprit plus marque (a l'aide de l'epreuve des Faux Pas et de la tâche d'interpretation des regards) chez les patients n'ayant pas d'activite professionnelle et nous pouvons envisager qu'un deficit en Theorie de l'Esprit pourrait etre un facteur de mauvaise remission fonctionnelle et par consequent avoir une influence deletere sur le retour a l'emploi.",

Attacks can occur during stressful periods, exertion, or with emotional circumstances, as long as some other aggravators such as immersion into cold water, and sexual intercourse [2]. Cognitive functions other than memory, specifically self-awareness, are spared [3]. Marijuana use has been linked to transient global amnesia in some cases [4-6], presumably through the effect of Δ9- Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the Cannabinoid receptors (CB1) that are located presynaptically in the lipid membranes of neurons, which results in neuromodulation with changing the number of neurochemicals such as glutamergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic systems, all of which end up affecting the memory [7].",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

These behaviors include patients' \"eating, driving, making phone calls, and having sex while under the influence of sleep medications.\"Fugue-like behavior secondary to an organic condition, such as the effects of sleep medication, has no suitable category in the DSM classification system. DSM's \"dissociative fugue,\" for example, is \"not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy).\" In contrast, substance-induced disorders and those due to a general medical condition, as well as delirium, do not include as a central feature the apparently purposive and possibly complex or elaborate behavior seen in the kinds of cases reported in the Psychiatric News article on sleep medications and other reports over the years I have written.I have previously proposed that DSM include a diagnostic category for such cases of what could be called \"organic dissociation\" or\" dissociation secondary to a general medical or substance-induced condition.\" Such a category would also help classify automatisms that can be observed in conditions like temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative-like states due to other medical factors that presently have no fitting DSM category. Not only would this category improve diagnostic precision and permit possibly greater study of these states, but also it would provide recognition of varying degrees of contribution from psychological, general medical, substance-induced, and stress-related factors, as opposed to requiring that the dissociative-like behaviors be \"due to\" either an organic condition alone or have no organic contribution. The dissociative-like behaviors seen in these states generally do not have an either-or etiology but rather are the expression of several determinants.Chestnut Hill, Mass. ISSUES NewArchived",

      "title": "Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Psychotherapy and Psychosocial Interventions in the Medically Ill",
      "abstract": "Patients with medical diseases and somatizing behaviors, as well as psychological symptoms accompanying various chronic medical illnesses, are notoriously difficult to treat. These patients frequently hold negative views of both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The concept of treating their mostly unexplained symptoms with medication may be associated with various preconceived negative ideas, such as introducing a 'foreign' substance to the body, or simply lack of acceptance of using psychotropic medication for 'clearly somatic' symptoms/illnesses. In addition, the risks of side effects and drug-drug interactions are frequently increased in this population. Psychotherapy may not be accepted well among these patients, either. As Schweickhardt et al. [1] reminded us recently, patients with somatizing behavior 'by definition have no psychological attribution to the symptoms', and thus treatment acceptance and motivation for psychotherapy is low. Another factor complicating the use of psychotherapy and its outcome in this population is alexithymia. Various studies demonstrated the possible negative effects of alexithymia on therapy outcome [e.g. [2, 3]], though some studies did not [4].Nevertheless, the vague character of the symptomatology of these disorders, the associated distress, and the aforementioned possible increased sensitivity/incidence of side effects and drug interactions of psychotropic medications make various therapies a clinically preferable option in the treatment of medical illnesses that are considered to be psychosomatic, somatization and associated symptoms of chronic medical illnesses. Psychotherapies, rather than a strictly pharmacotherapeutic approach, may be more attuned to carefully assessing the complex host of factors affecting individual vulnerability (e.g. life events, allostatic load, psychological well-being) and psychosocial correlates of medical illness discussed by Fava and Sonino [5]. The relationship between some so-called psychosomatic disorders and psychosocial factors could be bi-directional. A recent review and meta-analysis [6] exhibited a positive association between psychosocial factors and future atopic disorders, as well as between atopic disorders and future poor mental health. The authors of this analysis also noted that psychosocial factors had both etiological and prognostic effects on atopic disorders, and suggested that psychological interventions should be used in addition to conventional physical and pharmacological interventions in these disorders [6]. There also seems to be increasing evidence for efficacy and usefulness of at least 1 therapy – cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) – in somatoform disorders and medically unexplained symptoms. The review by Sumathipala [7] concluded that CBT is efficacious for either symptom syndromes or for the broader category of medically unexplained symptoms, and also for reducing psychological distress and disability. CBT seems to be effective in reduction of a wide range of physical symptoms, associated mood disturbance, as well as improving overall and physical functioning. Sumathipala [7] actually reviewed the evidence for the efficacy of 2 other interventions – antidepressants and other nonspecific intervention. The evidence for the efficacy of CBT was the strongest, though no study compared pharmacological and psychological treatments. In a similar review of randomized controlled trials, Kroenke [8] concluded that CBT is the best established treatment of a variety of somatoform disorders.Several recent studies examined the role of mostly behavioral or cognitive-behavioral approaches to the treatment of so-called psychosomatic disorders or psychological symptoms of physical illness. Goebel et al. [9] investigated whether the effects of desloratidine, a nonsedating histamine 1 receptor antagonist, can be behaviorally conditioned in patients with allergic house dust mite rhinitis. The authors used a behavioral conditioning procedure. They demonstrated that, in their small sample, behaviorally conditioned effects were not only able to relieve subjective rhinitis symptoms and allergic skin reactions, but also to induce changes in effector immune functions, e.g. basophil activation. As the authors suggest, behavioral conditioning might be utilized as a supplement to immunomodulatory drug regimes to decrease the dose of medication. Lolak et al. [10] found that progressive muscle relaxation added to standard pulmonary rehabilitation significantly reduced anxiety and depression in patients with chronic breathing disorders. These results suggest that adding a behavioral technique to the management of physical illness, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may reduce the need for adding medications for psychological symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. In an interesting study from China, Wang et al. [11] found that psychological intervention – here defined as psychotherapy that included encouragement, verbal suggestion, relaxation training (RT), distraction with verbal communication about interests of the patients, therapeutically touching the faces of the patients, guided imagery and intra-arterial placebo – significantly reduced pain scores during hepatic arterial chemoembolization therapy of hepatic malignancies. Furthermore, van Kessel et al. [12] studied the efficacy of CBT and RT in multiple-sclerosis-related fatigue. Both CBT and RT were clinically effective, but the effects of CBT were greater than those of RT. Interestingly, even 6 months after treatment, patients in both CBT and RT groups reported fatigue levels equivalent to those of the healthy comparison group.Some seem to believe that CBT could also work 'per proxy'. It has been suggested that parents should be the main agents of change in treatment of childhood obesity [e.g. [13]]. Thus, Munsch et al. [14] conducted an interesting study in childhood obesity. Obese children (age 8–12 years) and their families were randomly assigned to a 16-session CBT for the mothers only (children in this group attended progressive muscle relaxation training of equal frequency and duration to the disorder-specific CBT in the other group) or CBT for both parents and children. Both treatments reduced children's overweight percentage significantly and equally at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments also similarly reduced behavioral problems, anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, the design of this study did not allow them to determine whether CBT in parents only ('per proxy') works better than CBT in both parents and children – the use of progressive muscle relaxation confounded the results.A recent review article [15] also suggested that there is good evidence that hypnotherapy benefits many patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a condition where medication use could be especially difficult. In addition to its psychological effects, hypnotherapy may modulate gastrointestinal physiology and even influence immune function. Nevertheless, Whorwell [15] felt that hypnotherapy should be a part of an integrated approach to the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and not used as a 'stand alone' treatment. Similarly, Fried and Hussain [16] reviewed the evidence of the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions in psychocutaneous disorders, defined in 3 broad categories: (1) skin conditions associated with a primary psychiatric diagnosis; (2) dual psychiatric-dermatological diagnosis such lichen simplex chronicus or dermatitis artefacta; (3) skin conditions known to be elicited or worsened by emotional factors such as rosacea, acne, psoriasis, alopecia areata. Fried and Hussain [15] felt, based on their review of the literature, that interventions such as hypnosis, support groups, biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation, various forms of psychotherapy (interpersonal, CBT), massage and physician support and reassurance could be of substantial help in various psychocutaneous disorders.The evidence for the usefulness of various forms of psychotherapy (especially CBT) and other psychosocial interventions in medical diseases, somatoform or so-called psychosomatic disorders and psychological symptoms accompanying physical illnesses keeps growing. The next steps in research should probably involve attempts to develop either manuals of various therapies (mostly CBT) for particular disorders, or at least identification of more specific guidance and possible limiting factors. Another venue of research in this area should focus on a possible positive effect of psychotherapeutic techniques on the reduction of sympathetic arousal in individuals with these disorders, as suggested by Conrad et al. [17]. These authors also suggested that techniques such as autogenic relaxation or a modified form of expressive writing might prove to be economical therapy options leading to reduction of sympathetic arousal, even in patients with ocular disease such as central serous chorioretinopathy [17].Some of the factors limiting the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in medical diseases (so-called psychosomatic disorders) and/or psychological factors accompanying physical illness (such as alexithymia [2, 3, 17]) or limiting participation in psychosocial interventions (such as low level distress, lower socioeconomic class and adaptive coping [18]) have been identified. Some of the interventions – e.g. the short-term psychotherapeutic intervention for somatizing patients in general hospitals prior to referral for outpatient psychosocial intervention suggested by Schweickhardt et al. [1] – could probably be used uniformly.As North et al. [19] suggested in the case of irritable bowel syndrome, no single mode of treatment is likely to be universally effective or help resolve all symptoms. Combinations with medications, or even behavioral conditioning for some medication effects, may be useful. Nevertheless, psychotherapy and other psychosocial interventions seem to become a more obvious choice in the management of so-called psychosomatic disorders and/or psychological symptoms of medical illness, either alone or as an augmentation of other treatments. At the present time, the most useful and best evaluated form among various psychotherapy/psychosocial interventions for these conditions is CBT.Fava et al. [e.g., [20]] have been proposing a sequential treatment approach to mood and anxiety disorders. Maybe a similar sequential paradigm – the short-term preparatory psychotherapeutic intervention proposed by Schweickhardt et al. [1] and/or motivational interviewing, followed by psychotherapy (CBT), behavioral conditioning for medication and finally medication itself – could be tested for treatment of some medical diseases, so-called psychosomatic disorders and/or psychological symptoms of medical illness. Interestingly, motivational interviewing has been used, in addition to the management of alcohol and other substance abuses, in the management of eating and weight disorders either alone [21] or in combination with CBT [22], chronic heart failure [23] and in health coaching [24].Several studies mentioned in this article were supported by various national and other foundations; however, none of the cited studies, to my knowledge, was supported by the pharmaceutical industry.",

This leads to a serious decrease in quality of life in patient and their caregivers and it can precipitate the institutionalization. Non-pharmacological therapies are of increasing importance, particularly in therapeutic options. The aim is to gain knowledge about these symptoms, the therapies mentioned above, their utility as well as to identify nursing interventions, through published literature review. In addition to cognitive deterioration other type of symptoms such as apathy, depression, agitation, aggressiveness and anxiety can appear in any stage of illness. Their frequency and intensity tend to increase as the disease progresses. Severe adverse effects associated with some medicines have given rise to non-pharmacological therapies which have been developed in recent years. Moreover, they contribute to some characteristics which are of undoubted interest to, such as no side effects. In addition to this they allow to give individualized treatment. The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) includes interventions that are in accordance with the therapies mentioned within the context of multidisciplinary team working. They are targeted at patient, as well as family members and caregivers.",

Several potent bioactive compounds with neuroprotective potential have been reported from medicinal plants and some of them have been found to be highly effective. Belonging from natural sources, mostly, the plant derived compounds exhibit minimum or no cytotoxicity at a prescribed standardised dose against a particular health ailment. Many such phytocompounds from plant sources with potent neuroprotective activities have been in use in Ayurvedacharya, Unani, and Chinese medicine for ages. The compounds if isolated chemically, modified to make more potent neuroprotective derivatives and utilised to make highly effective neuroprotective pharmaceutical formulations with minimum side effects, may open new revolutionary doorways in neuropharmacology.

      "title": "Drug-induced dystonia",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced dystonia (DID) is a rarely diagnosed adverse reaction to a sufficiently large number of drugs. Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

      "title": "Severe Localized Pain Associated with the Depressive Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Depressive illness is protean in its manifestations. The symptoms may be primarily psychological, such as misery, indecisiveness, irritability, inability to concentrate, or insomnia. They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one. In spite of thorough investigation, there will remain a proportion of patients in whom no lesion can be found to account for their symptoms.",

      "title": "Drug-Induced Psychosis Associated with Crystalline Methamphetamine",
      "abstract": "Objective: A case of drug-induced psychosis related to crystalline meth amphetamine is described, highlighting the phenomenology and relevant treatment. Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of peripartum depression are the same as those of major depressive disorder, and include depressed mood, insomnia, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, guilt, worthlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, change in appetite, and change in motor activity. Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "title": "高齢者における急性薬物中毒の現状(Present status of acute medication intoxication in elderly)",
      "abstract": "【背景と目的】高齢者は，内服薬の種類が多いことや自己管理が困難になることがあり，定期処方の薬剤でも薬物中毒を引き起こし得る。今回，高齢者の急性薬物中毒の傾向について検討した。【対象と方法】2009年1月1日から2013年12月31日までの過去5年間に，当院救急外来で急性薬物中毒と診断した65歳以上の症例を対象とした。薬物依存症，診断が疑いの場合は，対象から除外した。自殺目的や誤ってなどで自ら過量服薬した故意的要素か，偶発的な事故的要素か，原因薬剤，主訴，転帰などを調査した。【結果】65歳以上の急性薬物中毒の総数は72例。84歳以下では故意による過量服薬が多かったが，超高齢者では定期内服による事故要素が多かった。原因薬物は，ベンゾジアゼピン系睡眠薬42例，フェノバルビタール8例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬もしくはβ遮断薬4例，テオフィリン2例，抗うつ薬2例，サリチル酸1例，アシクロビル1例であった。主訴は意識障害が35例と最も多く，ショックを伴っていたのは8例で，家族や施設職員などにより発見されていた。【結語】高齢であるほど故意による薬物中毒は少なく，定期内服による中毒が多かった。高齢者では腎機能障害を有している例が多いと考えられ，抗てんかん薬，ジギタリスを含む抗不整脈薬，降圧薬の作用増強・遷延が起こりやすい。 Background: In elderly people, drug intoxication in regular prescription setting, can be caused by too many kinds of oral medicines and with the difficulty in self–administration. We researched on the tendency of acute drug intoxication in elderly people. Methods: Patient over 65 years old who have been diagnosed acute drug intoxication at emergency department in our hospital last 5 years from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013 were included. We investigated on the cause, either intentional factors like suicide and overdose medication or contingent accident factors, offending drugs, chief complaint, living conditions and outcomes. Those who had suspected diagnosis or drug dependence case were excluded. Results: There were 72 cases of acute drug intoxication. In patients under 84 years old mostly overdosed intentionally, but on the other hand, in patients 85 years old or more had more accidental factor by taking drugs regularly. The offending drugs were benzodiazepine 42 cases, phenobarbital 8 cases, digitalis 8 cases, phenytoin 4 cases, calcium antagonist 4 cases, theophylline 2 cases, antidepressant 2 cases, salicylated 1 case, and acyclovir 1 case. The chief complaints were impaired consciousness in 35 cases which were the most, and 8 cases were in shock, which were found by family or facility workers. Conclusions: The higher the age is, the fewer intentional drug intoxication, and we have to consider there are many cases that have renal dysfunction in the elderly. 高齢者は，基礎疾患の多様性により多種類の併用薬剤や複数の医療機関受診による整理困難な内服処方を受けている場合が多い。その結果，定期処方であっても，自己管理が困難であることや，薬物代謝の加齢変化などが誘因となり，薬物有害事象が発生する。外来患者や介護施設でも高齢者の10%以上に薬物有害事象が見られ 1，高齢者入院の1.5%がこのような薬物有害事象による入院と報告 2されている。そこで，救急外来における高齢者の急性薬物中毒の傾向を調査し，高齢者診療における注意点を考察した。 また，本研究のヒトを対象とした研究にあたっては，Helsinki人権宣言に基づく倫理規定を遵守した。 対象は2009年1月1日から2013年12月31日までの過去5年間に，当院救急外来を受診し急性薬物中毒と診断された65歳以上の症例である。血糖降下薬，抗血小板薬，抗凝固薬が関連したと思われる症例，薬物依存症，中毒診断が疑いの場合，また毒劇物，農薬，アルコールなど医薬品以外の中毒は対象から除外した。カルテ記載を調査した後ろ向き研究であり，年齢階級別に65歳から74歳までの前期高齢者，75歳から84歳までの後期高齢者，85歳以上の超高齢者に分けて調査した。調査項目は，故意か事故か，主訴，生活背景（日常生活動作，居住環境），原因薬剤，転帰，腎機能とした。故意か事故かの判断については，正しい量を内服しているにもかかわらず，血中濃度が中毒域になり臨床症状が出現しているものを事故とし，それ以外の自殺企図目的やより効果を求めて過量服用したものは故意と区別した。また，認知機能低下などによる誤服用については正しい服用方法ではないため，今回の検討では故意に分類した。また，腎機能の指標となる糸球体濾過量（glomerular filtration rate: GFR）は，日本腎臓病学会（2008年）で報告されたものに基づいて，男性の場合はeGFR（mL/分/1.73m2）=194×Cr−1.094×年齢−0.287，女性の場合はeGFR（mL/分/1.73m2）=194×Cr−1.094×年齢−0.287×0.739で算出した。 統計はJMP®11.2.0を使用し，年齢階級別の解析はカイ2乗検定，one–way ANOVAで行い，有意水準は0.05未満とした。 過去5年間の65歳以上の急性薬物中毒の総数は72例，そのうち前期高齢者は31例，後期高齢者は30例，超高齢者は11例であった。主な調査項目の結果をTable 1に示す。年齢中央値は77.0歳，最少年齢65歳，最高年齢95歳，男性28例，女子44例であった。救急車による緊急搬送は50例（69.4%）で，85歳以上では11例全例が救急搬送であり，年齢群別で有意差を認めた（p<0.05）。自殺目的や誤ってなどで自ら過量服薬した故意的要素の症例は40例，偶発的な事故症例は32例であった。前期高齢者では，故意的症例が74.2%と多かったが，超高齢者では事故的症例が72.7%と，高齢になればなるほど事故的要素が有意に増加していた（p<0.05）。

生活背景としては，まず日常生活動作が自立している人は55例，杖歩行や車いす使用が12例，部分介助や寝たきりは5例であった。主に薬剤管理している者は，本人が65例，家族4例，誰が管理しているか不明であったものは4例と，患者自身で内服管理している症例が90.3%と多かった。居住状況は，独居22例，家族と同居44例，施設入居2例，不明4例と家族と同居している症例が61%と最も多かったが，独居も約30.6%を占めていた。定期内服種類数は，前期高齢者4.0種類，後期高齢者5.0種類，超高齢者7.5種類と，高齢になるほど有意に定期内服薬の種類数が多かった（p<0.05）。 主訴は，意識障害35例，脱力11例，ショック8例，傾眠7例，倦怠感7例，心停止，嘔気，食欲低下，焦燥感，特にないというのが各1例と，非特異的な症状であった。 中毒の原因となった薬剤は，ベンゾジアゼピン系などの睡眠薬42例，フェノバルビタール系薬剤8例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬やβ遮断薬が4例，三環系抗うつ薬2例，テオフィリン2例，サリチル酸1例，抗ウイルス薬1例であった。 治療は，経過観察および薬剤中止のみによる自然軽快が64例，ベンゾジアゼピン中毒に対する拮抗薬物の使用3例，アシクロビル中毒やテオフィリン中毒に対する血液透析2例，ジギタリス中毒に対する一時的ペースメーカー留置2例，三環系抗うつ薬中毒に対する心肺蘇生法1例であった。転帰は，入院44例，帰宅28例であり，入院日数の中央値は前期高齢者で3.0日，後期高齢者で4.0日，超高齢者で4.5日であった（p=0.71）。 次に，事故的要素で薬物中毒となった32例の特徴をTable 2に示す。全体での結果と同様に，高齢になるほど定期内服薬の種類数が多いことに有意差を認めたが，それ以外の項目では有意差を認めなかった。生活背景では，日常生活動作が自立している人は20例（62.5%）と多く，主に薬剤管理しているのが本人である症例は28例（87.5%）であった。居住状況は，独居7例，家族と同居22例，施設入居1例，不明2例と家族と同居している症例が最も多かった。事故的症例の独居者の主訴は，本人が嘔気や傾眠を自覚し救急搬送しているものが5例，ヘルパーなどの介護者に倒れているのを発見された意識障害症例は2例であった。中毒の原因となった薬剤は，ベンゾジアゼピン系などの睡眠薬9例，フェノバルビタール系薬剤2例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬やβ遮断薬が4例，三環系抗うつ薬1例，テオフィリン2例，サリチル酸1例，抗ウイルス薬1例であり，基礎疾患関連の循環器系薬剤の影響が多かった。また，相互作用を起こす内服薬は27例処方されており，その相互作用が今回の主訴と関連した症例は17例であった。2週間前に抗てんかん薬が新規追加された症例，向精神薬やカルシウム拮抗薬が数日前から増量された症例，定期内服が頻回に変更されている症例，各専門診療科受診で非ステロイド性抗炎症薬などが新規追加された症例を認めた。

3。本邦の調査でも，一般病院の入院症例では60歳未満に比べて70歳以上では1.5倍以上の薬物有害事象出現率を示し，高齢者の6～15%に薬物有害事象を認めたとされている 4, 5。その原因として，高齢者においては基礎疾患および年齢に伴う薬物代謝の変化を背景とした“薬の効き過ぎ”と多剤併用（polypharmacy）が重要と認識され，老年病専門医においては，93%で薬物有害事象の予防目的に薬剤を減量・中止することがあると報告 6されている。本検討でも，高齢者の薬物中毒は少なからず認められ，高齢になるほど故意での過量服用より事故要素の薬物中毒が多かった。これは決められた量の処方薬を飲んでいるだけにもかかわらず，血中濃度が高値になってしまう場合であり，今回この事故的要素の薬物中毒に焦点をあて，誘因を調査し，薬物側因子と患者側因子に分けた。まず薬物側因子では高齢になるほど定期内服薬の種類および数が多くなること，基礎疾患に対する処方薬が増えるため定期内服薬自体に相互作用を起こすものが多くなること，新たな疾患に対して各専門診療科でそれぞれ新規薬剤が追加されること，有効血中濃度域と中毒域が比較的狭い薬剤の使用が多いことが挙げられる。患者側因子は，年齢とともに徐々に肝機能や心機能，腎機能が低下してくること，発熱や経口摂取不良により脱水になりやすいこと，骨密度低下による筋骨格系の受診歴が増加し非ステロイド性抗炎症剤などの鎮痛剤使用があること，これらの相互的作用によりさらなる腎機能障害が出現することである。また，薬物側因子と患者側因子が重複した場合，決められた量や種類を誤って服用したりすることで，少量の薬剤でも重篤な症状となり得る。 高齢者の薬剤有害事象を未然に防ぐ処方基準として欧米ではBeers criteria 7, 8が広く知られている。65歳以上の高齢患者を対象として，「高齢患者において疾患・病態によらず一般に使用を避けることが望ましい薬剤」と「高齢患者における特定の疾患・病態において使用を避けることが望ましい薬剤」が載っており，その日本版 9も呈示されている。しかしながら，Beers criteriaに挙げられている一般不適切薬よりも，ワーファリン，インスリンといった薬のほうが，有害事象による救急医療を要する割合が約35倍にも上るという報告 10もあり，その問題点が指摘されている。我が国における薬物有害事象を未然に防ぐ取り組みとしては，医薬分業制度があり，薬剤師が介入することにより患者の服薬管理が整えば，複数の医療機関からの重複投薬をチェックでき，副作用の防止につながる。この制度は2003年に初めて全国の医薬分業率（外来で処方箋を受け取った患者のうち，院外の薬局で調剤を受けた割合）が50%を超えており，今後もさらなる拡大が望まれる。また本検討では，原因薬剤は睡眠薬系が最も多かったが，循環器系や抗てんかん薬など基礎疾患関連の薬剤，特に事故症例に限定すると循環器系薬剤の影響が多く，より重篤な症状を呈し治療介入を要していた。このような重篤な有害事象が起こっていることを，日々病診連携で情報提供しあうことが大切である。 その他の結果として，若年者より総数は少ないが，自殺目的による薬物過量服用は高齢者でも散見されること，認知機能の低下により内服薬の種類や量を誤って服用してしまう症例があった。 救急臨床現場では，本人からの情報聴取が困難な場合や現場状況の情報がない場合に意識障害やショック，脱力などの原因として薬物中毒も鑑別に挙げなければならない。特に重篤となるのは，尿中薬物スクリーニングキットで検出可能な睡眠薬や抗うつ薬よりも，検出されない循環器系薬剤や抗てんかん薬であり，独居高齢者の死亡の原因になり得る。 本論文の全著者に，規定されたCOIはない。

Thestuporose phase is characterised by increased muscular tension, or in some instances catalepsy, together with negativism, mutism, refusal of food, contrary acts, or not infrequently an increased suggestibility, as shown by echolalia or echopraxia. The prominent features of katatonic excitement are increased psycho-motor activity, attitudinizing, stereotyped movements and phrases, verbigeration, and senseless impulses. Various forms of convulsive attacks are motor phenomena which frequently occur during the course of the psychosis.",

      "title": "Addressing the unmet needs of patients with persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia: emerging pharmacological treatment options",
      "abstract": "Abstract: The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an impairment of normal emotional responses, thought processes and behaviors, and include blunting or flattening of affect, alogia/aprosody, avolition/apathy, anhedonia, and asociality. Negative symptoms contribute to a reduced quality of life, increased functional disability, increased burden of illness, and poorer long-term outcomes, to a greater degree than positive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are prominent and persistent in up to 26% of patients with schizophrenia, and they are estimated to occur in up to 58% of outpatients at any given time. Negative symptoms respond less well to medications than positive symptoms, and to date treatment options for negative symptoms have been limited, with no accepted standard treatment. Modest benefits have been reported with a variety of different agents, including second-generation antipsychotics and add-on therapy with antidepressants and other pharmacological classes. Recent clinical research focusing on negative symptoms target novel biological systems, such as glutamatergic neurotransmission. Different approaches include: enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function with agents that bind directly to the glycine ligand site or with glycine reuptake inhibitors; influencing the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) with positive allosteric modulators; and stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In conclusion, the lack of clearly efficacious pharmacological treatments for the management of negative symptoms represents a significant unmet need, especially considering the importance of these symptoms on patient outcomes. Hence, further research to identify and characterize novel pharmacological treatments for negative symptoms is greatly needed. Keywords: negative symptoms, schizophrenia, NMDA receptor, glycine reuptake inhibitors, metabotropic glutamate receptor-2 (mGluR2), 7-alpha nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists",

An intimate link between pain, mood, and sleep is apparent. Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions.

PTSD is associated with family and relational distress; social, educational, and occupational impairment; comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions; and high economic costs and medical utilization.

      "abstract": "Sexuality in dementia is infrequently addressed. Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in all domains of functioning, including loss of sexual function. However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa sedacion paliativa se define como la disminucion deliberada del nivel de conciencia del enfermo mediante la administracion de los farmacos apropiados con el objeto de evitar un sufrimiento intenso causado por uno o mas sintomas refractarios; la sedacion en la agonia se asume como continua y tan profunda como sea necesario. La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

      "abstract": "Most extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptics are easily recognized and cause little problem in diagnosis and treatment. The exceptions are those which mimic psychopathology: akathesia and akinisia. Akathesia resembles anxiety. Akinesia is similar to depression, residual schizophrenia, and demoralization. Differential diagnosis may require interruption of the neuroleptic. Whether neuroleptics can cause depression not associated with akinesia has never been established. The first obligation of the clinician is to be sure that the depressive symptoms are not concomitants of akinesia, before treating with antidepressants which may not be the appropriate treatment. There is no convincing evidence that one neuroleptic drug is more likely to cause akinesia than another, although this had not been studied extensively using a broad definition of akinesia.",

Delirium can be precipitated by any somatic factor, which includes a variety of different illnesses, surgery, or substance (medication) intoxication or withdrawal. Predisposing factors are higher age and cognitive and functional impairment, among others. A final common pathway seems to be the most plausible for this multifactorial syndrome. The current leading candidate for the final pathway is the neurotransmitter state of relative acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess, together with an exaggerated inflammatory cascade. Although prevention of delirium should be the main aim, treatment consists of non-pharmacologic measures, reversing the precipitating conditions, and judicious use of antipsychotics in severely agitated patients only. Delirium is independently associated with an increase in mortality, impaired physical and cognitive recovery, and increased hospital costs.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Medical Emergencies Associated with Psychotropic Medications",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychotropic medications form an integral part of the management of various psychiatric disorders. However, psychotropic medications are associated with specific side effects, which can manifest as medical emergencies. Some of these side effects are rare, whereas some are relatively more common [Table 1]. Some of the medical emergencies arise due to the toxic doses of these medications. Some of these side effects are obvious (for example, acute dystonia and akathisia), and the association with the ongoing psychotropic medicines is easy to establish. If these medical emergencies are not identified in time and intervened, some side effects can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. However, for some of these side effects, a high index of suspicion is required, and there is a need to rule out other possible causes before attributing the side effect to the ongoing psychotropic medication.Table 1: Medical emergencies due to use of or overdose of psychotropic medicationsThis guideline provides an overview for evaluating patients presenting with medical emergencies due to the ongoing psychotropic medications or intake of psychotropics in overdose. It provides an overview of how to assess and manage patients presenting with these medical emergencies. These guidelines are not a substitute for clinical knowledge, and every patient presenting with these features will require individualized assessment and management. These guidelines are limited to the life-threatening medical emergencies for which a definite etiological association between psychotropics and medical emergencies is established, or the crisis is related to the overdose of the medication. We are aware of other life-threatening side effects of psychotropics that can present as medical emergencies. An association between these presentations and psychotropics is reported, but a definite causal association is not established. ACUTE DYSTONIAS Acute dystonia is characterized by sudden involuntary contraction of muscles resulting in repetitive or twisting movements. These are usually seen during the initial days of starting antipsychotic medications. This can manifest as focal dystonia (affecting only one part of the body) or generalized dystonia (involving all body parts). The dystonia can be painful to the sufferers. The antipsychotic-induced dystonia is defined as \"sustained abnormal postures or muscle spasms that develop within seven days of starting antipsychotics or while rapidly increasing the dose of the antipsychotic medication, or of reducing the medication used to treat (or prevent) acute extrapyramidal symptoms (i.e., removal of anticholinergic agents).\"[1] The literature has reported a vast prevalence range, varying from 2% to 90%.[2] The differential risk of acute dystonia with various antipsychotics is influenced by their differential dopamine–acetylcholine antagonism, with higher levels of dopamine–acetylcholine antagonism associated with greater chances of developing acute dystonia. It usually involves the neck muscles (cervical dystonia–torticollis) and manifests as head twisting/turning to one side, backward, or forward. Besides the neck muscles, the dystonias associated with the use of antipsychotics can affect the eyelids (manifest as blepharospasm), jaw (oromandibular dystonia manifesting as slurring of speech and drooling of saliva along with difficulty in chewing and swallowing), tongue (lingual dystonia), and laryngeal muscles (laryngeal dystonia, manifesting as difficulty in speaking). Sometimes, the hands or only the fingers may be involved. Rarely, the generalized form of acute dystonia may manifest as opisthotonus. Among the various forms, laryngeal dystonia can lead to striders and be life-threatening. Multiple risk factors have been identified for precipitation of acute dystonia associated with the use of antipsychotics [Table 2].[2]Table 2: Risk factors for the development of acute dystonias with antipsychotics[2]A specific type of dystonia that involves eye muscles, known as an oculogyric crisis, can occur when the patient is on a stable dose of antipsychotics. The various precipitating factors for oculogyric crisis include the use of alcohol, some emotional stress, fatigue, and suggestibility.[2] In almost all cases (95%), acute dystonia manifests within 4 days of starting an antipsychotics or after a significant increase in the dose of the antipsychotic.[2] Differential diagnosis In terms of differential diagnosis of acute dystonia induced by antipsychotics, the other medications which can cause acute dystonia must be considered, which can include metoclopramide.[2] Other differential diagnoses include dissociation, catatonia, tardive dystonia (usually seen after months to years of antipsychotic use and do not improve rapidly after the use of anticholinergic medications), temporal lobe epilepsy, which can lead to bizarre postures, and hypocalcemia. While establishing the diagnosis of antipsychotic-associated acute dystonia, the possibility of dystonia related to other medications [Table 3] and substance of abuse must also be kept in mind, as often antipsychotics are prescribed along with other concomitant agents and patients with mental illness also have a high prevalence of substance abuse.Table 3: Medications and substances other than antipsychotics which have also been reported to cause acute dystonia[2]Management Acute dystonia is an acute emergency that requires immediate intervention. Occurrence of dystonia can disrupt the therapeutic alliance. The management of acute dystonia involves the intramuscular or intravenous administration of an anticholinergic medication or an antihistaminic agent [Table 4]. Usually, the symptoms resolve within 15–20 min. Most patients respond to the first dose of the injectable medication, with only very few patients requiring repetition of the second or third dose of drugs. However, suppose a patient does not respond to two doses of medication. In that case, a change in the medication should be considered. If this does not lead to the desired result, then a diagnosis other than acute dystonia associated with antipsychotics should be considered.Table 4: Stepwise management of antipsychotic-associated acute dystoniaOnce the acute dystonia is managed with various agents, it is recommended to continue anticholinergic agents for at least 24–48 h to avoid recurrence of acute dystonia. However, in routine clinical practice, the anticholinergic agents are continued up to 4–7 days. In routine clinical practice, some clinicians prefer to use prophylactic anticholinergic agents rather than allowing acute dystonia to emerge. However, everyday use of anticholinergic agents is not recommended. The use of the prophylactic anticholinergic agents should consider the risk factors for the development of acute dystonia, type and dose of antipsychotic use, and the concomitant medications.[2] AKATHISIA The term akathisia is derived from Greek and means \"inability to sit.\" It is characterized by a subjective feeling of inner restlessness and objective restlessness, as observed by others. A sense of dysphoria usually accompanies it and the patient complains of a mounting tension when he/she tries to remain still. In terms of objective evidence, the patient would appear to have difficulty sitting/standing/lying at one place for a long time. Acute akathisia is usually seen during the initial few hours or days of starting antipsychotics. The risk for developing acute akathisia is high in patients receiving antipsychotics for the first time, rapid escalation of antipsychotic doses, and polypharmacy with antipsychotics. Different types of akathisia described in the literature include: Acute akathisia Chronic akathisia (akathisia lasting for at least 3 months) Withdrawal akathisia (seen within 6 weeks of reduction in the dose or stopping of antipsychotics) Tardive akathisia (seen after a long duration of use of antipsychotics). These must be considered in the differential diagnosis before the diagnosis of acute akathisia is made. Management The first step in managing akathisia involves proper assessment to confirm the diagnosis of akathisia. Assessment of akathisia consists in taking a good history and carrying out a physical examination to distinguish different types of akathisia and ruling out the other differential diagnoses [Table 5]. Akathisia is also associated with a high risk of suicidal behavior. Hence, patients with akathisia should also be appropriately evaluated for suicidality. A commonly used scale to assess subjective and objective aspects of akathisia includes Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS). It is recommended that BARS should be used before starting or increasing the dose of antipsychotics.Table 5: Differential diagnosis of akathisiaThe treatment of akathisia involves a reduction in the dose of an offending antipsychotic agent or changing to another antipsychotic with a lower propensity to cause akathisia (low-potency first-generation antipsychotic or a second antipsychotic medication, like quetiapine). Other options include the use of anti-akathisia medications. The various options include beta-blockers, 5HT2A receptor antagonists, anticholinergic agents, dopamine agonists, GABAergic agents, benzodiazepines, and Vitamin B6 [Table 6]. Beta-blockers are usually considered the first-line and gold standard agent for the management of akathisia. However, it is important to remember that beta-blockers cannot be used in all patients. Some of the contraindications for the use of beta-blockers include hypotension, bradycardia, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and cardiac conduction defects. In such a situation, mirtazapine, which is a 5HT2A receptor antagonist, is considered to be an alternative first-line agent. The second alternative medication includes Vitamin B6.[34]Table 6: Management of akathisiaNEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME, SEROTONIN SYNDROME, AND ANTICHOLINERGIC SYNDROME Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Various psychotropics can lead to life-threatening side effects, which have a typical clinical picture. These patients can present with neurological manifestations in rigidity, change in reflex response, and altered sensorium. Reviewing the history of medication intake, proper physical examination, and carrying out appropriate investigations are helpful clues to the diagnosis. These side effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndrome. If these syndromes are not recognized in time and managed appropriately, these can be life-threatening. NMS is a rare but life-threatening idiosyncratic side effect of antipsychotic medications. It has been reported with almost all antipsychotic drugs. Besides antipsychotics, NMS has also been reported with other medications such as mood stabilizers and metoclopramide. The incidence rate of NMS has varied across different studies and is influenced by various methodological issues. The available data suggest an incidence rate of 0.02%–3.23%.[56] The typical picture of NMS is characterized by fever, rigidity, altered sensorium, and autonomic disturbances.[7] Various risk factors have been identified for the development of NMS [Table 7]. In terms of etiology, different etiological mechanisms have been suggested, with one of the most accepted hypotheses suggesting the clinical picture of NMS to be an outcome of dopaminergic antagonism at the D2 receptors in the central nervous system, which triggers a cascade that impairs the thermoregulatory response of the body, which degrades the dissipation of heat and increased production of heat in the body.[89]Table 7: Risk factors for neuroleptic malignant syndrome[8 9 10 11 12 13]Clinical features The clinical features of NMS are usually seen during the initial few days after starting antipsychotic medications. Majority of the patients who develop NMS do so within 10 days of starting antipsychotic, with almost all cases beginning within 30 days of beginning antipsychotics.[9] However, this should not be understood as NMS cannot occur after this time frame. The typical picture of NMS is characterized by fever, rigidity (lead pipe), altered sensorium, and autonomic disturbances (increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, excessive sweating, sustained or labile hypertension, and hypersalivation). Some of the authors have tried to define the evolution of NMS in five stages, with stage 5 being the most severe form characterized by extreme lead pipe rigidity, heart rate in the range of 130–150 beats per min, systolic blood pressure ranging from 140 to 210 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ranging from 100 to 110 mmHg, and body temperature in the range of 39°C–42°C, accompanied by catatonia and coma.[14] Diagnostic criteria Different diagnostic criteria have been proposed by different authors, including Addonizio criteria,[15] Adityanjee criteria,[16] Caroff and Mann's criteria,[17] Levenson's criteria,[7] Nirenberg criteria,[18] and Pope's criteria.[19] Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), the fifth revision,[20] has also provided the diagnostic criteria for NMS. All these criteria define NMS using similar features, with some variation given to different components, including the rise in serum creatine phosphokinase levels. According to DSM-5 criteria,[20] a patient is required to fulfill all the three primary criteria (exposure to the dopamine-blocking agent, severe muscle rigidity, and fever) and at least two other measures (diaphoresis, dysphagia, tremor, incontinence, altered level of consciousness, mutism, tachycardia, elevated or labile blood pressure, leukocytosis, and elevated creatine phosphokinase). Recently, a consensus criterion, i.e., International Expert Consensus NMS diagnostic criteria,[21] has been developed, which gives variable weightage to different symptoms. In the end, a total score is calculated, with a cutoff of 74 indicative of a diagnosis of NMS equivalent to DSM-IV TR criteria.[22] Serotonin syndrome Serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening side effect arising due to serotonin toxicity. The level of serotonin influences features of serotonin syndrome toxicity and the term serotonin syndrome is primarily used to denote the extreme end of the toxicity. It is usually seen in patients receiving more than one serotonergic agent, those receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with other medications, which can inhibit the metabolism of serotonergic agents at the CYP3A4 enzyme level and resultantly lead to an increase in the serotonin levels, or patients with medication overdose. Many medications have been implicated in the development of serotonin syndrome [Table 8].[2324252627]Table 8: Medications that can lead to the development of serotonin syndrome (adapted from[23 24 25 26 27])Severe serotonin syndrome is usually reported in those using more than one serotonergic medication in therapeutic doses or doses more than recommended, especially when monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are combined with another agent. If unrecognized, serotonin syndrome can be fatal and lead to death. The underlying mechanism for the development of serotonin syndrome includes an increase in the synthesis or release of serotonin, reduction in uptake or metabolism of serotonin, and direct activation of serotonin receptors.[24252627] Clinical features The clinical features of serotonin syndrome can vary as per the severity of the syndrome. The clinical features usually appear early, i.e., 6–24 h after the ingestion of the offending agents. However, in some instances, the clinical presentation may be delayed. The classical triad of serotonin syndrome includes altered mental status, autonomic overactivity, and neuromuscular hyperactivity [Table 9].[23242526]Table 9: Clinical features of serotonin syndrome (adapted from[24 25 26 27 28])Diagnostic criteria Two different diagnostic criteria have been proposed to diagnose serotonin syndrome, i.e., Hunter criteria and Sternbach's criteria. The Hunter criteria are decision-making criteria, which consider the use of serotonergic agents and the presence of clonus. Accordingly, serotonin toxicity should be considered to be present if the patient has either of the following: spontaneous clonus, inducible clonus, and agitation or diaphoresis, ocular clonus and agitation or diaphoresis, tremor and hyperreflexia only, hypertonia along with the temperature of >38°C, and ocular clonus or inducible clonus.[27] Sternbach's criteria require three out of the ten given clinical features, i.e., mental status changes (confusion and hypomania), agitation, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, tremor, diarrhea, incoordination, and fever. Additionally, these criteria also mention ruling out other etiologies and the absence of starting a neuroleptic agent or an increase in the dose of neuroleptics before the onset of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome.[28] Anticholinergic syndrome The anticholinergic syndrome arises due to intentional or accidental intake of anticholinergic medications or other compounds. The clinical manifestations are an outcome of antagonisms of acetylcholine in the brain and the peripheral nervous system. Therapeutic use of drugs with high anticholinergic properties can also lead to precipitation of the anticholinergic syndrome. Many medications have been reported to be associated with the development of anticholinergic syndrome [Table 10]. However, it is essential to note that this is not the complete list, and many other medications have also been reported to have a variable level of anticholinergic properties. Various scales like the Anticholinergic Burden Scale have been designed to assess the anticholinergic burden of different medications. The various risk factors for the development of anticholinergic syndrome include older age and medications with anticholinergic properties, which can have an additive effect. Other risk factors include the use of certain street drugs and herbal products/medications that also have high anticholinergic properties [Table 10].[2930]Table 10: Medications implicated for causing anticholinergic syndrome (adapted from[29])Clinical features The clinical features of the anticholinergic syndrome can be quite variable, ranging from only mild cognitive syndromes to a full-blown anticholinergic syndrome characterized by central and peripheral signs and symptoms [Table 11]. The majority of the manifestations are due to the involvement of the muscarinic receptors. The anticholinergic syndrome may also worsen preexisting medical conditions among the elderly, including precipitation of angina, congestive cardiac failure, severe constipation, urinary retention, and narrow-angle glaucoma. Hence, the elderly presenting with worsening conditions or these manifestations should also be evaluated for anticholinergic burden.[2930]Table 11: Clinical manifestations of anticholinergic syndrome[29]Diagnostic criteria There are no specific diagnostic criteria for the anticholinergic syndrome. The diagnosis usually depended on the clinician's awareness about this condition and the ability to recognize the same symptoms.[2930] ASSESSMENT Assessment of a patient presenting to the emergency with altered sensorium and autonomic and neurological symptoms should alter the psychiatrist about possible clinical presentation due to the ongoing psychotropic medications. However, the clinician should consider all possible organic causes for the altered sensorium before attributing the whole clinical presentation to the continuing medicines. It is also essential to understand that these syndromes associated with various groups of medications can also lead to multiple complications. A good history, carrying out a proper physical examination, and the findings backed by appropriate investigations can help reach a diagnosis. For NMS, the clinician should focus on the temporal correlation of onset of symptoms with starting antipsychotic medication while taking history. Additionally, the dose of the antipsychotic used and the rate of increasing the antipsychotics should be thoroughly evaluated. Other issues to be considered include looking at the concomitant medications and comorbidities. During the physical examination, the clinician should focus on fever, rigidity, sensorium, dehydration, autonomic disturbances, the color of the urine, etc. Additionally, efforts should be made to rule out other differential diagnoses [Table 12].[923242526272931]Table 12: Differential diagnosis for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27 29 31]For serotonin syndrome, while taking history, the clinician should focus on the prescribed serotonergic agents and inquire about the use of over-the-counter medications, illicit drugs, and various dietary supplements such as St John's wort, ginseng, tryptophan, and appetite suppressants. While carrying out the physical examination, a close watch should be kept on the various vital parameters and autonomic abnormalities. The neurological examination should focus on the elicitation of clonus, as this is considered the cardinal manifestation of serotonin syndrome as per Hunter's criteria. An important fact to remember while carrying out the neurological examination is that hyperreflexia and clonus are more often seen in the lower limbs. The diagnosis is usually based on the high index of suspicion and ruling out another differential diagnosis [Table 12].[923242526272931] Besides the differential diagnosis listed in Table 8, a differential diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome must also be considered in a patient with serotonin syndrome.[2324252627] Similarly, while history taking, if the anticholinergic syndrome is suspected, the clinician should focus on the whole prescription and evaluate the total anticholinergic burden, rather than just focusing on the single implicating agent. While carrying out a physical examination, attention must be paid to the skin, the blurring of vision, dryness of mouth, cardiovascular manifestations, urinary retention, and ataxia.[2930] However, it sometimes becomes difficult to distinguish between NMS, serotonin syndrome, anticholinergic syndrome, and malignant hyperthermia. This is especially the case if the patient is on polypharmacy or when the medication history is not available or clear. In such a situation, it is important to focus on the specific manifestation of these syndromes [Table 13].[923242526272931]Table 13: Distinguishing features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27, 29 31 32 33]MANAGEMENT The detailed workup of a patient suspected to have either of these syndromes requires stopping the offending medications, efforts to confirm the diagnosis, ruling out another differential diagnosis, treating the syndrome, and preventing the development of complications [Figure 1].Figure 1: Steps in the management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndromesThe first step in managing these syndromes should include the stoppage of the offending agent(s). This is often straightforward in NMS and serotonin syndrome. However, it is often tricky in anticholinergic syndrome, especially among the elderly, who have multiple physical comorbidities and receive numerous medications with variable anticholinergic properties. Accordingly, while history taking especial emphasis must be given to look for the agent which was added the last or whose doses were changed in the recent times. If such an agent is evident, the medication needs to be stopped, provided the symptoms are of mild severity. However, if such information is not available, all the medicines must be evaluated for their anticholinergic properties, and those with high anticholinergic burden should be stopped. However, it is essential to remember that stopping these agents can destabilize the underlying physical illnesses. Hence, appropriate substitute medications with low or no anticholinergic properties must be considered. Investigations for patients suspected of these syndromes are also guided by the diagnosis and differential diagnoses being considered and the overall clinical picture [Table 14].[923242526272931]Table 14: Investigations in a patient suspected to have neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, or anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27 29 31]Supportive care Supportive measures are required to manage the symptoms and prevent the development of complications. These may include measures to reduce the temperature, treat or prevent dehydration, ensure proper nutrition, and avoid organ damage, such as renal impairment in patients with NMS. Supportive measures can also include the use of benzodiazepines, if the physical health permits, to manage agitation [Table 15]. After initial stabilization, if required, gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal may be considered in patients with anticholinergic syndrome if the history suggests recent intake (i.e., <1 h) of agents in overdoses.[923242526272931]Table 15: Supportive measures in a patient suspected to have neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, or anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27 29 31]Use of specific agents or antidotes The particular agents for managing NMS include bromocriptine, dantrolene, amantadine, or dopamine agonists [Table 16]. Among these agents, bromocriptine is one of the most commonly used agents, which can be given in doses of 10–40 mg/day in divided doses. If the patient does not respond to these agents, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be considered. It is important to remember that if ECT is considered, succinylcholine should be used cautiously, given common pathophysiology of NMS and malignant hyperthermia.[931] Mild cases of serotonin syndrome can be managed with supportive care and the addition of benzodiazepines. Moderate and severe cases will require the addition of serotonin antagonists, i.e., cyproheptadine. A loading dose of 12 mg orally or through a nasogastric tube, followed by 2 mg every 2 hourly until clinical improvement is seen or 8 mg, 6 h after the symptoms have settled, is recommended. Severe cases of serotonin syndrome will require intensive supportive care to manage the symptoms and prevent complications (such as severe hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) and administration of serotonin antagonists. Patients with severe serotonin syndrome may require muscle paralysis with nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, i.e., vecuronium. Opioids should be avoided in the management of serotonin syndrome. In patients with the anticholinergic syndrome, the use of physostigmine may be considered. However, it is important to note that the use of physostigmine is not without risk as it may worsen underlying physical health conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, cardiac problems, glaucoma, and psychosis.[2324252627]Table 16: Pharmacotherapy for neuroleptic malignant syndrome[9 31]Restarting of psychotropics for the underlying mental illness Once the symptoms of NMS resolve, it is usually recommended to restart the antipsychotics only after at least after 2 weeks of resolution of symptoms. Because of the risk of recurrence, it is always advisable to monitor the patient while rechallenging the patient with antipsychotics closely.[931] There is a lack of consensus on when to restart the antidepressants in patients with serotonin syndrome once the patient recovers from serotonin syndrome. Ideally, a gap of 1–2 weeks must be considered, and if started, the patient and caregivers should be psychoeducated about the prevention of serotonin syndrome. This should include avoiding illicit drugs, prescription medications, dietary supplements, and herbal preparation that increase serotonergic transmission. Further, while restarting antidepressants, the doses should be increased slowly with close monitoring for symptoms of psychosis.[2324252627] PSYCHOTROPIC TOXICITIES AND OVERDOSE Lithium toxicity Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, and the therapeutic range for serum lithium varies from 0.4 to 1.2 mEq/L. The clinical features of lithium toxicity are usually seen when the serum lithium levels are >1.5 mEq/L. However, it is essential to remember that the toxic effects of lithium may also be seen in patients with therapeutic serum levels. The life-threatening side effects of lithium usually appear when the serum level is >2 mEq/L. In terms of toxicity, three different types of lithium toxicities have been described in the literature, which include acute (primarily manifests with gastrointestinal symptoms, and may progress to neuromuscular signs and symptoms which usually appear after 2–3 days), acute-on-chronic (presents with both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms), and chronic (present primarily with neurological symptoms) toxicities. Acute toxicity is usually seen in patients with lithium overdose. Chronic lithium toxicity is seen in patients who are on long-term lithium treatment. The toxicity manifestations are generally an outcome of either an alteration in the absorption or elimination of lithium levels. For example, any change in renal functioning (due to renal damage, hypovolemia, and use of medications that increase lithium's reabsorption) can impair the elimination of lithium and resultant accumulation of lithium levels in the body [Table 17]. Acute on chronic toxicity is seen in patients on long-term lithium, who take overdoses of lithium, either deliberately or accidentally.[34353637]Table 17: Risk factors for lithium toxicity in patients on long-term lithium treatmentUsually, the severity of lithium toxicity in patients with chronic lithium intoxication (i.e., those on long-term lithium therapy) is determined by the serum level",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychotic phenomena are not exclusive to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, nor are they contained entirely within the broader category of primary psychotic disorders Trauma-associated symptoms, dissociative disorders, borderline and paranoid personality disorder, grief, delirium, or psychologically mediated phenomena need to be considered when developing a psychiatric differential for psychotic symptoms. The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

      "title": "Using ’White Flags’ to categorize socio-cultural aspects in chronic pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Issue Persistent chronic pain is a major medical and health economic problem. To assess the individual pain situation, the classification of various factors (flags) has been established. Description of the problem Structural biomechanical factors are classified as “red flags”. Psychological or behavioral factors are summarized as “yellow flags”, psychiatric and mental illness as “orange flags”. Both last flags are important for planning adequate therapies or rehabilitation, as well as for decisions to prognoses and tailored reintegration programs. An extension of the flag model was achieved by naming personal factors at workplace as “blue flags”, and “black flags”, if there is a restriction for returning to work. All these groups do not consider other important reasons for unsuccessful rehabilitation or failed reintegration. Results In these cases, often described as ’therapy-refractory’, clients often exhibit a special subjective understanding of illness that reacts neither to psychological interventions nor to behavioral therapies. These include individual beliefs based, for example, on cultural socialization, religious education, or spiritual experiences. Since such individual mental illnesses are culturally ideologically or religiously justified, they should be classified in a separate group called ’white flags’. Lessons The advantages of categorizing sociocultural aspects separately from other flag classifications are avoidance of unnecessary therapies, including surgery,prevention of iatrogenisation,prevention of legal disputes. It is important to realize that only health restrictions for insurance benefits can be taken into account and that individual socio-cultural circumstances or health convictions are not evaluated. Main messages: A classification of ’white flags’ could contribute to a better classification of pain which are not accessible to various therapies and reduce reservations and misunderstandings by intercultural communication approaches. Key messages For medical professions it is important to recognize, that only health inabilities are taken into account for insurance compensation and not individual socio-cultural circumstances or health beliefs. In Future classifying ’white flags’ could help to properly assess persistent pain conditions.",

      "title": "Anxiety disorders",
      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

      "title": "Treatment management of psychoactive substance use disorders",
      "abstract": "The use and abuse of psychoactive substances and the complications that derive from them represent a major public health problem. An increasing numbers of new psychoactive substances (NPS) are available on the market as previous substances disappear, generating a constant flow of drugs and constant variations in psychopharmacological properties. This dynamic comes with important difficulties in identifying the substances and their psychopharmacological mechanisms and in the substance-specific treatment. The International Classification of Diseases, the 11th revision (ICD-11), reclassifies the substances and pathologies to enable a better management of the disorders. Psychiatry occupies an important role in the management of substance use disorders along with several medical specialties, psychology, psychotherapy and other fields. The pharmacological treatment of these disorders can be applied in acute states such as acute intoxication and overdose, withdrawal states, substance-induced psychosis, delirium and also in the long-term management of withdrawal. Severe cases of agitation and aggressiveness were observed in patients using especially NPS and not rarely with legal implications. One particular situation that began to emerge on a worldwide scale is the multiple-drug use where the psychoactive substances can create unpredictable and life-threatening situations. In these cases, the treatment implies advanced knowledge of pharmacology and the long-term management has poor outcomes.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

El estudio incluyo historia clinica completa, examenes de laboratorio, interrogatorio sobre habitos y niveles de consumo, y consecuencias sociales del consumo de alcohol. Ademas, se diseno un cuestionario para la identificacion temprana de los bebedores que abusan del alcohol en forma excesiva. Se encontro que el consumo excesivo de alcohol esta asociado con numerosos signos y sintomas relacionados con el aparato cardiovascular, el digestivo y el sistema nervioso central, incluyendo la esfera mental. Asimismo, que estas manifestaciones producen, con cierta frecuencia, confusion en el medico y son atribuidas a otros procesos patologicos. La aplicacion del cuestionario, denominado AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), permitio establecer ciertos indicadores clinicos de las fases tempranas de consumo peligroso de alcohol; de ellos destacan: insomnio y/o ansiedad, temblor distal de miembros superiores, trastornos digestivos vagos, accidentes frecuentes, impuntualidad en el trabajo y/o ausentismo laboral, tension nerviosa sin causa aparente, elevacion de la gamaglutamil-transferasa, aumento del volumen globular medio, macrocitosis sin anemia y aumento de lipoproteinas de alta densidad. El analisis de estos resultados demostro que el AUDIT es un instrumento de tamizaje altamente sensible (80%) y especifico (89%), con un valor promedio predictivo positivo de 60% y un valor promedio predictivo negativo de 95%. La aplicacion sistematica del AUDIT, particularmente en el primer nivel de atencion medica, podria ser de gran beneficio para los pacientes y para la comunidad.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical syndrome with a high degree of morbidity that may follow a traumatic event. PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Impulse control disorders: DSM-5 and beyond",
      "abstract": "In DSM-IV-TR, five different psychiatric disorders (intermittent explosive disorder-IED, kleptomania, pyromania, pathological gambling and trichotillomania) which have impulsivity as a common feature and could not be classified as a part of another diagnostic category, are included in a left over category named as ‘impulse control disorder not elsewhere classified’.1 In the last 20 years, studies conducted on these disorders have revealed that some of these disorders are more prevalent than previously thought, and lead to a different diagnostic categorization in DSM-5.2 In DSM-5 the category of ‘disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence’ has been removed and integrated into other categories. Similarly the category of ‘impulse control disorder not elsewhere classified’ has been deleted and some of the disorders in this category (IED, kleptomania, pyromania) in combination with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) formed a new category named ‘disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders’.2 Common feature of the disorders in this category is problems of selfcontrol and having trouble in emotional or behavioral dysregulation. Besides all of disorders included in this category have behaviors that clearly violate the rights of others and aggressive behaviors leading to destruction of property.3,4 Two disorders formerly included in impulse control disorders section were removed and reclassified in other categories. Pathological gambling is renamed as ‘gambling disorder’ and included in ‘substance related and addictive disorders’ whereas trichotillomania is included in ‘obsessive compulsive and related disorders’ chapter. Though this diagnostic classification recovers the impulse control disorders from being a residual category, it also brings in the concerns about conducting new studies on these disorders as they will be over-shadowed by more prevalent disorders in the same category. This concern is also introduced in a workshop conducted by The ICD-11 Working Group on Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.5 The Working Group has recommended that a grouping of impulse control disorders be retained in ICD-11 in order to ensure opportunities to conduct more specific studies on these issues. Workgroup has stated that categorizing gambling behavior as an addiction, although heuristically appealing, seems premature based on the evidence and suggested continuation of its inclusion in this category. As a final statement, Workgroup recommended that impulse control disorders category should include pathological gambling, intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, and pyromania and compulsive sexual behavior disorder.5 These findings lead us to suggest that the debate on the classification of impulse control disorders may increase rather than decrease with the introduction of ICD-11.",

The classic signs and symptoms (toxidrome) often seen with the sympathomimetic drugs include hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia; some of these drugs also precipitate psychoses, hallucinations and seizures. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is experiencing a sympathomimetic drug reaction can be helpful to the clinician. However, some of the conventional toxicologic drug screens used by many clinical laboratories do not differentiate within a specific class of drugs (eg, amphetamine vs methamphetamine). Although a drug screen can help to confirm ingestion of a sympathomimetic drug, diagnosis and treatment are often based on history of use (often unreliable), physical examination, and the classic toxidrome observed with this class of drugs.",

W pracy przedstawiono i omówiono doniesienia o niewłaściwym używaniu kwetiapiny, nadużywaniu, a nawet uzależnieniu psychicznym, a także o objawach zbliżonych do tak zwanego zespołu dyskontynuacji, często mylonego z zespołem abstynencyjnym występującym w przebiegu uzależnienia.

Z tego względu należy pamiętać o ostrożności w przepisywaniu kwetiapiny tym osobom. W artykule dyskutowane są potencjalne mechanizmy, które mogą prowadzić do niewłaściwego używania kwetiapiny. Jest to prawdopodobnie związane z działaniem sedatywnym i przeciwlękowym co powoduje jej częste stosowanie z substancjami pobudzającymi.

      "abstract": "Drug facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) is an offense in which victims are subject to unwanted sexual activity while they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol and are therefore not able to resist the assault, or we can say a sexual activity in which consent is invalid or absent because the victim is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Some common date rape drugs are Rohypnol, GHB, and Ketamine, but it is observed that alcohol was more prevalent in cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault in contrast to other date rape drugs.The major problem in DFSA cases is underreporting of the incidence due to amnesia.The victim has difficulty recalling what happened, and sometimes they are reluctant to report due to voluntary drug use or family pressure, or fear of society.Most of the instance's cases are written later, which hinders the analysis, especially when rapidly metabolizing drugs are used.In case of the absence of injuries, the chances of misdiagnosis increase.There is a need to create a safe space where victims can reach and open up about their problems to get much-needed emotional and mental support.This paper reviews how prevalent are drug-facilitated sexual assault cases throughout the world, how to treat the post-assault symptoms, and what all new techniques have been researched to detect drugs.",

      "abstract": "Chronische Insomnie, d. h. Klagen über Ein- und Durchschlafstörungen, frühmorgendliches Erwachen und damit verbundene Beeinträchtigung der Befindlichkeit während des Tages betreffen etwa 10 % der Bevölkerung in den meisten westlichen Industrienationen. Ursächlich für chronische Schlaflosigkeit können körperliche Erkrankungen, psychische Erkrankungen, die Einnahme von Medikamenten, Genussmittel oder Drogen sein. Ein Drittel aller chronischen Insomnien wird als primäre Insomnie oder insomnische Störung bezeichnet, wenn keiner der oben genannten Faktoren ursächlich identifiziert werden kann. Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden. Die kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutischen Techniken der Insomniebehandlung können von darin geschulten Ärzten und Psychotherapeuten mit Erfolg eingesetzt werden.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis represents a milestone in the progression of PD, often severely taxing caregivers and frequently warranting nursing-home placement. This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "abstract": "Narcotics have been known to man since prehistoric times, and they continue to be among the most used analgesics in the practice of medicine. They comprise a group of drugs whose analgesic effect is coupled with euphoria and somnolence. In addition, their spasmogenic effect on smooth muscle has made them useful agents in the alleviation of certain gastrointestinal tract symptoms. For most narcotics, therapeutic dosage does not produce serious untoward effects. Unfortunately, they have a depressant effect on respiration by directly influencing the respiratory center of the brain. This may be life threatening when recommended dosages are exceeded. Narcotics have been abused since the recognition that they can induce euphoria and a feeling of well being. Tolerance and physical and psychological dependence result from their repeated use. The occurrence of withdrawal symptomatology in humans using these drugs repeatedly helps to produce a pattern of drug dependence; an individual has but to repeat a dose of drug in order to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Abuse liability is thus great. All narcotics share this addiction potential. Those most frequently prescribed in clinical medicine are morphine, trieperidine, codeine and methadone. Heroin (diacetylmorphine), the most commonly abused narcotic, available only illicitly, is not prescribed in clinical practice. After injection, it is hydrolyzed to morphine which produces its pharmacological action. While morphine and heroin are absorbed only following parenteral administration, some narcotics are absorbed readily from the gastrointestinal tract as well as after injection (methadone, codeine, meperidine). Regardless of the mode of administration, narcotics taken by a pregnant addict readily pass the placental barrier and are capable of producing effects on the infant in utero and after birth.",

Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

Sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and neuroleptic drugs tend to be the most commonly used psychotropic medications among elderly people who are not developmentally disabled. These drugs are probably commonly employed among elderly mentally retarded people as well; although the rank order of use probably differs. A number of physiological changes which accompany greater age are described and the impact on pharmacokinetic variables outlined. Other factors associated with aging, which influence drug actions, are also outlined. The net effect appears to be that most drugs are more potent, more toxic, or longer lasting among the elderly. Data are also presented on tardive dyskinesia insofar as aging is concerned. This is followed by overall conclusions and some suggested guidelines for the use of these drugs in older mentally retarded persons.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection which can cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vascular symptoms. The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2-3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein-Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS. Further research is required to determine the natural history of this condition, as well as to define risk factors, prevalence, and possible interventional strategies.",

The economic consequences of drug addiction are staggering all over the World. Although great strides have been made in understanding the nature of addiction, it is still not well understood. Drug addiction can be considered a chronic brain disease that affects neurotransmission between circuits of neurons that control behavior, emotion and cognition; character­ized by an excessive engagement in drug use, unsuccessful attempts in controlling drug intake, an increase in anxiety and emotional pain, and inaccurate beliefs about drug use [1]. It is a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by: (a) compulsion to seek and take the drug, (b) loss of control in limiting intake and (c) emergence of a negative emotional state (e.g., dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) when access to the drug is prevented.",

Because addiction to alcohol and other drugs is the most common and researched form of addiction. Addiction is difficult to define and its understanding changes with new scientific discoveries. Addictions counseling in the United States continues its transition from being a rather ingrown, isolated, and loosely regulated practice that once relied primarily on personal evidence, subjective testimony, and the sufficiency of mutual support, to being a sophisticated practice informed by science, integrated into mainstream health care, and offering a menu of evidence-based practices. Involving family members in prevention and treatment efforts of an adolescent or adult struggling with problematic substance use is now standard practice in addictions.",

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

The symptoms disappeared after the medication was reintroduced but recurred after rediscontinuation. When the dosage was diminished very gradually the symptoms were mild. The depression did not recur. Such withdrawal symptoms are most prevalent after discontinuation of paroxetine but can occur after use of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The withdrawal syndrome includes both physical and psychiatric symptoms and needs to be distinguished from a relapse of the psychiatric disorder. Good information and gradual discontinuation of the antidepressant after long-term use are adequate measures to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Known as \"new generation antidepressants\", they belong either to classical families of anti-depressants (tricyclics or MAOIs) or to new pharmacological groups. The first ones differ from classical tricyclics or classical MAOIs for the absence of major contraindications for their use (mostly few or no anticholinergic properties for new tricyclics and no dietary restriction rules for new MAOIs). The nontricyclics-non MAOIs antidepressants are, for most of them, particularly well tolerated and safe. The clinical potency of such compounds seems to reach conditions beyond depressive states and they have indeed some specific effects in obsessive-compulsive disorders or other anxiety disorders. In this group, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to represent a major progress in antidepressive therapy. All these advantages invite now the practitioners to use these \"new generation antidepressants\" as the first choice medication, when treating uncomplicated depressive disorders.",

Anticonvulsant, antidepressant, and antipsychotic drugs can be associated with significant liver injury or liver failure, but this is relatively rare compared to other non-psychotropic drug classes. More commonly, mild asymptomatic elevations in liver function tests are seen and these are not predictive of progression to more severe liver injury. Laboratory monitoring of liver function before and during treatment is recommended with the use of valproic acid and carbamazepine, but not for other psychotropic drugs, although regular laboratory testing is not a reliable method for detecting or preventing severe liver injury. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity or hypersensitivity reactions that affect the liver is more important.

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three. These different definitions suggest that FMS is more than one disorder and that other criteria are probably needed.Conclusions: Our definition of probable or “in complete” FMS is based on the presence of spontaneous, wide spread, persistent pain, fatigue, and peripheral symptoms such as stiffness, of ten modulated by weather changes, stress, and exercise.Our definition of mechanical allodynia is based on pressure induced tendino-muscular pain [tenderness] usually associated with central symptoms such as sleep disorders [TePs syndrome].Fibromyalgia might then be defined by the association of two distinct conditions: incomplete FMS [spontaneous, diffuse pain, and fatigue], and tenderness [mechanical allodynia], both having been aggravated by physical deconditioning.",

      "abstract": "Long COVID is now well accepted as an ongoing post-viral syndrome resulting from infection of a single virus, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2. It mirrors the post-viral fatigue syndrome, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a global debilitating illness arising mainly from sporadic geographically-specific viral outbreaks, and from community endemic infections, but also from other stressors. Core symptoms of both syndromes are post-exertional malaise (a worsening of symptoms following mental or physical activity), pervasive fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog), and sleep disturbance. Long COVID patients frequently also suffer from shortness of breath, relating to the lung involvement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is no universally accepted pathophysiology, or recognized biomarkers yet for Long COVID or indeed for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Clinical case definitions with very similar characteristics for each have been defined. Chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and disrupted energy production in the peripheral system has been confirmed in Long COVID and has been well documented in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Neuroinflammation occurs in the brain in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as shown from a small number of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies, and has now been demonstrated for Long COVID. Oxidative stress, an increase in reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, and free radicals, has long been suggested as a potential cause for many of the symptoms seen in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, resulting from both activation of the brain’s immune system and dysregulation of mitochondrial function throughout the body. The brain as a high producer of energy may be particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. It has been shown in peripheral immune cells that the balanced production of proteins involved in regulation of the reactive oxygen species in mitochondria is disturbed in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Fluctuations in the chronic low level neuroinflammation during the ongoing course of Long COVID as well as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome have been proposed to cause the characteristic severe relapses in patients. This review explores oxidative stress as a likely significant contributor to the pathophysiology of Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and the mechanisms by which oxidative stress could cause the symptoms seen in both syndromes. Treatments that could mitigate oxidative stress and thereby lessen the debilitating symptoms to improve the life of patients are discussed.",

      "title": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor-Induced Serotonin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The selective pharmacology of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) results in a lower potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions relative to other antidepressants such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).However, the SSRIs have been implicated in the development of the serotonin syndrome-a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with psychotropic drugs. The syndrome is produced most often by the concurrent use of two or more drugs that enhance central nervous system serotonin activity and often goes unrecognized because of the varied and nonspecific nature of its clinical features. The serotonin syndrome is characterized by alterations in cognition (disorientation, confusion), behavior (agitation, restlessness), autonomic nervous system function (fever, shivering, diaphoresis, diarrhea), and neuromuscular (ataxia, hyperreflexia, myoclonus) activity. The difference between this syndrome and the occurrence of adverse effects caused by serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone is the clustering of the signs and symptoms, their severity, and their duration. There are important pharmacokinetic interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs due principally to their effects on the cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes, the potential for which varies widely amongst the SSRI group, which may increase the likelihood of a pharmacodynamic interaction. The exceptionally long washout period required after fluoxetine discontinuation may cause additional problems and/or inconvenience. Patients with serotonin syndrome usually respond to discontinuation of drug therapy and supportive care alone, but they may also require treatment with an antiserotonergic agent such as cyproheptadine, methysergide, and/or propranolol. To reduce the occurrence, morbidity, and mortality of the serotonin syndrome, it must be both prevented by prudent pharmacotherapy and given prompt recognition when it is present.

Our aim was to stress the main clinical features of this syndrome. Serotonin re-uptake inhibitor withdrawal syndrome generally begins within 24 to 48 hours after discontinuing the drug. Signs reach their maximum on day 5 and usually resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Withdrawal syndrome is more common with short half-life drugs (paroxetine, fluvoxamine). The intensity of the clinical signs depends on the daily dose and how long the drug has been given. The main signs are dizziness, vertigo, headache, nausea, and flu-like symptoms as well as anxiety, confusion, irritability, excessive dreaming and insomnia. Risk factors usually stressed are poor treatment compliance, previous withdrawal syndrome with another drug, concomitant medication and alcohol consumption. The syndrome can be prevented by tapering off the dose and patient education. When a withdrawal syndrome is present, it is advisable to reintroduce the drug then withdraw gradually.",

It overlaps with frontal brain aging consequences. Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "abstract": "The disease-centred model suggests that the important or ‘therapeutic’ effects of drugs are achieved by their effects on aparticular disease process. By acting on the mechanisms of the disease, drugs move the human organism from an abnormal physiological state towards a morenormal one. In contrast, the drug-centred model suggests that drugs themselves create abnormal bodily states. In the case of drugs that act on the brain or the nervous system, these states involve an alteration in subjective experience or consciousness. Psychiatric drugs are psychoactive drugs which, by their neurophysiological effects alter ‘mental and emotional life and behaviour for the duration of the treatment’ (Cohen &Jacobs 2007). When we consider drugs that are taken recreationally we have no trouble recognising this fact and we refer to the altered mental state drugs produce as ‘intoxication’. But there is no fundamental distinction between drugs used for psychiatric purposes and other psychoactive drugs. They all act on the nervous system to produce astate of altered consciousness, astate that is distinct from the normal undrugged state. The only difference is that the state produced by recreational drugs is pleasurable whereas the effects produced by most psychiatric drugs are experienced as unpleasant. The characteristic features of the drug-induced state varyaccording to the chemical nature of the particular drug and its interaction with the brain and in subsequent chapters Iwill describe the features produced by ingesting some commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "Negli ultimi decenni, il concetto di dipendenza ha subito un'e- spansione significativa, estendendosi oltre le classiche dipendenze da sostanze, come droghe e alcol, per includere una gamma di comportamenti che possono manifestare caratteristiche simili di compulsività e perdita di controllo. Queste dipendenze comportamentali, \"addiction senza sostanze\", comprendono una varietà di attività come il gioco d'azzardo patologico, la dipendenza da inter- net e dai social media, lo shopping compulsivo, la dipendenza da sesso e l'uso eccessivo di videogiochi, tra gli altri. Con il termine \"addiction\" si definisce una condizione generale in cui la dipendenza psicologica spinge alla ricerca dell'oggetto, senza di esso la propria esistenza perde significato. Nello specifico facciamo riferimento ad una serie di condotte disfunzionali nelle quali l'oggetto della dipendenza non è una sostanza ma un determinato comportamento. Esse si caratterizzano per la presenza di comportamenti ripetitivi che il soggetto tro- va difficili da controllare nonostante le conseguenze negative. Similmente alle dipendenze da sostanze, queste comportano una ricerca compulsiva del com- portamento, tolleranza ovvero il bisogno di aumentare l'intensità o la frequenza del comportamento per ottenere lo stesso effetto, l'elevato impiego di risorse in termini economici di energia e tempo, e sintomi di astinenza psicologica quan- do il comportamento viene interrotto. Inoltre, le dipendenze comportamentali spesso portano a un deterioramento significativo delle relazioni personali, della performance lavorativa e della salute fisica e mentale. Questo fenomeno ha at- tirato l'attenzione della comunità scientifica, evidenziando la necessità di una comprensione più approfondita dei meccanismi sottostanti, delle conseguenze sulla salute mentale e fisica e delle strategie di trattamento efficaci. Trattamen- ti classici in unione a trattamenti innovativi come la Stimolazione Magnetica Transcranica si integrano per ottenere maggiori risultati clinici.",

It is more conflicting the data about if they can produce or unmask vulnerabilities to long term psychiatric disorders; or to affect its course and phenomenology; or to influence the response to the therapeutic resources used to treat them, beyond the period of abstinence. The objective is to update the knowledge available on the ability of the marijuana and the stimulants to produce long term psychiatric disorders, or to unmask vulnerabilities to them. We have done an electronic bibliographical research in MEDLINE using the following key words: psychiatric disorders, amphetamine, stimulants, marijuana, cannabis, long term effects, psychosis, cognitive and cognitive deficits. The marijuana might induce permanent psychosis in subjects with vulnerability to schizophrenia or to psychosis. The cognitive effects are acute and subacute, related with the presence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the central nervous system. The stimulants can produce a schizophrenia-like psychosis, and they can produce long term cognitive deficits. The stimulants also might produce subsyndromic mood disorders.",

Treatment can vary from none at all (eg, in the child with a single febrile seizure) to the use of more than one drug and the ketogenic diet (eg, in poorly controlled atypical absence, atonic, and some myoclonic disorders). When drug therapy is required, an appropriate agent is started and the dosage increased as needed to control seizures. If seizures persist or toxicity occurs, another drug should be substituted. When the patient has been seizure-free for a year, the drug can be slowly decreased and eventually discontinued. Any recurrence is most likely to occur within the first year after anticonvulsive medication is stopped.",

      "abstract": "The prevalences of methamphetamine and organic solvent abuses are most serious social problems concerning drug abuse in Japan, and such prevalences tend to progressively extend in spite of a strong legal regulation. The drug abuses are not only problems connected with gangstar and juvenile delinquent groups, but also based on a common mechanism to our daily habits, such as drinking alcohol and tea, and smoking cigaretts, i.e., self-administraion of dependence-producing drugs. All of the dependence-producing drugs usually show psychotropic effects, and the effects frequently elicit an euphoria, which becomes a reinforcing effect of drug-taking behavior. The problems of drug abuse/dependence are not only drug-taking behavior itself, but also the psychotoxic effects of these drugs. Amphetamines, cocaine, organic solvents etc. show a strong psychotoxic effect, and easily elicit paranoid-hallucinative schizophrenia-like symptoms. The effect is enhanced by repeated administration of these drugs, i.e., development of reverse tolerance. The reverse tolerance to the psychotoxic effect once produced persists for a long period, and frequently causes the acute exacerbation of schizophrenia-like symptoms. The development of tolerance to the euphorogenic effect of drugs results in an increase in the dose, frequency and number of the drug abuse, and simultaneously accelerates development of reverse tolerance to the psychotoxic effect. In this review, we will discuss drug-abuse problems from the social and pharmacological viewpoints.",

      "abstract": "Although benzodiazepines are invaluable in the treatment of anxiety disorders, they have some potential for abuse and may cause dependence or addiction. It is important to distinguish between addiction to and normal physical dependence on benzodiazepines. Intentional abusers of benzodiazepines usually have other substance abuse problems. Benzodiazepines are usually a secondary drug of abuse-used mainly to augment the high received from another drug or to offset the adverse effects of other drugs. Few cases of addiction arise from legitimate use of benzodiazepines. Pharmacologic dependence, a predictable and natural adaptation of a body system long accustomed to the presence of a drug, may occur in patients taking therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. However, this dependence, which generally manifests itself in withdrawal symptoms upon the abrupt discontinuation of the medication, may be controlled and ended through dose tapering, medication switching, and/or medication augmentation. Due to the chronic nature of anxiety, long-term low-dose benzodiazepine treatment may be necessary for some patients; this continuation of treatment should not be considered abuse or addiction.",

There are still few studies trying to assess the presence of a possible association between increased risk of accident/injury at work and consumption of psychotropic substances and results are not always in agreement.

      "abstract": "Buprenorphine, a partial μ-opioid agonist and κ-opioid antagonist, is frequently used in the treatment of heroin dependence, and to prevent complications arising from intravenous injection and social consequences of heroin use. Psychosis occurring after discontinuation of buprenorphine or other opioids has been described, but is uncommon. We report the case of a 37-year-old man, suffering from opiates dependence, presenting acute and intense psychotic symptoms beginning after an abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine, which he was taking for two years as substitution therapy for heroin dependence. The initial medication by risperidone, up to a dose of 8 mg/day was inefficient to control psychotic symptoms. Four weeks later, buprenorphine was finally restarted at 8 mg/day, which allowed a complete remission of psychotic and anxiety-related symptoms. The antipsychotic medication was gradually discontinued two months later, allowing the patient to remain symptom-free eighteen months later. We discuss the potential role of abrupt withdrawal syndrome in the apparition of the psychotic symptoms and the presence of a latent psychotic disorder. An interesting issue in our case report is that a correctly conducted antipsychotic treatment did not succeed in stopping symptoms of delusions, even after four weeks, while reintroducing buprenorphine did, showing in this context an antipsychotic effect. This case report highlights the importance of taking opiate dependence into account in patients with recent onset of psychotic symptoms, even several weeks after withdrawal.",

      "title": "Pharmacy medications and driving: delivering key information to ageing drivers",
      "abstract": "Ageing road users face an increased risk of fatality and serious injury in a crash due to their fragility and other issues associated with ageing. A high proportion of ageing driver fatalities involves multiple vehicle accidents, with many occurring at intersections. Complex traffic situations become more demanding, particularly in combination with deteriorating hearing, vision, reaction time and/or mobility. A range of research recently reviewed by the TAC also highlights that as drivers age, there is a higher prevalence of medication usage for health purposes, but the use of these medications can often and unknowingly, impair driving ability. Taking multiple medications increases the chance that driving will be impaired. Likewise, mixing of drugs with alcohol also has the potential to increase the level of impairment. Main classes of drugs that are impairing include anxiety, depression, any emotional condition, cold and cough, antihistamines, and epilepsy drugs. The TAC has undertaken a project to provide all drivers (but primarily those aged 60 years and over) with up-to-date information and associated safety advice about specific pharmacy medications and how they can impair driving ability/judgment, so that they can make an informed decision about their driving capabilities. This paper will describe the research and development of this initiative, including the comprehensive stakeholder engagement process.",

Under this heading, a number of psychoses is being grouped which have the common characteristic that the patient is, as a rule, but by no means always, fully conscious. In all other respects, no other points agree, neither in respect of symptoms, nor in respect of etiology or prognosis. Hence, there are hardly any reasons to reduce these disease patterns to a common denominator, either as \"schizophrenia\" or as a \"group of schizophrenic psychoses\". Rather, it seems more probable that schizophrenic psychoses are individual disease patterns, instead of being variations of a basic type. What is principally needed at this stage, is a fair amount of empirical research to catalog the concept of schizophrenia. Such a catalog would have to be based on exactly defined and described syndromes to enable further study whether there are any other points besides these symptoms which characterize the syndrome in question, such as etiology, pathogenetic factors, course, or response treatment. The more characteristics are found, the greater the chance that the disease pattern under investigation is really a unit by itself. In the course of these studies, and in order to avoid terminological confusion, it is advisable to use, for the time being, the term \"schizophrenic psychoses\", under the condition that in each concrete case this term must be supplemented by a careful typification of the symptomatology, of the etiologic factors, and of the course of the disease.",

      "abstract": "The number of persons with drug induced sexual dysfunction has risen simultaneously with the unending increase in the number of commercially available drugs. Sexual dysfunction may seriously impair the human psyche. Patients do not often admit to sexual dysfunction, however, so physicians often miss the symptoms entirely. In addition, they may attribute them to other causes, such as depression. Drugs disrupt all 3 neurophysiologic phases of sexual response (desire, excitement, and orgasm), especially in men, either causing a decrease or loss of libido, impotence (the most common symptom), or failure of ejaculation or anorgasmia. The mechanisms involved are not well understood. Researchers do know, however, that the drug cimetidine (Tagamet) blocks androgen receptors, decreases testosterone synthesis, and induces higher circulating levels of estradiol resulting in impotence and breast enlargement in men. Antihypertensive drugs have a higher frequency of causing sexual dysfunction, particularly impotence, than other drugs. Some also induce or worsen depression that can in turn cause or intensify sexual dysfunction. Both legal and illegal psychoactive drugs act on multiple sites thus often stimulating sexual dysfunction. Further, some hormonal drugs also induce sexual side effects, such as norethindrone and progesterone. Physicians who prescribe a drug associated with sexual side effects should inform patients about their possible occurrence and recommend that they be aware of the symptoms. They should ask these patients do not usually offer this information themselves. If sexual dysfunction develops, physicians can reduce the dosage or switch to an alternative drug. At that time, they should express optimism that the sexual dysfunction will cease.",

There are no specific pharmacological treatments for executive function. Consider trials of caffeine, stimulants, donepezil or rivastigmine, modafinil, or dopaminergic agents.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction and addictions to foods, sex, gambling, exercise, and many other things are widespread in modern societies. Addiction or dependence are terms used to describe persistent psychoactive drug use, but these terms also can be applied to other forms of repetitive behaviors. Many of these repetitive behaviors are regulated by specific regions of the brain that are influenced by drugs. Consequently, drug addiction may involve effects on systems that are involved in regulating forms of addiction that are necessary for the maintenance of life. Addictions also seem to be regulated by genetic factors. Because drug addiction may influence the activities of systems that evolved to regulate behaviors necessary to survive (ie, eating and drinking) and because individuals may differ in addict-ability for a given drug caused by genetic reasons, addiction should be considered as a disease and therapy should be developed with this concept in mind.",

Somnambulism include performing of complex motor activity in an automatic manner during deep sleep, without any awareness of its execution. The locked-in syndrome is a state with quadriplegia coexisting with cranial nerves palsies and mutism, but with fully preserved consciousness.

However, taking the overall clinical course into consideration, withdrawal syndrome could have been affected by some factors. One of the possibilities is that delusion might have been induced by aripiprazole. There still may be some other unknown influential factors on withdrawal, which are indicated by previous papers.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion: La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa causada por la perdida selectiva de neuronas dopaminergicas de la sustancia negra pars compacta y de otros nucleos del troncoencefalico. Se caracteriza por la presencia de sintomas motores, por el deposito difuso de alfa-sinucleina (componente de los cuerpos de Lewy) y por trastornos cognitivos, los cuales se presentan en grado variable alrededor de los 10 a los 15 anos de evolucion, lo cual retrasa de forma importante algun tipo de intervencion. Asimismo, en algunos casos no se logra identificar si el deterioro que muestran los pacientes con EP es propio del envejecimiento normal del sujeto o se debe a la evolucion de la enfermedad. Objetivo: Analizar los rendimientos cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia (GPO1), comparando los resultados con los obtenidos por una muestra de sujetos sin EP (GP2), sin antecedentes neurologicos o psiquiatricos clinicamente demostrables y con caracteristicas sociodemograficas similares a los pacientes con EP. Procedimiento: Participaron voluntariamente 80 sujetos mexicanos (40 hombres y 40 mujeres). Una vez satisfechos los criterios de inclusion, los participantes del GPO1 Y GPO2 fueron evaluados con la Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve en Espanol NEUROPSI, (Ostrosky-Solis, Ardila y Rosselli, 1994). Resultados: Nuestros datos indican que los sujetos con EP sin demencia presentan un rendimiento cognitivo inferior en comparacion con los resultados obtenidos por el grupo de sujetos sin EP, particularmente en tareas de orientacion en tiempo, de fluidez semantica, de fluidez fonologica, de escritura, funciones motoras, memoria visoespacial y memoria verbal. Asimismo, se mostro que la ejecucion de las tareas de deteccion visual, de denominacion, de repeticion y de lectura en voz alta, por parte del grupo con EP, recibieron un mejor puntaje en comparacion de lo realizado por el grupo sin EP. Finalmente, aunque el analisis de los resultados mostro que los puntajes obtenidos por ambos grupos en las tareas de orientacion en lugar y persona, de digitos en regresion, de resta sucesiva, de curva de memoria espontanea, de relacion de semejanzas, de calculo y de secuenciacion, no guardan diferencias significativas entre si, sus rendimientos generales son bajos. Conclusiones: El analisis de nuestros resultados nos permite concluir que los sujetos con EP, presentan un rendimiento cognitivo inferior en comparacion al obtenido por el grupo de sujetos sanos con caracteristicas sociodemograficas semejantes en la Bateria NEUROPSI. El analisis cualitativo de los resultados, nos permite realizar no solo la enumeracion de los sintomas como elementos aislados, sino que nos permite establecer posibles vias de intervencion neuropsicologica.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by intense fatigue, with duration of over six months and associated to other related symptoms. The latter include asthenia and easily induced tiredness that is not recovered after a night's sleep. The fatigue becomes so severe that it forces a 50% reduction in daily activities. Given its unknown aetiology, different hypotheses have been considered to explain the origin of the condition (from immunological disorders to the presence of post-traumatic oxidative stress), although there are no conclusive diagnostic tests. Diagnosis is established through the exclusion of other diseases causing fatigue. This syndrome is rare in childhood and adolescence, although the fatigue symptom per se is quite common in paediatric patients. Currently, no curative treatment exists for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. The therapeutic approach to this syndrome requires a combination of different therapeutic modalities. The specific characteristics of the symptomatology of patients with chronic fatigue require a rapid adaptation of the educational, healthcare and social systems to prevent the problems derived from current systems. Such patients require multidisciplinary management due to the multiple and different issues affecting them. This document was realized by one of the Interdisciplinary Work Groups from the Institute for Rare Diseases, and its aim is to point out the main social and care needs for people affected with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. For this, it includes not only the view of representatives for different scientific societies, but also the patient associations view, because they know the true history of their social and sanitary needs. In an interdisciplinary approach, this work also reviews the principal scientific, medical, socio-sanitary and psychological aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.",

Adaptations in key parts of the brain manifest as tolerance, where more drug is required to achieve the same effects, and to withdrawal in the absence of the drug. With repetitive use comes attribution of salience to the drug. Associated environmental items become conditioned stimuli that drive further, repetitive drug-seeking behaviour.",

      "title": "Persistent Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Persistent negative symptoms represent an alternative approach for assessing negative symptoms in the context of clinical trials. Persistent negative symptoms are designed to capture those symptoms that lead to functional impairment but are currently understudied and for which there are no currently available effective treatments. Persistent negative symptoms differ from the 2 most commonly used approaches: primary, enduring negative symptoms or deficit symptoms and negative symptoms broadly defined to include negative symptoms, regardless of their etiology or duration. In contrast to deficit symptoms, persistent negative symptoms may include secondary negative symptoms. However, in contrast to negative symptoms broadly defined, the secondary negative symptoms included in the assessment of persistent negative symptoms only include those that have failed to respond to usual treatments for secondary negative symptoms. In consequence, the presence of persistent negative symptoms identifies a patient population with clinically relevant symptomatology, which is larger than the one with the deficit syndrome but less heterogeneous than that captured through the use of a nonrestrictive definition of negative symptoms. This may facilitate the selection of subjects for inclusion into research and efforts to develop new pharmacological treatments and enhance our understanding of a relevant clinical problem. Ultimately, the investigation of the different entities characterized by negative symptoms, such as persistent negative symptoms, and the enhanced understanding of their biological and clinical characteristics may help to unravel the psychopathological and biological heterogeneity of schizophrenia.",

Patienten mit vorbestehender kognitiver Leistungsminderung sind häufiger betroffen. Ein Zusammenhang mit der Entstehung einer Demenz ist aber bisher nicht nachgewiesen. Die pathophysiologischen Mechanismen sind ungeklärt. Anästhetika oder die Art der Narkose haben keinen entscheidenden Einfluss, ebenso ist die Art des operativen Eingriffs eher sekundär. Die kognitive Reserve des einzelnen Patienten scheint aber einen entscheidenden Stellenwert für das Entstehen einer POCD darzustellen. Therapiemöglichkeiten sind bisher nicht bekannt.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by complex motor and nonmotor symptoms. The clinical diagnosis of PD is defined by bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, although several nonmotor symptoms are also related to disability, an impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. Levodopa, which is used as a standard pharmacotherapy for PD, has limitations including a short half‐life, fluctuations in efficacy, and dyskinesias with long‐term use. There have been efforts to develop complementary and alternative therapies for incurable PD. Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional herbal medicine that is widely used for treating neurosis, insomnia, and night crying in children. The clinical efficacy of YKS for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and impaired agitation/aggression subscale and activities of daily living scores, has mainly been investigated in the context of neurological disorders such as PD, Alzheimer’s disease, and other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, YKS has previously been found to improve clinical symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments, pain, and tardive dyskinesia. Preclinical studies have reported that the broad efficacy of YKS for various symptoms involves its regulation of neurotransmitters including GABA, serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as the expression of dynamin and glutamate transporters, and changes in glucocorticoid hormones and enzymes such as choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, YKS has neuroprotective effects at various cellular levels via diverse mechanisms. In this review, we focus on the clinical efficacy and neuropharmacological effects of YKS. We discuss the possible mechanisms underpinning the effects of YKS on neuropathology and suggest that the multiple actions of YKS may be beneficial as a treatment for PD. We highlight the potential that YKS may serve as a complementary and alternative strategy for the treatment of PD.",

      "title": "Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Cannabis withdrawal is a well‐characterized phenomenon that occurs in approximately half of regular and dependent cannabis users after abrupt cessation or significant reductions in cannabis products that contain Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This review describes the diagnosis, prevalence, course and management of cannabis withdrawal and highlights opportunities for future clinical research. Methods Narrative review of literature. Results Symptom onset typically occurs 24–48 hours after cessation and most symptoms generally peak at days 2–6, with some symptoms lasting up to 3 weeks or more in heavy cannabis users. The most common features of cannabis withdrawal are anxiety, irritability, anger or aggression, disturbed sleep/dreaming, depressed mood and loss of appetite. Less common physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Despite limited empirical evidence, supportive counselling and psychoeducation are the first‐line approaches in the management of cannabis withdrawal. There are no medications currently approved specifically for medically assisted withdrawal (MAW). Medications have been used to manage short‐term symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sleep, nausea). A number of promising pharmacological agents have been examined in controlled trials, but these have been underpowered and positive findings not reliably replicated. Some (e.g. cannabis agonists) are used ‘off‐label’ in clinical practice. Inpatient admission for MAW may be clinically indicated for patients who have significant comorbid mental health disorders and polysubstance use to avoid severe complications. Conclusions The clinical significance of cannabis withdrawal is that its symptoms may precipitate relapse to cannabis use. Complicated withdrawal may occur in people with concurrent mental health and polysubstance use.",

      "title": "Autistic phenomena in neurotic patients 1",
      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

In general, the correct drug in a correct dose on a correct occasion should be administered to the correct patient. Since the acute withdrawal syndrome has disappeared, there is a phase with a variety of symptoms such as sleep disturbances and depressed libido. The term protracted withdrawal might be applied to this syndrome. There is a need for optimal treatment programs by combining evaluation of supportive care and pharmacotherapy. Which advantages and which disadvantages do drugs have in the short term and in the long term perspective?Is there a specific treatment that attacks dependence? It would be of importance to define the situation precisely. Also, drugs such as α-methyltyrosine, FLA-S7 and zimelidine which might cause an ignorance to ethanol are discussed, either by causing av aversion to ethanol or by extinguishing the euphoria. Alcohol-sensitizing compounds is another category of drugs, the effects of which are studied. A psychological conditioning may also contribute to a withdrawal reaction.Definitions of clinical situations should be improved in combination with an evaluation of pharmacotherapeutic approaches and supportive care.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Syncope in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Syncope is defined as a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness associated with loss of postural tone and should be differentiated from other states of altered consciousness such as cardiac arrest, coma, narcolepsy, seizures, dizziness, and vertigo. Although multiple studies have focused on the diagnostic workup and on the prognosis of patients with syncope,1-5 data on the evaluation and outcome of elderly patients are only recently being reported.6, 7 Establishing a cause of syncope is frequently difficult. There are at least three possible reasons for the inability to define a cause of syncope. One, abnormalities causing syncope are frequently episodic or isolated events and may not be found at initial evaluation. Two, the diagnostic criteria for causes of syncope may be too stringent, leading to underdiagnosis. Three, many patients evaluated after the syncopal event may not recall the details surrounding their episode. If witnesses are not present, valuable observations are lost and the cause of syncope may not be apparent. Additionally, the evaluation of syncope in the elderly is especially more difficult because the elderly often have multiple coexisting diseases, maybe taking multiple medications, and have age-related physiologic changes that can predispose to syncope. Elderly noninstitutionalized patients have on the average 3.5 chronic diseases8 including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disorders, all of which can predispose to syncope. Older patients are reported to take three times as many drugs as the general population,9 and many of these medications may make persons susceptible to syncope. Additionally, age-related physiologic changes may alter the normal homeostatic mechanisms maintaining blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Baroreceptor sensitivity decreases with age and the heart rate increase in response to upright posture, exercise, cough, and hypoxia may be blunted.10, 11 Furthermore, aging results in a diminished ability of the kidneys to conserve sodium when intake is restricted and plasma renin and aldosterone responses may be diminished in the elderly, leading to difficulties in maintaining extracellular fluid balance.12 As previously emphasized,13 multiple pathologic processes together may result in syncope in the elderly and occasionally it may be difficult to specifically assign a single entity as its cause. We have recently analyzed the data from our prospective syncope study in order to compare the diagnosis and prognosis of 210 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years; range, 60 to 90 years) to 190 younger patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 14 to 59 years).6 Patients in this study were accrued from the inpatient and outpatient services of the Presbyterian-University Hospital, Pittsburgh, from April 1981 through September 1983 and all underwent a standardized diagnostic evaluation.2, 6 In our elderly patients, as noted in Table 1, initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (EKG) were useful in assigning a diagnosis in the majority of the patients in whom a cause could be found. Furthermore, in the elderly, diagnosis assigned by electroencephalogram, carotid massage, cardiac catheterization, cerebral angiogram, and stress test were suggested by findings on the initial history and physical examination. These results in the elderly are similar to previous studies which have shown that a careful initial history and physical examination is the most important step in the evaluation of patients with syncope.1-3 Previous studies, however, have also shown that in a substantial number of patients a cause of syncope cannot be established after the initial history, physical examination, and EKG. Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring has assumed a central role in the evaluation of this group of patients. Although in our study6 arrhythmias were more frequently diagnosed, and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring more often led to a diagnosis in the elderly, there are many issues regarding the use of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring that are not resolved. First, there is poor correlation between symptoms found during monitoring and concurrent electrocardiographic findings.14-16 Symptoms of dizziness or syncope during monitoring occur in 29 to 42% of patients.14-16 We have reported that a rhythm disturbance could not be identified during 75% of symptomatic periods.15 Arrhythmias may be excluded as a cause if the patient has syncope during monitoring, but no concurrent rhythm disturbance. However, most patients do not have syncope during monitoring. Therefore, presumptions regarding the cause of syncope based on asymptomatic findings are frequently necessary because of the prognostic importance and sporadic nature of the arrhythmias. However, high prevalenece of cardiac arrhythmias has been reported in asymptomatic elderly patients. Therefore, in elderly patients with syncope, it has been difficult to be certain which arrhythmias should be considered significant indicators for a potential cause of loss of consciousness. Validation of the criteria used by different investigators will be needed with long-term follow-up using recurrence of symptoms and mortality as endpoints. Second, the optimal duration of electrocardiographic monitoring has not been determined. One study suggested that patients should be continuously monitored until the symptoms recur.17 This approach is impractical and not cost-effective. We are currently evaluating the optimal duration of monitoring in patients with syncope. Third, the yield of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring is variable, showing transient arrhythmias as a potential cause of syncope in 10 to 64% of patients.18-23 Clinical predictors are needed to help identify patients more likely to have diagnostic findings. Because of the limitations of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, electrophysiologic studies have been advocated for use in the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope.24 These studies, however, consist of invasive and expensive diagnostic tests which are useful in the evaluation of very selected subgroups of patients with syncope, such as patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause “who have underlying organic heart disease. These tests may not be practical in many elderly patients who are frail, have multiple chronic medical illnesses, and who may not be able to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. A large number of abnormalities are reported on electrophysiologic studies but the diagnostic importance of many of these in terms of a cause of syncope is not well established. Although sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia, markedly prolonged H-V interval (greater than 80 m), and markedly prolonged sinus node recovery time are important findings in patients with unexplained syncope, the clinical significance of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, mildly prolonged H-V interval or sinus node recovery time, and induction of supraventricular tachycardia is not clear. Morbidity and mortality from syncope in the elderly may be different than the young. Injury after a fall in the elderly may have important ramifications in terms of the medical and psychological well-being of the elderly. Although there are no prior studies regarding injury due to syncope, studies on falls in the elderly reveal a higher incidence of bone fractures with advancing age.25 Approximately one-third of our patients had an injury due to a fall, but falls resulted in major trauma more frequently in the elderly. Bone fractures may be more likely to occur in the elderly because of their higher prevalence of osteoporosis. In addition, if premonitory symptoms are present, younger patients may be able to react more quickly and assume a supine or sitting position to avoid a severe injury. The mortality in our study was higher in the elderly as a reflection of deaths due to many underlying illnesses such as malignancies and pneumonia.6 In addition, more deaths in the elderly resulted from cardiovascular diseases such as chronic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease. Elderly patients in our study also had a higher incidence of sudden death. A multivariate analysis of our data6 revealed that patients with a cardiovascular cause of syncope are at exceedingly high risk of mortality and sudden death regardless of age. In patients with a noncardiovascular cause of syncope or syncope of unknown origin, older age, a history of congestive heart failure, and male sex were important risk factors for mortality and sudden death. Recent studies on syncope in conjunction with our study in the elderly6 provide a framework for the evaluation of elderly patients with syncope. These studies show that a careful history and physical examination will help establish many of the causes of syncope and may suggest many of the cardiac or non-cardiac causes that require further testing for definitive diagnosis. An EKG and electrocradiographic monitoring should be done in patients in whom a cause is not found on initial history and physical examination. In selected patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause who have organic heart disease, electrophysiologic studies may provide evidence for possible cause of syncope, but further studies are needed to define the risk and benefit of this test in elderly patients. Other diagnostic tests should be used selectively. Our studies have shown that nongoal-directed use of head computed tomography scan, electroencephalogram, and glucose tolerance test establish few if any causes of syncope.1, 2, 6 Elderly patients have higher morbidity and mortality than the young. A systematic and meticulous evaluation for cause of syncope in the elderly is needed in the hope of decreasing recurrences, morbidity, and the incidence of sudden death.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

SDs specifically addressed in this chapter include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. There are general similarities among the different somatoform disorders that may help guide a healthcare provider's evaluation. There are inherent difficulties to evaluating SD patients in the emergency department (ED) which may contribute to both patient and physician discontent. Stronger treatment alliances with healthcare providers form if patients do not feel blamed for producing their unintentional symptoms. A treatment alliance can start in the ED, but ideally continues with inpatient or outpatient mental healthcare professionals or other specialists. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication have each demonstrated success in treating patients with SDs.",

According to the French law (article 222-15 modifié par la loi n° 2007-297 du 5 mars 2007), a drug-facilitated crime is defined as voluntary administration to a subject of a noxious substance with a mental or a physical effect. Victims can be highly variable, from very young children to very old people irrespective of their social status. As several practitioners (general physicians, emergency doctors, gynecologists, forensic pathologists, police forces) can be involved during the initial claims, it is often complicated to get a suitable reception after an assault. Indeed, drug-facilitated crimes not only involve sexual assaults, but also robberies with trick, workplace or sport competitions or any situation where the sedation of somebody is required (childcare, old people care homes). The most frequent active substances found in these cases include sedative pharmaceuticals (hypnotics, benzodiazepines, anti-histaminic compounds, neuroleptics) and entactogens (ecstasy, synthetic cathinones). Often, the victim's claims are too late to collect blood or urine, and therefore hair tests constitute the best approach to document drug exposure, which is mandatory during trials at criminal courts.",

      "abstract": "Surveys have identified inappropriate psychoactive drug prescribing patterns as a major problem in the care of nursing home residents. Residents without a documented history of mental illness often receive drugs intended to treat psychiatric problems. One of the greatest areas of misuse of these drugs is in the treatment of agitation in elderly demented residents. For example, although this purpose is likely the most common reason antipsychotic drugs are used in the nursing home setting, no well designed study has yet demonstrated that these agents are effective for this problem. Elderly individuals are particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of psychoactive drugs. Due to the gradual or insidious onset of some adverse effects, psychoactive drug toxicity may often be underestimated. The most serious example of a clinically underrecognized adverse effect of psychoactive drugs is tardive dyskinesia. Misinterpretation of certain nursing home residents' behaviors may lead to medication with tranquilizing drugs when other approaches may be safer and more effective. Excessive use of psychoactive drugs is not only physically harmful, but also encourages an apathetic attitude toward implementation of more humane ways of dealing with behaviorally disturbed nursing home residents.",

Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose‐response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo‐graphic factors must be taken into account.

      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

As per Aacharya Charaka Generalized Anxiety Disorder can be correlated with the Chittodwega (Excited state of mind) which is type of Manovikara (disease of mind). The contemporary management of this disease employs anxiolytics to be used in long run which is not conducive to health. As per this view cannabis stands as ‘Holy Grail’ in the treatment of anxiety or mood disorders without eliciting any anxiogenic effects even in higher dose. This is a case of 57 year old women who presented with persistent anxiety and inability to relax. Based on signs and symptoms he was diagnosed as a case of GAD according to the ICD 10 F41.1 criteria. Treatment planned was low dose of oral medical cannabis tincture. Assessment of the condition of the patient before and after the treatment was done using Hamilton’s Anxiety Rating Scale to evaluate efficacy of treatment. After the completion of schedule of 3 month of treatment, a significant reduction in score from 20 to 12 on Hamilton’s Anxiety Rating Scale and improvement in symptoms was observed.",

      "abstract": "The selective serotonin-1A receptor partial agonist anxiolytics represent a new class of pharmacologic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These compounds offer a completely different pharmacologic approach to this disorder from previous medications. The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) anxiolytics buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, and SM-3997 have several important new and unique features that will be reviewed in this paper. These features include no cross-tolerance with alcohol or benzodiazepines, no evidence of abuse or misuse potential, and no withdrawal symptoms or rebound anxiety on cessation of therapy. The 5-HT1A anxiolytics have no muscle relaxant, sedative, or anticonvulsant properties and do not impair psychomotor functioning. They do have a slower onset of effect than standard benzodiazepines – clinical response is usually noted in 1–3 weeks. The side effect profile is quite different from that of the benzodiazepines. It includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and restlessness. Some patients with GAD who have received chronic ( > 1 month) benzodiazepine therapy may not respond as well to these compounds initially as will patients with no prior benzodiazepine treatment, especially if the benzodiazepine has been discontinued only recently. These compounds, buspirone in particular, have been shown to have excellent maintenance and prophylactic properties and to be well tolerated with long-term therapy ( > 3 months). Because of their unique mechanism of action and side effect profile, and no evidence of misuse or abuse potential or interference with mental acuity, these compounds represent a definite advance in the pharmacologic management of GAD.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Pruritus ist ein häufiges und quälendes Symptom in der Bevölkerung sowie in ärztlichen Praxen. Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "abstract": "Many of the nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease have a dopaminergic basis, whether the result of dopaminergic degeneration or as a result of dopaminergic treatment. In the latter case, the symptoms may be genuine side effects of drugs (hypotension, pathologic gambling, etc.) or they may be secondary either to the pathoplastic effect they have on the natural course of the disease (nonmotor fluctuations) or to the lack of dopamine (apathy, depression, dopamine withdrawal syndrome, etc.). In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful. However, many other nonmotor (and motor) symptoms will have no correlation with dopamine; therefore, they require different treatments, very often with little efficacy, as in apathy or cognitive decline.",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "abstract": "Delirium can be conceptualized as an acute decline in cognitive function that typically lasts from hours to a few days. Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

This prescription should remain as simple as possible and the association of other psychotropic drugs should not be systematic. Optimal doses should be reached rapidly but the therapeutic efficacy will only become obvious after 2-4 weeks and complete after 6-8 weeks. As most antidepressants display a similar therapeutic efficacy, the choice will depend on tolerability, patient characteristics and the result of previous therapeutic attempts. Prescribing an antidepressant requires a thorough supervision and repeated visits during the first weeks of treatment.

      "abstract": "Abstract While addiction is a familiar term, it lacks a precise technical definition. Theories of addiction differ as to whether addiction is seen as a unique form of habit or only as a habit that is particularly strong . Traditionally, habit has been associated with the concept of reinforcement, and most drugs that are claimed to be addictive for humans have been shown to be reinforcers in animal models. The primary theoretical disagreements have to do with the issue of physical dependence; classical dependence theories hold that a drug‐taking habit only becomes an addiction when the frequency of use establishes autonomic and metabolic adaptations such that drug intake becomes required for normal homeostatic function. In this view drug intake becomes compulsive because the addict needs the drug to self‐medicate withdrawal distress. Physical dependence, readily demonstrated in the case of opiates and other depressant drugs, is associated with drug tolerance such that increasing doses are required to “self‐medicate” the autonomic distress that results from drug detoxification. However, classic dependence signs are absent in the case of the psychomotor stimulants cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine; indeed, withdrawal from these drugs has effects generally opposite to opiate and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Nonetheless, self‐administration of these substances can be as compulsive as—and more physiologically harmful than—self‐administration of opiates. Thus alternatives to dependence theory have stressed the role of drugs as powerful reinforcers, reinforcers that can elevate mood state above normal levels and can establish or reinstate compulsive drug‐seeking habits even in nondependent subjects. The brain mechanisms involved in foraging for and ingesting addictive drugs are much the same as those involved in more natural motivated behaviors such as foraging for and engaging food or sexual partners. Thus such habits such as compulsive eating, compulsive sexual behavior, and compulsive gambling are increasingly labeled addictions. Recent brain imaging studies support the view that drug addiction shares common mechanisms with these other compulsive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

      "abstract": "La pratica della contenzione degli anziani dementi, non autosufficienti, con problemi cognitivi e di comportamento si attua con modalita fisiche o chimiche. La contenzione fisica, come implica la definizione, sono le modalita che limitano i movimenti dell’ospite e non possono essere da lui facilmente rimossi. Si ha la contenzione chimica, quando farmaci tranquillanti, sedativi e antidepressivi sono usati senza indicazioni adeguate o per periodi eccessivi di tempo. Nelle istituzioni geriatriche il ricorso al loro uso sembra essere eccessivo, gli ospiti anziani sono spesso in contenzione senza una chiara direttiva medica e per motivazioni non sempre corrette. Da un esame della letteratura e dell’esperienza clinica, gli Autori evidenziano come i mezzi di contenzione non solo non raggiungono quei risultati previsti nelle motivazioni addotte per il loro uso, ma possono comportare effetti collaterali dannosi quale la diminuzione del tono muscolare, ulcere da pressione, disturbi circolari, e anche la morte. Da un punto di vista etico legare l’ospite anziano assume costantemente connotazioni negative e suggerisce sempre privazioni di autonomia, annullamento della persona. Se e quando la contenzione deve essere adottata, questo deve avvenire dopo che si siano esaminati tutti gli interventi alternativi possibili, e deve essere sempre prescritta da un medico ed accuratamente registrata sia per la modalita usata la meno coercitiva possibile che per il tempo che si rende necessaria. Se ne dovrebbero considerare le indicazioni, le controindicazioni, l’efficacia e la sicurezza, gli effetti indesiderati esattamente come si fa con un farmaco o con un\r\nintervento chirurgico. Una politica di riduzione al ricorso generalizzato ai mezzi di contenzione deve essere considerata nell’ambito di una prospettiva assistenziale che favorisca una migliore formazione degli operatori, e tenga conto di fattori clinici, fattori spirituali e psicosociali, fattori riabilitativi, fattori ambientali.",

      "abstract": "Smoking is slow poison which could be the cause of death for all its users.\r\nThe cause of dependence to smoking is due to the presence of nicotine other then nicotine\r\ncommercially marketed cigarettes contain many chemical compounds which results in\r\nvarious diseases like cancer, COPD, ischemic cardiac disorders, renal and hepatic\r\ndysfunction ,oxidative stress and also causes impairment of memory and condition\r\nprogresses additional cognitive abilities or impact. Abstinence syndrome is major cue for\r\nsmoking\r\nAs per the previous studies of plant materials(active constituents )used in the\r\nformulation of Banico Emulsion conclude that the active constituents can deplitiate the\r\nsomatic and non-somatic signs appeared in abstinence syndrome and indirectly decreease\r\nthe dependence to nicotine. The somatic signs are assessed observing the animals directly\r\nduring the dependence and abstinence syndrome period and concluded whether the animals\r\nare recovered by the treatment with Banico Emulsion. The non-somatic signs are assessed\r\nby using various different parameters namely actophotometer, elevated zero maze, marble\r\nburying method , morris water maze and rotarod\r\nOverall withdrawal symptoms appeared to meetall the stated criteria for nicotine\r\nabstinence syndrome. signs appeared far more frequently after 16-24 hours after the\r\ntermination of both NHT and CS in their respective methods. The frequency of signs were\r\nfar greater in previously induced rats than in contol animals. Abstinence signs were\r\nsignificantly decreased with the treatment of banico emulsion.sharp transient decrease in\r\nactivity provide additional evidence to differentiate the dependence, absitnence and\r\nrecovery period.\r\nActophotometer is the parameter to assess the locomotor activity and anhedonia\r\nduring the Dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. Normal rat are\r\nexpected to exhibit an locomotor percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected\r\nproduce increased locomoter activity due to euphoria during the dependence period\r\nfollowed by decreased locomotor activity during withdrawal period due to the decrease in\r\ndopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain. According to the animals which were either NHT or CS induced increased depression due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with Banico Emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased locomator activity and decreased stress of the animals.\r\nElevated zero maze is the parameter to assess the conditioned fear during the\r\ndependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. The ability to alternate requires\r\nthat the rat know which arm they have already visited.Normal rat are expected to exhibit an\r\nalteration percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected produce increased due to\r\neuphoria during the dependence period followed by decreased alteration during withdrawal\r\nperiod due to the decrease in dopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain.\r\nAccording to the animals which were either NHT or CS induced increased depression due\r\nto the termination of nicotine in withdrawal period. but animals treated with banico\r\nemulsion produced a significant decrease in a conditioned fear which was comparable to\r\nthe untreated control which in turn indicates the increased alteration and decreased\r\nirritability or confusion of the animals.\r\nMorris water maze task represents more specific for spatial learning and memory.\r\nThe essential feature of this technique is that rats are placed into large circular pool of\r\nwater and can escape into a hidden platform. Thus, the platform offers no local cues to\r\nguide escape behavior and the rat can escape from swimming by climbing on to the\r\nplatform apparently learns the spatial location of the platform any starting position at the\r\ncircumference of the pool. The only spatial cues are those outside water tank are primarily\r\nvisual cues. Thus, the versatility of the task makes it a widely acceptable experimental\r\nmodel for the assessment of cognitive tests. Typically, the induced animals exhibited a\r\ndecrease time for escape latency during dependence period followed by an increase time\r\nfor escape latency indicating loss of visual cues to escape n to the platform during\r\nwithdrawal period. Such a diminished cognition was reversed by the administration of the\r\nBanico Emulsion at the specified dosage levels and exhibited escape latency (EL),\r\nindicating the well- developed spatial memory in spite of NHT or CS induced abstinence\r\nsyndrome. Marble burying behavior is the parameter to assess the anxiety related behavior\r\nduring the dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. Normal rat are\r\nexpected to bury marble upto percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected produce\r\nincreased burying of marbles due to euphoria during the dependence period followed by\r\ndecreased burying of marbles during withdrawal period due to the decrease in dopamine,\r\nnor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain. According to the animals which were either\r\nNHT or CS induced increased burying of marbles due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with Banico Emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased burying of marbles and decreased anxiety of the animals.\r\nRotarod is the parameter to assess the muscle contraction property and\r\ntremors(somatic sign) during the dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period.\r\nNormal rat are expected to exhibit an musle fall off time 50-60 seconds . The induced rats\r\nare expected produce increased fall off time due to euphoria during the dependence period\r\nfollowed by decreased fall off time during withdrawal period due to the decrease in\r\ndopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain.According to the animals which\r\nwere either NHT or CS induced increased fall off time due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with banico emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased fall off time and decreased tremors of the animals.\r\nnAchr's receptors are involved in cognitive and memory functions and several\r\nstudies have suggested their roles in dependence. Marked cholinergic deficit is a hallmark\r\nof the pathogenesis of smoking dependence and various drugs including NRT and nicotine\r\nblockade therapy have designed to target abstinence syndrome but failed to delpetiate\r\ndependence to either nicotine or other drugs. There was a significant elevation in the level\r\ndopamine, nor-epinephrine and serotonine\r\nPrevious studies concluded that anti oxidant property like SOD and GSHPx\r\n(glutathione peroxidase) in the animals treat the dependence and abstinence syndrome of\r\ncigarette smoking . It has been suggested that antioxidant might contribute to the prevention of dependence and abstinence syndrome. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)\r\nconstitutes a mutually supportive team of defense against reactive oxygen species. The\r\nmost remarkable effect of banico emulsion is increased activity of SOD in hippocampus.\r\nTreatment with banico emulsion preserved the reduced SOD to that of the normal control.\r\nGlutathione (GSH) is the major non-protein thiol antioxidant in mammalian cells\r\nand is considered the main intracellular redox buffer. GSH protects cellular protein thiols\r\nagainst irreversible loss, thus preserving protein function The administration of banico\r\nemulsion significantly preserved the activity of GSH, GPx in the hippocampus to similar\r\nlevel observed in normal control mice. The restoration of activities of GSH, GPx banico\r\nemulsion might promote scavenging of free radicals using recycled GSH from GSSG .CONCLUSION: The new methodology of inducing the cigarette smoke induced similar dependence\r\nand abstinence Syndrome when compared with the standard method of NHT induce\r\nDependence and abstinence Syndrome method. The new method induced the other\r\nCarcinogenic and Oxidative stress effects on all Body Parts.\r\nThe selected dose 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg of banico emulsion showed significant\r\naction on nicotine dependence and abstinence Syndrome but higher dose 400mg/kg showed\r\nbetter action than lower dose 200mg/kg.\r\nThe present study relieved the action of Banico Emulsion on nicotine hydrogen\r\ntartarate and cigarette smoke induced Nicotine Dependence and Abstinence Syndrome in\r\nSD rats. From the results it can be concluded that Banico Emulsion had remarkable effect\r\nin Abstinence Syndrome which is followed by reduced Nicotine Dependence. Further\r\nstudies are required for the identification of molecular level action and individual\r\nphytoconstitutent on depletion action.",

      "title": "Recommendation for the assessment of tobacco craving and withdrawal in smoking cessation trials",
      "abstract": "This paper addresses methodological issues in the assessment of nicotine withdrawal and craving in clinical trials of smoking cessation therapies. We define withdrawal as a syndrome of behavioral, affective, cognitive, and physiological symptoms, typically transient, emerging upon cessation or reduction of tobacco use and causing distress or impairment of behavioral function. Offset effects (effects related to removal of a direct nicotine effect) are sustained effects of cessation or reduction of tobacco use that cause distress or impairment. Withdrawal and craving are important as potential predictors of relapse, as mediators and markers of treatment effects, and as clinical phenomena in their own right. Symptoms recommended for assessment include craving, irritability, depression, restlessness, sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, and weight gain; anxiety deserves further study. We recommend reporting of data on each of these individual symptoms, and use of multiple-item assessments. Although some standardized measures of withdrawal have promising psychometric properties, no measure has yet fully established its reliability, validity, and broad applicability and, therefore, we do not currently favor universal adoption of any one measure. Assessment of objective indices of withdrawal (e.g., hormonal changes) is currently technically challenging and of unknown value. Although weekly assessment may suffice in some large trials, more intensive measurement can provide better sensitivity. Analyses of withdrawal should include baseline measures and be sensitive to potential instability in baseline. Analytic approaches should take into account potential bias when only abstinent subjects are examined. Conversely, heterogeneity should be considered when smoking subjects are included in intent-to-treat analyses. Withdrawal data from clinical trials focused on assessing abstinence rates may be biased because of progressive subject loss to dropout and relapse; different designs and approaches are needed to investigate the process and natural history of craving and withdrawal.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

In the majority of palliative care patients, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial and the most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue and history and investigations should always be individualized. Management should initially aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes; however, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered. For optimal management the multidimensional components of fatigue should be assessed and future research is needed on the use of non-pharmacological treatment such as physical activity, counselling, and/or pharmacological agents such as a trial of psychostimulants or short course of corticosteroids.",

It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

Libido may be decreased by drugs that block dopamine or testosterone, or that cause dysphoria. Erection may be decreased by drugs that divert blood flow from the penis, or drugs that affect spinal reflexes. Ganglion blockers may also inhibit erection. Ejaculation may be diminished by drugs that affect spinal reflexes or be inhibited by ganglion blockage. Enervation of the vas deferens and epididymis may be blocked and cause a smaller emission. Retrograde ejaculation may occur due to blockage of the internal urethral sphincter. Orgasm is usually inhibited by the drugs that inhibit ejaculation. Fertility is impaired by drugs that affect sexual performance or spermatogenesis. Major groups of drugs that may affect male sexual function include drugs of abuse, CNS depressants, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, psychotherapeutics, hormones, and cancer therapeutics, in addition to miscellaneous other agents. Information about these drugs has been arranged in tables so that the provider has a convenient reference to use when explaining to men the effect of drugs on sexual response and fertility.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Research has shown that eating disorder (ED) patients who abuse substances demonstrate worse ED symptomatology and poorer outcomes than those with EDs alone, including increased general medical complications and psychopathology, longer recovery times, poorer functional outcomes and higher relapse rates. This article provides a broad overview of the prevalence, aetiology, assessment and management of co-morbid EDs and substance use disorders (SUDs). Review The co-occurrence of EDs and SUDs is high. The functional relationship between EDs and SUDs vary within and across ED subtypes, depends on the class of substance, and needs to be carefully assessed for each patient. Substances such as caffeine, tobacco, insulin, thyroid medications, stimulants or over the counter medications (laxatives, diuretics) may be used to aid weight loss and/or provide energy, and alcohol or psychoactive substances could be used for emotional regulation or as part of a pattern of impulsive behaviour. A key message conveyed in the current literature is the importance of screening and assessment for co-morbid SUDs and EDs in patients presenting with either disorder. There is a paucity of treatment studies on the management of co-occurring EDs and SUDs. Overall, the literature indicates that the ED and SUD should be addressed simultaneously using a multi-disciplinary approach. The need for medical stabilization, hospitalization or inpatient treatment needs to be assessed based on general medical and psychiatric considerations. Common features across therapeutic interventions include psycho-education about the aetiological commonalities, risks and sequelae of concurrent ED behaviours and substance abuse, dietary education and planning, cognitive challenging of eating disordered attitudes and beliefs, building of skills and coping mechanisms, addressing obstacles to improvement and the prevention of relapse. Emphasis should be placed on building a collaborative therapeutic relationship and avoiding power struggles. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been frequently used in the treatment of co-morbid EDs and SUDs, however there are no randomized controlled trials. More recently evidence has been found for the efficacy of dialectical behavioural therapy in reducing both ED and substance use behaviours. Conclusion Future research would benefit from a meta-analysis of the current research in order to better understand the relationships between these two commonly co-occurring disorders.",

Somatoform disorders, which used to be considered as mental disorders, are frequent, especially in the context of non-psychiatric medical consultations. The absence of an identifiable organic cause for these disorders often leads clinicians to underestimates their harmful consequences or even challenge their validity as disease. However, they are real disorders that may have a major impact on the quality of life and functional outcomes of the subject and whose mechanisms can be targeted by therapeutic interventions. Although psychiatric classifications support a unitary approach (i.e. the \"somatic symptom disorder and related disorders\" of the American Psychiatric Association's DSM - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - or the \"bodily distress disorder\" of the World Health Organization), each non-psychiatric specialty has described some \"functional somatic syndromes\", which are deemed more specific and less severe regarding psychiatric severity, and thus more often remain in the field of non-psychiatric specialties. In this article, we have presented the initial stage of any medical approach of suffering: a clarification of the issues involved in the delimitation of the normal and the pathological, and the organization of the different categories between them. These nosographic aspects are the condition of a rigorous approach in medicine, and of a relationship with the patient that is useful to understand and relieve his or her genuine suffering.Définition des troubles somatoformes : entre symptômes physiques et symptômes mentaux.

Il s’agit pourtant de troubles à part entière, avec un impact majeur sur la qualité de vie et les activités des sujets en souffrant et avec des mécanismes accessibles à la thérapeutique. Si la nosographie psychiatrique contemporaine privilégie une approche unitaire (« troubles à symptomatologie somatique et apparentés » du Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux, « bodily distress disorder » de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé), chaque spécialité a décrit un ou plusieurs « syndromes somatiques fonctionnels » qui, du fait de leur spécificité présumée et de leur sévérité psychiatrique moins grande, restent le plus souvent du domaine des spécialités non psychiatriques. Dans cet article est présentée l’étape initiale à toute approche médicale de la souffrance : une clarification des enjeux de la définition du normal et du pathologique et de l’organisation des différentes catégories nosographiques entre elles. Ces aspects nosographiques sont la condition d’une approche rigoureuse en médecine et d’une relation avec le patient qui soit utile à la compréhension et au soulagement de sa souffrance.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking behaviour and consumption, loss of control in limiting consumption and drug dependence typified by withdrawal symptoms when access to the drug is denied. An overviewof the background and our current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin substance abuse and addiction is provided in this chapter. The findings from neurobiological studies suggest that the initial response to addictive substances activate both 'liking' (hedonic) and 'wanting' hotspots in the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, provoking both the pleasurable effects and the desire to continue taking such agents. People who are dependent on alcohol will display withdrawal symptoms on abrupt cessation of drinking or significant reductions in intake. The withdrawal symptoms include nausea, emesis, tremor, tachycardia, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and transitory hallucinations.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Boredom, restlessness, chronic ill-defined tension, and impulsiveness characterize many long-term drug-using adolescents between highs. The impulsive, pleasure-seeking, drug-using adolescent is often unable to delay immediate gratification for future reward, and his tolerance to frustration is very low. Academic underachievement and his tolerance to frustration is very low. Academic underachievement and intense loneliness, despite outward signs of feeling at ease, may be manifestations of a poor sense of self-worth, of apathy, and of lack of motivation that the adolescent has sought to alleviate by escaping to a drug-induced euphoric state. These feelings may also be manifested in anger toward loved ones, school, and society that intensifies as addiction progresses. Such adolescents may be brought into the pediatrician's office because they are apathetic, lethargic, volatile, chronically moody, failing in school, disrespectful, untrustworthy,",

      "title": "Disorders relating to the use of ecstasy and other ‘party drugs’",
      "abstract": "Abstract MDMA, methamphetamine, GHB, and ketamine are all capable of producing acute adverse psychological experiences in normal users and exacerbating symptoms in those with underlying psychological disorders. They also to varying degrees pose the risk of long-term neuropsychiatric consequences. Although dependent patterns of use are not commonly seen with this group of drugs, methamphetamines certainly can result in the very rapid development of severe dependence. Most acute presentations are typically short-lived and self-limiting and are only very rarely life-threatening. The precipitation of an underlying psychiatric disorder or an exacerbation of premorbid traits may well be one of the longer term consequences of heavy use of these drugs. In those who present with acute drug-related psychological symptoms there should be an emphasis on follow-up since in some cases the symptoms will represent the onset of a persistent independent disorder which requires treatment. Users who have experienced acute psychological problems should be encouraged to make the attribution that there may be something inherent in them that makes them susceptible to experiencing the unpleasant reactions with a drug and that they are likely to remain vulnerable to those adverse experiences. This may be difficult to accept for potentially vulnerable young people who may prefer to think that the experience was not enjoyable because the drugs were not good – ‘it was a bad pill’.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

      "title": "Unrecognized medical disorders among older patients in psychiatric emergency service",
      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergency services (PESs) are pivotal in geriatric health care, as the number of elderly with psychiatric illnesses is on the rise (Woo, 2009). Older patients admitted to psychiatric acute settings often have one or more unrecognized medical disorders that may reflect either a new medical illness or an exacerbation of chronic medical disorders (Woo et al., 2003). Also, the clinical presentations of elderly in psychiatric emergencies are further complicated by substance misuse and iatrogenic causes (Chan et al., 2009). This study examined the prevalence of unrecognized medical disorders among older patients presented to the only PES in a county of 800 000 inhabitants on involuntary psychiatric holds. Under California law, a person may be held involuntarily for 72 h for psychiatric assessment if one is deemed a danger to self, to others, or gravely disabled. A person is brought to the attention of PES for suffering from a psychiatric illness. At the time of initial presentation to the PES, all patients received a comprehensive assessment that included a medical clearance. As psychiatric inpatient setting may only treat acute psychiatric patients with general medical needs, those requiring intensive medical workup would be admitted to medical unit for further treatment. During the 2-year study period (2006–2007), there were 6018 involuntary evaluations. There were 104 patients aged 65 and above. The sample had the following demographic characteristics: gender = 58% (n = 60) female, ethnicity = 59% (n = 61) Caucasian, insurance = 26% (n = 27) with no insurance, and mean age (SD) = 72.4 (8.1) years. The most common Axis I diagnoses were psychosis (n = 28) and depression (n = 27). Nineteen patients had comorbid dementia. A total of 93% (n = 97) had at least one chronic medical illness. And after medical clearance, 19% (n = 20) of the 104 patients were admitted to the medical floor from the PES. Table 1 summarized the primary admitting diagnosis for each of the 20 patients. This study highlights the significance of medical disorders in older patients with psychiatric emergencies. It is important to note that 93% of the cohort had at least one chronic medical disorder. Medical illnesses often exacerbate psychiatric symptoms, lead to functional decline, and prolong psychiatric hospitalization (Lyketsos et al., 2002). This study also suggests that thorough medical evaluations must be performed on older patients presented to the PES. Nineteen percent of the cohort who were brought to the PES may not have primary psychiatric illness but previously unrecognized medical disorders producing or exacerbating the psychiatric presentations. Geropsychiatric emergencies include substance abuse, elder abuse, iatrogenic causes, geriatric depression, and suicide, as well as behavioral disturbance secondary to underlying organic conditions (Borja et al., 2007). In our study, infections (i.e., pneumonia, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract infections) accounted for 25% of all organic conditions disguised as psychiatric emergencies that result in admission to the medical unit. On top of providing timely psychiatric care to elderly patients on involuntary psychiatric holds, PES also serves to provide quality emergency care by screening for acute medical conditions. It is possible that by treating the acute medical conditions, the initial presentation of behavioral disturbances may be minimized or even eliminated. In summary, geropsychiatric patients are more likely to be medically ill, and physicians must have a high vigilance for unrecognized medical disorders in elderly patients with behavioral disturbances. Medical illnesses often exacerbate psychiatric symptoms, lead to functional decline, and prolong psychiatric hospitalization. 19% of the cohort who were brought to the PES may not have primary psychiatric illness but previously unrecognized medical disorders producing or exacerbating the psychiatric presentations.",

A principal manifestation of their self-regulation disturbances is evident in the way they attempt to self-medicate painful affect states and related psychiatric problems. Individuals select a particular drug based on its ability to relieve or augment emotions unique to an individual which they cannot achieve or maintain on their own. Addicts and alcoholics usually experiment with all classes of drugs, but discover that a particular drug suits them best. Usually, painful affect states interact with other problems in self-regulation involving self-esteem, relationships, self-care, and related characterological defenses, making it more likely that addicts will experiment with and find the action of a particular drug appealing or compelling. Stimulants have their appeal because their energizing properties relieve distress associated with depression, hypomania, and hyperactivity; opiates are compelling because they mute and contain disorganizing affects of rage and aggression; and sedative hypnotics, including alcohol, permit the experience of affection, aggression, and closeness in individuals who are otherwise cut off from their feelings and relationships.",

It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

      "title": "Psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in “Long <scp>COVID</scp> ”: the relevance of immunopsychiatry",
      "abstract": "Although precise estimations of the absolute risk are still difficult to provide, it is clear that depression and anxiety are predominant symptoms in post-acute COVID-19, and that they are more pronounced in patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19 than in those hospitalized for other respiratory tract infections1. Also, cognitive impairment has been reported in several people who have had symptomatic COVID-19 infection, which can manifest as difficulties with concentration, memory, receptive language and/or executive function1. Psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment can develop and persist months after the infection and are therefore part of what is called the \"Long COVID\" condition, of which fatigue is another paramount manifestation. The development of depression and anxiety symptoms and of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 may partly be the result of somatic, functional or psychosocial consequences of the disease. Coronaviruses can also induce cognitive, emotional, neurovegetative and behavioral dysregulation due to direct neurological injury through hypoxic damage and neuroinvasion. In addition to this, the systemic immune activation seen in COVID-19 can contribute significantly to the mental health toll even months after the initial disease. COVID-19 disease has been characterized as a cytokine release syndrome2. Elevated serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and other inflammatory cytokines are hallmarks, and correlate in a dose-response manner with respiratory failure, adverse respiratory distress syndrome, and other clinical outcomes. Immuno-inflammatory dysregulation can contribute importantly to acute and post-acute psychiatric and cognition symptoms in COVID-19 patients. To illustrate, various lines of research indicate a link between immune activation and depression. First, manipulation of the immune system through endotoxin, interferon-alpha or typhoid vaccine interventions induces sickness behavior involving depressive symptoms such as fatigue, low mood and hypersomnia. Second, large-scale studies confirmed that persons with auto-immune conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, or with inflammation-inducing conditions, e.g. obesity, have an increased risk to subsequently develop depression. Third, meta-analyses of biomarker studies indicate that levels of inflammatory markers, including cytokines – such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 – and acute phase proteins – such as C-reactive protein (CRP) – are significantly elevated in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. Low-grade systemic inflammation has also been shown to induce robust pathophysiological abnormalities in the endocrine systems of stress and arousal regulation that further augment neuroimmune reactivity. In addition, human and animal studies indicate that peripheral immune activation is able to induce brain inflammation, and increased inflammatory responses have been indeed reported in post-mortem brain samples of depressed individuals. Moreover, large-scale genome-wide DNA and RNA studies indicate that depressed persons have more genetic variants and enriched gene expression pathways involved in immune signaling. Such genetic pleiotropy between immuno-inflammatory dysregulation and depression may indicate a genetic vulnerabil­ity that might partly explain why persons with a mood disorder history have a higher risk of unfavorable COVID-19 disease outcomes as compared to persons without a psychiatric history3. Fi­nally, anti-inflammatory medication approaches have demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression symptoms. Of note, findings suggesting a pathophysiological link to the immune system have also been reported for other dimensions relevant to COVID-19, such as cognitive impairment and fatigue. In a population-representative cross-sectional analysis of >40,000 adults, a higher CRP level was associated with poorer executive functioning, which was especially true in the presence of depression and even existed in early adulthood4. Longitudinally, high levels of inflammatory markers have been linked to long-term cognitive decline, involving deterioration of memory and executive function5. A proteome-wide association study of older-adult brain donors indicated increased inflammation in brains of cognitively impaired persons as compared to those of cognitive stable persons6. For fatigue, illustration of immune system involvement comes most strongly from studies of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), a condition characterized by persistent, unexplained fatigue that is not alleviated by rest. Although CFS/ME has long been indicated as a mystery illness, recent studies suggest that inflammation is central to its pathogenesis in at least a considerable proportion of patients, as suggested by higher levels of inflammatory markers that show a dose-response relationship to disease severity7. If even low-grade systemic immune activity increases the risk of depression, cognitive impairment and fatigue, it is obvious that we need to be aware of the role that immune activation can play in the mental health consequences of COVID-19, which involves a massive cytokine storm. A dose-response relationship has been indeed documented between the severity of immune-inflammatory dysregulation in COVID-19 patients and depressive symptomatology three months later8. The same study also reported that high baseline inflammation load in COVID-19 patients predicted neurocognitive impairment – involving reduced processing speed, verbal memory and fluency – after three months. How long the impact of immune activation in COVID-19 patients persists remains to be clarified. However, for infections involving hospital contact, the maximum behavioral effects can take over a year post-infection to fully develop. This suggests that, next to the immediate impact, there may also be priming whereby immune activation triggered by infection (i.e., first hit) may progressively increase sensitivity to common pro-inflammatory stimuli (i.e., second hit), which include other mild infections, concussions, airborne allergen and pollutant exposure, as well as psychosocial stressors. Future research goals are to examine how to best monitor, prevent and treat psychiatric, behavioral and cognitive consequences of COVID-19. For clinicians treating depression in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a thorough history and clinical examination are paramount. There is evidence that immune-inflammatory dysregulation is limiting the efficacy of antidepressants, as high plasma levels of CRP and interleukins have been found to be predictors of poor treatment response9. Consequently, whether antidepressants are effective in treating COVID-19-related depression deserves specific confirmation. In the meantime, we can assume that any major advances in vaccines and antiviral treatments targeting SARS-CoV-2, as well as immune targeted therapies (such as anti-cytokines and cytokine receptor blockers), will not only prevent severe illness but also benefit the brain and mental health.",

Fourteen had clouded states, which were found to be transitory obscurings of consciousness of varying depths, developing some years after seizures first began, usually occurring after several successive convulsions, characterized nearly always by overactivity, by variable speech abnormalities, wide variations of mood, visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions, disorientation, poor recent memory, defective judgment, and little or no insight. In some cases, the content of the psychosis could be partly traced to earlier factors in the patient's lives. The clouded states were compared to alcoholic pathological intoxication. Three had chronic psychoses resembling schizophrenia. One other was considerably deteriorated. The rest were unclassified. The neuropathological processes underlying these conditions are unknown. The clouded states contribute to the study of psychopathology. Psychotherapy might be of some value. There is great need of research in this almost untouched field.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

Contrary to what was expected it turned out that particularly three factors correlate positively with a speedy admission to psychotherapy.

      "abstract": "Attention deficit disorder may persist into adult life and have a genetic basis\n\nA behavioural syndrome of childhood characterised by overactivity, excitability, and explosive behaviour has been recognised since the turn of the last century and is now thought to be, at certain ages, the most common disorder of childhood.1 The disorder is now recognised in the terminology of ICD-102 as “hyperkinetic disorder”, and in DSM-IV3 as “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder” (AD/HD). The cardinal features of overactivity and impaired attention should be pervasive—that is, evident in more than one situation, and observable before the age of six (ICD-10) or seven years (DSM-IV), though they are usually evident well before that. DSM-IV subclassifies AD/HD into predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive–impulsive, and combined subtypes; ICD-10 insists on the presence of both inattention and hyperactivity for a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder.\n\nThe prevalence varies according to which set of diagnostic criteria is used, DSM-IV or the more restrictive ICD-10. Using the latter, prevalence in the United Kingdom is 1.5% among seven year old boys in British inner cities4; in the USA using DSM-IV criteria, this may rise as high as 9.5%.5 Sex differences are far more consistently reported, and boys regularly exceed girls in a ratio of 2.5:1. There is a substantial comorbidity with conduct disorder and oppositional deviant disorder, although the two conditions are not readily separated, and with reading disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, multiple tic disorder, and Tourette’s syndrome.\n\nThe hyperactive child syndrome as it was originally conceived was thought to be a condition of childhood. Experienced clinicians could write: “In later years this syndrome tends to wane spontaneously and disappear. We have not seen it persist in those patients we have followed to adult life.”6 This view was widespread and was formally acknowledged in …",

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder may kick and flail, scream, fall out of bed, or engage in complex behavior that emerges from the content of their vivid, fearful dreams. Patients usually seek help only after they have injured themselves or their bed partners during sleep. Serious physical injury is possible. Often REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the use of psychotropic medication or with a definable underlying neurological disorder. In an acute form of REM sleep behavior disorder, there is a more sudden onset of symptoms as a consequence of a toxic or abnormal metabolic state, including alcohol withdrawal, or in association with the use or discontinuation of psychotropic medications.",

Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of bipolar disorder is essential for clinical decision making and determining prognosis and treatments.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "title": "THE MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANCE IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "In the general population, presence of a mood disorder increases the odds of a substance use disorder.71 Substance use and abuse is common in psychiatric patients, and depressive syndromes are common in patients seeking treatment for substance abuse.1, 89 Aside from their common co-occurrence, there are at least three sets of reasons to focus on clinically when treating the combination of substance use and depression: Substances, through their acute and chronic effects, may worsen depression and contribute to treatment resistance. DSM-IV lists either substance-induced mood, anxiety, or sleep disorders as resulting from practically every class of addictive substances.2 Thus, substance use could either worsen or account entirely for a treatment-resistant depressive syndrome. Depression may worsen the severity of substance use, increasing its deleterious effects over time. It has been shown consistently that patients with both depression and substance use syndromes have a poorer prognosis along various domains of outcome. * In particular the combination of depression and substance abuse increases the risk of suicide.42, 51 Substance use disorder in a depressive patient may point the way to other, previously unappreciated psychopathologic conditions that may contribute to treatment resistance. In the general population, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders are more strongly associated with substance abuse than is depression.71 These have specific treatment indications, mood stabilizers and various nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety regimens, 55 which might improve outcome in previously treatment-resistant cases. For example, buspirone has been shown to improve outcome in alcoholics with generalized anxiety symptoms.40 Explosive irritable mood in substance abusers may benefit from mood stabilizers, even in the absence of clear-cut bipolar disorder.21, 22 Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a well-established risk factor for substance abuse and also is associated with depression.9, 10, 11, 24, 35 Such patients might benefit from antidepressant agents with demonstrated efficacy against ADD, such as desipramine or bupropion.4, 8, 12 Alcohol and other substances may cause dementia syndromes with associated mood symptoms, 34 which would suggest further neurologic and medical evaluation. The development of recommendations for treatment-resistant depression in patients with substance abuse or dependence is complicated by three issues: (1) Two domains of outcome are involved—substance use symptoms and mood symptoms; (2) Diagnostic uncertainty surrounds depressive symptoms in the setting of ongoing substance use; and (3) There is a relative lack of empiric studies on treatment of depression in substance abusers. An empiric base is beginning to accumulate on the initial treatment of depression in substance abusers, and this is reviewed in this article. There are no systematic studies to date on treatment-resistant depression in these patients. Illustrative cases are presented from the authors' clinical experience that suggest general principles and directions for future research.",

      "title": "The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines is accompanied by a withdrawal syndrome which is typically characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, sweating, difficulty in concentration, dry wretching and nausea, some weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness and a host of perceptual changes. Instances are also reported within the high‐dosage category of more serious developments such as seizures and psychotic reactions. Withdrawal from normal dosage benzodiazepine treatment can result in a number of symptomatic patterns. The most common is a short‐lived “rebound” anxiety and insomnia, coming on within 1‐4 days of discontinuation, depending on the half‐life of the particular drug. The second pattern is the full‐blown withdrawal syndrome, usually lasting 10–14 days; finally, a third pattern may represent the return of anxiety symptoms which then persist until some form of treatment is instituted. Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines can occur following prolonged treatment with therapeutic doses, but it is not clear what proportion of patients are likely to experience a withdrawal syndrome. It is also unknown to what extent the risk of physiological dependence is dependent upon a minimum duration of exposure or dosage of these drugs. Withdrawal phenomena appear to be more severe following withdrawal from high doses or short‐acting benzodiazepines. Dependence on alcohol or other sedatives may increase the risk of benzodiazepine dependence, but it has proved difficult to demonstrate unequivocally differences in the relative abuse potential of individual benzodiazepines.",

There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

En su fisiopatologia estan implicados diferentes mecanismos tales como: la alteracion del ritmo circadiano, la sensibilidad retiniana a la luz, el metabolismo anormal de la melatonina y la disminucion de la secrecion de neurotransmisores, sobre todo de la serotonina. El tratamiento se basa en la fototerapia o farmacoterapia, optando por uno u otro segun las caracteristicas clinicas del paciente. El objetivo de este articulo, es hacer una revision clinica sobre dicho trastorno para su mejor reconocimiento y manejo.",

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking. The findings suggest that early-onset depression is associated with a greater degree of comorbidity and may represent a more serious form of the disorder.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

An increasing numbers of new psychoactive substances (NPS) are available on the market as previous substances disappear, generating a constant flow of drugs and constant variations in psychopharmacological properties. This dynamic comes with important difficulties in identifying the substances and their psychopharmacological mechanisms and in the substance-specific treatment. The International Classification of Diseases, the 11th revision (ICD-11), reclassifies the substances and pathologies to enable a better management of the disorders. Psychiatry occupies an important role in the management of substance use disorders along with several medical specialties, psychology, psychotherapy and other fields. The pharmacological treatment of these disorders can be applied in acute states such as acute intoxication and overdose, withdrawal states, substance-induced psychosis, delirium and also in the long-term management of withdrawal. Severe cases of agitation and aggressiveness were observed in patients using especially NPS and not rarely with legal implications. One particular situation that began to emerge on a worldwide scale is the multiple-drug use where the psychoactive substances can create unpredictable and life-threatening situations. In these cases, the treatment implies advanced knowledge of pharmacology and the long-term management has poor outcomes.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms causing great personal distress and impairing social and occupational function. The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

Dissociative drugs include ketamine, phencyclidine (PCP), and nitrous oxide. The term empathogens covers MDMA and similar drugs. The prevalence and mode of use of these drugs are described together with their pharmacological effects. Clinical syndromes include acute intoxication and chronic use, flashbacks (characteristic of psychedelic use in particular), psychosis, acute anxiety state, and acute and chronic brain syndromes. The principles of diagnosis and management are then outlined. Dependence is uncommon with hallucinogens, although with regular consumption of microdoses of LSD, it is increasingly recognized. It is well recognized for ketamine and derivatives.",

      "abstract": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, robbery) has caused some alarm in the general public. Drugs involved can be pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam), hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem), sedatives (neuroleptics, some antihistamines), or anesthetics (GHB, ketamine); drugs of abuse such as cannabis, ecstasy, or LSD; or, more often, ethanol. Mistreatment of older people, whether it is abuse or neglect, can be classified as physical, psychologic, or financial/material. Several types of mistreatment may occur simultaneously. Very few data are available in the international literature. It seems that mental abuse and neglect are more frequent, but physical abuse such as beating, pushing, kicking, and possibly sexual abuse have also been reported. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), can possess amnesic properties, and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood, or even urine, can be inadequate. This is the reason why some laboratories have developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations in which, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biologic specimens. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses, but as a complement. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry technologies appear to be required for analyses in drug-facilitated cases. The experience of the authors is presented in cases involving the elderly and chemical poisoning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The various forms of behavior that constitute the label “challenging behavior” are not diagnostic categories, although they are sometimes treated as such particularly by the medical profession when using psychotropics. These behaviors are usually elicited by residents when they are distressed, confused, disinhibited, misinterpreting situations, deluded, or hallucinating. The behaviors are often transient, but need to be dealt with when they place the resident or others at risk of physical, emotional, or psychological harm. Often the causes are multifactorial, although some can be directly linked to physical problems (delirium, infection, and pain). Owing to the complex nature of many of these behaviors, a comprehensive assessment of the potential causes should be undertaken. This should be done prior to the administration of medication. Once the causes have been identified, individualized approaches aimed at reducing the relevant distress (e.g. improved communication, use of aromatherapy, music, etc.) or confusion (use of memory aids, signage, environmental changes) have been shown to be helpful. However, such strategies need to take account of the needs of the individual with dementia, the staff, and the resources within the care setting. The present case illustrates an approach used by a clinical team that fulfills the above requirements, and the processes by which successful outcomes can be achieved have been illustrated.",

      "title": "Causal Thinking for Objective Psychiatric Diagnostic Criteria: A Programmatic Approach in Therapeutic Context",
      "abstract": "Terms such as disorder, illness, disease, dysfunction, and deviance embody the preconceptions of historical development (Klein, 1999). That individuals become ill for no apparent reason, suffering from pain, dizziness, malaise, rash, wasting, etc., has been known since prehistoric days. The recognition of illness led to the social definition of the patient and the development of various treatment institutions (e.g., nursing, medicine, surgery, quacks, and faith healers). Illness is an involuntary affliction that justifies the sick, dependent role (Parsons, 1951). That is, because the sick have involuntarily impaired functioning, it is a reasonable social investment to exempt them (at least temporarily) from normal responsibilities. Illness implies that something has gone wrong. However, gaining exemption from civil or criminal responsibilities is often desired. Therefore, if no objective criteria are available, an illness claim can be viewed skeptically. By affirming involuntary affliction, diagnosis immunizes the patient against charges of exploitative parasitism. Therefore, illness may be considered a hybrid concept, with two components: (1) the necessary inference that something has actually, involuntarily, gone wrong (disease) and (2) the qualification that the result (illness) must be sufficiently major, according to current social values, to ratify the sickness exemption role. The latter component is related to the particular historical stage, cultural traditions, and values. This concept has been exemplified by the phrase ‘‘harmful dysfunction’’ (Wakefield, 1992). However, this does not mean that the illness concept is arbitrary since the inference that something has gone wrong is necessary. Beliefs as to just what has gone wrong (e.g., demon possession, bad air, bacterial infection) as well as the degree of manifested dysfunction that warrants the sick role reflect the somewhat independent levels of scientific and social development (for further reference, see Lewis, 1967). How can we affirm that something has gone wrong if there is no objective evidence? The common statistical definition of abnormality simply is ‘‘unusual.’’ Something is abnormal if it is rare. Although biological variability ensures that someone is at an extreme, there is a strong presumption that something has gone wrong if sufficiently extreme.",

      "title": "Anxiety and Psychosomatic Illness",
      "abstract": "Since the DSMIII no longer classifies illness as psychosomatic, we must immediately redress the title of this paper (1). Rather than using the term psychosomatic illness, the new classification would list the specific psychiatric disorder as the primary diagnosis (Axis I) and the co-existing pathophysiologic disorder under Axis III. As an example, in a patient with mitral valve prolapse accompanied by panic, the Axis I would be anxiety disorder (panic disorder) and the Axis III would be Psychological Factors affecting Physical Condition. Such classifications tend to eschew a specific or directional relationship between the two. The wisdom of this causal-directional separation is questionable. To a large extent, it tends to disestablish the specificity theories that dominated earlier concepts regarding the psychogenicity of specific diseases such as Alexander's holy seven: ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, peptic ulcer, bronchial asthma, neuro-dermatitis (2). In so doing, it may once and for all abolish the idea that some diseases are more psychosomatic than others. Rather, the new classification would allow the idea that any illness, mental or somatic, may be accompanied by symptoms relative to one or the other. Thus, the patient with a parimary affective disorder with vegetative symptoms and signs is as likely to be viewed as somatic as well as mental in his assessment, diagnosis and treatment. On the other hand, a patient with symptoms and signs of ulcerative colitis might have manifestations of anxiety which would be identified respectively in Axes III and I. The relationship of anxiety to ulcerative colitis might be generative, derivative, or independent of the latter. Each, however, is treatable in its own right, a practice that has preceded the above formulation.",

      "abstract": "Depression affects millions of people worldwide, with no regard to socioeconomic status or ethnic background. Treatment resistance, defined as the lack of response to first-line, widely prescribed pharmacologic antidepressant treatments, affects up to 20% of patients with depression. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is associated with developing symptom chronicity and subsequent poor social and functional adjustment. TRD is a clinically heterogeneous entity, with significant comorbidities from personality traits or disorders, substance use disorders, chronic medical/physical issues, misdiagnosed bipolar illness, and anxiety or psychosis issues. For optimal treatment planning and to maximize response and symptom resolution, treatment resistance needs to be differentiated from the above-mentioned comorbidities. Strategies for pharmacologic treatment when a first-line antidepressant regimen fails include switching to another antidepressant (inter- or intraclass switching), augmentation with a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic, or use of thyroid hormone. Drugs with glutamatergic actions, such a ketamine, have proven very promising in addressing TRD symptoms and will likely see widespread use in the next few years.

Clinically, he reported seeing vivid, saturated colors and caricature-like objects. The patient described perceiving objects or people in motion as moving faster than normal. He reported living in a dream-like state and feeling numb and detached from other people and his surroundings. Upon pharmacotherapy initiation, facility transfer, and subsequent discharge from an acute psychiatry unit, he ultimately committed suicide. Although hallucinogen abuse is common in the United States, this case suggests that HPPD maybe significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated.

There is emerging evidence for efficacy of psychological treatments during, following and even prior to the first episode.

      "abstract": "When terminal sedation is made the object of bioethical discussion, it is mostly in a way that a literary critic might call synecdochal: A part is taken for the whole. What is made the object of discussion is a whole of which terminal sedation is only a part. Not unlike discussions of prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation diagnosis, it is only the combination with other medical behaviors that creates ethical problems. In the case of terminal sedation, it is the combination with the termination of some nonpalliative medical treatment. Only in this combination does terminal sedation become a form of euthanasia.\r\n\r\nIf one takes for granted the standard definition of terminal sedation, this medical procedure cannot by itself be considered to constitute an act of euthanasia. By this definition, terminal sedation is a treatment administered when other palliative treatments are not sufficiently effective, and which aims at keeping a severely suffering patient unconscious in the proximity of death. Relevant indications are agitation, fear of suffocating, vomiting, sleeplessness, and states of severe pain. According to this definition, the adjective “terminal” refers to nothing but the temporal incidence of sedation and leaves open the causal relation between sedation and subsequent death. It does not prejudge the issue of whether sedation stands in any causal relation to the patient's death. As a rule, it is assumed to have no causal role in this death; it makes it easier for the patient to live his last period of life, but does not causally contribute to death. It constitutes help in dying and not help to die.\r\n\r\nWhat is more controversial is the classification and evaluation of combinations of terminal sedation with the termination of other medical treatments, either preceding or following sedation.[1] This combination has been increasingly applied in medical practice, especially in The Netherlands, the country about whose practice we are best informed. In The Netherlands, terminal sedation has been increasingly used as an alternative to active euthanasia. The most recent Dutch survey, which for the first time includes information about terminal sedation, shows that in 2001 terminal sedation was given in 5.6% of all deaths. It also shows that in almost two thirds of these cases artificial nutrition and hydration were simultaneously withdrawn.[2] This combination of terminal sedation and termination of treatment, understood as the termination of some or all life-sustaining nonpalliative measures, will be the focus of discussion.",

      "title": "Isn’t it Time to Use Opioid Drugs in Emergency Medical Services?",
      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant feeling and experience that is caused by a potential or practical injury and its control is so important that the American Pain Society has introduced pain as the 5 th vital sign for emphasizing the importance of pain and controlling it. Almost all humans have experienced moderate to severe pain and most of the time the experience has happened following surgical procedures, medical conditions or trauma. When pain manifests in a clinical condition, health care staff are responsible for following it and relieving it as a goal and responsibility. Pain affects all individuals regardless of age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status and untreated pain can negatively affect various systems of the body and lead to many consequences. Increase in serum level of cortisol, nor epinephrine, and renin angiotension, hyperglycemia, decrease in insulin, manifestation of anxiety, cardiac effects such as ischemia, dysrhythmia, increase in pulse, increase in cardiac load, increased oxygen uptake, increased blood coagulation potential, hypertension especially in patients with head injuries, decreased blood oxygen level, increased body fluid volume, drop in blood potassium, fatigue, muscle cramps, decreased immune system function, decreased ability for wound healing and etc. are among the undesirable side effects of pain. In addition, not treating acute pains also leads to bearing unnecessary pain, elongated duration of hospitalization, increased medical costs and probability of acute pain progressing and developing into chronic pain. The financial burden of not treating pain in America has been estimated to be about 100 billion dollars per year. Pain is a common complaint and makes up a considerable portion of reasons that patients call pre-hospital emergency services and is usually present in the injured and trauma patients. Study results showed that 20% to 31% of the patients presenting via ambulances had moderate and severe pain. Additionally, with 52% to 86% prevalence in emergencies, pain is a key topic in health care of various countries. Pre-hospital emergency staff members are the first in line among health care staff that face patients at times of disaster and accident and are more exposed to the patients’ pain. Despite the quantitative growth of pre-hospital emergency bases to 1900 bases throughout Iran, observations of researchers and evidence and instructions of emergency medical services (EMS) of Iran are indicative of not using enough analgesic drugs, especially opioid analgesic drugs, as a means to relieve patients’ pain in EMS ambulances. Some studies have mentioned that about one third of the pre-hospital patients and more than 80% of patients with bone fractures report moderate to severe pain and on the other hand the positive effect of using pain killers in the regions that used them have been shown to be obvious in most patients. It seems that using analgesics in EMS is a very important topic and researchers express that proper pain management is an important principle in pre-hospital care and opioid analgesics such as morphine and fentanyl have a special place in the instructions of EMS as treatments for acute trauma and non-trauma pains, especially cardiac chest pains, in some advanced countries regarding emergency care. Considering the afore-mentioned points concerning the importance of pain and its treatment, especially the importance of treating pain in traumatic and ischemic cardiac diseases, high prevalence of pain in pre-hospital missions, severity and type of pre-hospital missions, which are mostly associated with pain, high costs of not treating pain and the obvious need for using pain killers in trauma and ischemic cardiac diseases, isn’t it time to introduce a more effective and scientific approach in EMS? Isn’t it better to add a few types of analgesics and opioid drugs to the equipment provided at patients’ bedside, at least for ischemic cardiac diseases and severe trauma? Although the result of a study carried out in Khuzestan province showed that EMS staff members were weak regarding drug information and calculations and other studies have also expressed that drug dosage and use of opioid drugs might not be done correctly or opioid drugs might be abused in some cases, none are convincing reasons for not using these drugs. These problems could be solved by more and better training for EMS staff, creating offline and online protocols and useful programs for preventing abuse of analgesic drugs and these drugs could be effectively used in EMS. Therefore, we again note that this treatment priority should not be overlooked for any reason.",

      "abstract": "The term \"sickness presence\" is used to describe situations where the ability to work is impaired due to disease, but yet the person goes to work. A problem is that the term \"sickness presence\" implies that being present at work is something exceptional if a person is sick. Most people diagnosed with a disease or disorder do, however, go to work and are not sick listed. Furthermore, the term \"sickness presence\" is rather diffuse, and it would be beneficial if one or several more specific terms could be used. The current body of scientific literature does not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the consequences of sickness presence.",

      "abstract": "Episode depresif merupakan diagnosis kejiwaan yang termasuk dalam kelompok diagnosis gangguan mood afektif. Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

      "abstract": "Catatonia-like presentations can be precipitated by multiple organic and medication-related causes. Psychiatric causes of catatonia are typically associated with underlying psychotic or mood disorders. Recurrent catatonia without other precipitating psychiatric diagnosis is rarely described. We present the case of a man in his early 30′s with idiopathic recurrent catatonia, presented with patient consent. Our case presented in a catatonic state, having recently stopped using cannabis. No organic cause for his presentation was identified following extensive investigation and he was admitted for psychiatric assessment. During admission he slowly improved with benzodiazepine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment, alongside psychological support. Despite near complete recovery, he significantly relapsed on 2 occasions requiring psychiatric re-admission over the subsequent 6 months. Thereafter, he had multiple relapsing episodes with decreasing severity during rehabilitative care. During admission we explored extensive differentials including mood disorders, schizophrenia or psychosis, drug abuse or poisoning, as underlying triggers for his catatonia. He had a finding of FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) on his second electroencephalogram (EEG), with no clinical correlate of seizure or structural abnormality. We found no evidence of any underlying psychiatric or organic cause for his presentation. In contrast to classical descriptions of catatonia or recurrent catatonia, our case highlights the need for greater recognition of isolated idiopathic catatonia, as a diagnosis independent of mood disorder or schizophrenia. Furthermore, we evidence effective recovery with psychological support, benzodiazepines and ECT.",

      "title": "Has the Drug of Choice for Treating Critical Illness Delirium Been Established?",
      "abstract": "Critical illness delirium (hereafter simplified to \"delirium\") is an acute confusional state seen in up to 80% of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 1 It is characterized by an altered level of consciousness, changes in cognition, perceptual disturbances, a fluctuating course, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, disorientation, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and hallucinations or delusions. 1As a constellation of symptoms and signs that commonly occur together, delirium should not be considered in and of itself a disease, but rather should be thought of as a syndrome, 2 specifically one of acute brain dysfunction that can typically be traced back to one or more inciting causes.The mainstay of therapy, therefore, must aim to address the underlying causes of the syndrome and not simply treat the symptoms.Just as for a patient presenting with new-onset congestive heart failure it would be inappropriate to treat the symptoms by administering furosemide and oxygen without looking for and treating the underlying cause (e.g., an acute coronary syndrome), the drug of choice for delirium cannot simply be the one that best treats the symptoms; rather, it must address the underlying cause.Therefore, the drug of choice to treat any given case of delirium will be patient-and cause-specific.It could be the antibiotic that targets the patient's infection, the free water that addresses the patient's hypernatremia, the laxatives that resolve the patient's constipation, the benzodiazepine that counters the patient's alcohol withdrawal, or the correct treatment that addresses any of the myriad other causes of delirium.The number of potential drivers of delirium is immense, and the reader is encouraged to consult other sources for further information on their assessment and treatment. 1,3,4 Of course, although it is essential to address the underlying etiology of delirium, its symptoms cannot be ignored, as they have the potential to cause significant harm to both the patient and the patient's care team.Anyone who has worked in an ICU for any period of time will have seen a patient with delirium self-extubate or pull out a Foley catheter with the balloon up!Such adverse events can result in significant morbidity and potentially even death. 5 Additionally, patients experiencing delirium can pose a danger to the care team if they become aggressive to the point of striking and injuring care providers.What may be less obvious is that these agitated patients are also at increased risk of morbidity",

      "title": "Reconsidering the term ‘disinhibition’ in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors‐induced apathy syndrome",
      "abstract": "Apathy occurs in individuals treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).1, 2 This adverse effect of SSRI was first reported as ‘frontal lobe syndrome’ or simply ‘apathy’ by Hoehn-Saric et al. in 1990.3, 4 Barnhart et al.5 later described this phenomenon as ‘SSRI-induced apathy syndrome.’ Most of the subsequent studies on emotional or motivational problems induced by SSRI have investigated only apathy as a symptom, but Hoehn-Saric et al. described disinhibition in addition to apathy in their first case reports.3 Others have also reported the same phenomenon.6, 7 We report the case of a patient who walked around in a garden in the snow against her better judgment after her panic disorder was improved by an SSRI2 Our patient did not show symptoms sufficient for the diagnosis of hyperthymia or dissociative disorder. ‘Disinhibition’ is usually understood as ‘doing what is against one's sense of ethics,’ whereas disinhibition induced by SSRI is rather closer to ‘doing what one is unwilling to do or what one knows is unnecessary.’ Clinicians should be aware of disinhibition induced by SSRI, because disinhibition and/or apathy could be misdiagnosed as treatment-resistant depression,2 mixed status, or conversion to a manic phase. These phenomena can be distinguished from mixed or manic states based on the presence of agitation8 or a total mood change, or on sleep and daily activities. Reduced activation was reported after the administration of SSRI in both the ventral striatum and medial/orbitofrontal cortex related to the reward system and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex associated with aversive stimuli.1 Odd disinhibition behavior induced by SSRI may be explained by these mechanisms. We recommend that the term ‘disinhibition’ should be replaced with another term to precisely describe SSRI-induced adverse behavior. Such a term (e.g., ‘involuntary unwilling behavior induced by an SSRI’) that excludes behaviors that are in violation of one's sense of ethics would be more appropriate.

      "title": "Epileptic seizures and headache/migraine: A review of types of association and terminology",
      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Many studies of social anxiety disorder (SAD) have been conducted because diagnostic criteria are defined as social phobia in DSM-III in the West. In Japan, several studies have examined pathological conditions similar to SAD, known as taijin-kyofu (TK). This highly remarkable disorder involves a convincing fear of giving another person discomfort from one's physical faults (e.g. feeling that neighboring people detect an unpleasant smell from one's body, \"jikoshu-kyofu\", or feeling that neighboring people feel unpleasant because of one's appearance,\"shukei-kyofu\") termed \"convinced subtype of TK\" (c-TK; also known as offensive subtype of TK). In DSM-5, the definitions of feeling rejection and offense of others are added to a fear of humiliating or embarrassing oneself. Moreover, TK is a sufficient criterion for SAD. However, it is confusing that body dysmorphic disorder is not in category of somatoform disorders but in that of obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders and that the Japanese terms of \"jikoshu-kyofu\" and \"shubo-kyofu\" are categorized as other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders. The efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of SAD has been reported in many controlled studies. Recently, SSRIs are regarded as first line pharmacotherapy for SAD. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also effective for SAD treatment. High rates of co-occurring SAD and other psychiatric disorders can be found in clinical samples and in the general population. Additional research must be conducted for these patients and for the management of treatment-refractory SAD patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two principal ingredients of natural cannabis with counteracting functions. Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are much more potent than natural cannabis, since they act as a more potent full agonist at the cannabinoid subtype 1 receptor than THC, and they also lack cannabinoids such as CBD that may otherwise counteract psychoactive properties of THC. Therefore, SCs may induce a more severe clinical presentation than natural cannabis does: the use of SCs may be associated with agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, hallucinations, irritability, memory and cognitive impairment, violent behavior, unresponsiveness, and psychosis. Clinical characteristics, specificity of the disease course and patient profile of the SC-induced psychoses are still poorly characterized in the scientific literature. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the psychotic disorders in patients with synthetic cannabinoid use disorder in terms of patient profile and clinical characteristics with reference to their follow-up. Methods A total of 60 male patients (n=60; mean (standard deviation [SD]) age: 23.6 (3.5) years) diagnosed with psychotic disorder induced by the SC use who were hospitalized at the intensive care unit or emergency department of the Moscow Research and Practical Centre on Addictions of the Moscow Department of Healthcare were included in this single-centre, longitudinal, observational cohort study. The catamnestic follow-up period was up to 2 years. Results We evaluated different clinical cases of SC-induced psychoses and identified four clinical types of them on the ground of leading psychopathological syndrome during the patient’s entire length of hospitalization: Then we performed a catamnestic follow-up of patients to reveal the possible schizophrenic process manifestation in patients who use SC. Catamnestic follow-up revealed that manifestation of the schizophrenic process was present in 8 patients (13% of cases). Discussion Our results revealed that SC-induced psychoses affect young adults primarily. Consistent with the statement that the majority of first-time SC users are experienced marijuana smokers, SC was used following other transitional substances rather than as the first substance in the majority of our patients, with cannabis being the most popular antecedent substance. SC was not the first substance used in the majority of our patients, and it had been preceded by use of other transitional substances, such as cannabis in most cases. Despite the exogenous nature, structurally such psychoses are often endoformic. For instance, even the delirium is atypical and includes the elements of Kandinsky-Clerambault’s syndrome. Psychopathologically hallucinations and delusions dominate in the clinical presentation of the psychoses (with predominant hallucinatory symptoms or affective paranoid symptoms). Development of substance-induced psychoses is often associated with the manifestation of the schizophrenic process (in our study it was revealed in 13% of cases). It is extremely difficult to create a differential diagnosis between such psychotic disorders and a primary endogenous psychotic episode. In such cases the appearance of deficit symptoms specific for schizophrenia becomes crucial.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) is a cluster of physiological, behavioural and cognitive phenomena wherein alcohol use takes on a much higher priority for a given individual than other behaviours that once had great value. A definite diagnosis of ADS should be made with the diagnostic guidelines of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 classification of mental diseases. The harm caused by ADS constitutes a major public health problem, as it causes numerous mental and physical disorders and imposes a massive economic burden. Excessive spending on alcohol leads to debts and heavy treatment expenses, amongst other financial consequences. The conventional treatment utilises several medications for detoxification, craving reduction and withdrawal management. However, homoeopathy can provide a valid and effective treatment to help patients to break the cycle of alcohol dependence, reduce the craving and relieve the withdrawal symptoms without adverse effects. A 35-year-old male patient presented with an irresistible desire to take alcohol and withdrawal symptoms of tremors in abstinence at the outpatient department (OPD) of National Homoeopathy Research Institute in Mental Health, Kottayam. The condition was diagnosed as ADS as it fulfilled the diagnosis guidelines provided in the ICD-10. Initially, the patient was treated in the OPD without significant improvement. Later, the patient was admitted into the inpatient department, and after careful case-taking, the homoeopathic medicine Bufo Rana 200 was prescribed. After the remedy was administered, the alcohol craving and dependence were markedly reduced, and the symptoms of withdrawal were relieved. The alcohol dependence was assessed using the severity of the alcohol dependence questionnaire, and the score changed from 46 to 2. The causal attribution for the outcome changes was assessed using the Modified Naranjo Criteria for Homeopathy-Causal Attribution Inventory. The score was +9, close to the maximum (13), showing the positive relationship between the intervention and the outcome. Therefore, this case report strongly suggests that the homoeopathic medicine Bufo Rana has a positive role in treating ADS.",

Converging evidence from multiple countries exists across epidemiological, longitudinal, experimental, and meta‐analytic studies. Addiction is associated with numerous forms and severities of violence. Alcohol has the strongest and largest body of evidence as a (potentially causal) risk factor for violence. Stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamines are also consistently found to be related to violence. Most major violence risk assessment instruments incorporate some index of addiction or other substance‐related problem as a risk factor. Four main explanatory models—psychopharmacological, systemic, economic compulsion, interactional—for the link between addiction and other substance‐related problems are reviewed.",

Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer. This is one of the possible explanations of disappearing of manic or hypomanic symptoms at a higher dose.",

      "abstract": "One of frequent presentations of multiple sclerosis (MS) is chronic fatigue that may be determined as a subjective decrease of the physic and/or psychic energy level. Fatigue can be divided into asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (exhaustion during physical loading) and fatigue concomitant with other symptoms (MS exacerbation). There are central as well as peripheral mechanisms of fatigue formation. Frequent is a combination of fatigue and affective disorders in MS, in particular depression, as well as sleep disturbances (insomnia, restless legs syndrome) that may indicate the common origin of their mechanisms, i.e. reduction of serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems activity. Endocrinal and autoimmune components are considered as important in fatigue syndrome formation, the latter exerting more influence on asthenia than on pathological fatigability. Further investigation into pathogenetic mechanisms of asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (fatigue in active state) and specification of their differential diagnostic features allow not only to understand the essence of this syndrome but to choose an adequate individualized therapy.",

No obstante, los cuestionarios, escalas, etc. son herramientas de gran ayuda en la detección de consumo de riesgo, consumo perjudicial o alcoholismo. Por su validez, brevedad y sencillez el CAGE, CBA y AUDIT podrían considerarse como los cuestionarios de detección más útiles en Atención Primaria. Existen, de igual modo, una serie de cuestionarios que abordan otros aspectos relevantes de esta patología, tales como gravedad de la dependencia, valoración del síndrome de abstinencia o valoración del deseo por la bebida y pérdida de control que pueden resultar de gran ayuda, al clínico, a la hora de establecer estrategias terapéuticas. La elevada prevalencia de comorbilidad psiquiátrica (sobre todo trastornos afectivos y de la personalidad) detectada en estos pacientes hace necesario un abordaje integral de los mismos, siendo recomendable una evaluación detallada para descartar éstas u otras patologías psiquiátricas. Recordar, por último, que el consumo excesivo de alcohol se acompaña de gran discapacidad, siendo conveniente la valoración de su impacto. En líneas generales, se recomienda la utilización de instrumentos que cuenten con propiedades psicométricas reconocidas y que hayan sido adaptados y validados en castellano.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

      "abstract": "Abstract A seizure (also called attack, crisis, turn, fit, breakout, trembling, convulsion, and insult) is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behavior due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain, in particular the outer layer of the brain called the cortex. Epilepsy means recurrent seizures. Seizures can take many different forms, as the descriptions in this book indicate. However, any given person usually has a limited number of different types of seizures that they experience, and readers should understand that seizures affect different people in different ways. The material in this book points out these differences, but should not be taken to imply that every person with seizures will experience everything described in this book at some time. Sometimes, seizures can be triggered by alcohol, strong emotions, intense exercise, flashing lights or loud music, illness and fever, the menstrual period, lack of sleep, and stress. Often an individual learns to recognize what they may be susceptible to. Sometimes there is no identifiable or consistent trigger. Seizures have a beginning, a middle, and an end. When an individual is aware of the beginning, it may be thought of as a warning. Another word used for the warning is the aura. Auras are actually seizures that affect only a very small part of the brain; enough to cause symptoms, but not enough to disrupt consciousness. Doctors may refer to auras as “simple partial seizures”—“simple” means that consciousness is not impaired, and “partial” means that only part of the brain is involved with the seizure.",

The criterion is that the individual has a maladaptive reaction to a somatic symptom. In DSM-5 the terms somatisation disorder, pain disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder have been discarded, whereas factitious disorder as well as psychological factors affecting other medical conditions have been added to somatic symptom disorder and other disorders. Conversion disorder remains as it was in DSM-IV. Hypochondriasis has been renamed 'illness anxiety disorder'.The new description of somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5 represents a big step forwards, because the decision has been made to use, for classification, a positive criterion, namely maladaptive reaction to a somatic symptom, instead of the earlier negative criterion, namely that the symptoms should be medically unexplained. Before attaching the ssd label to an illness, the clinician will have to weigh up the clinical consequences of this psychiatric diagnosis.",

While it can indeed be a symptom accompanying other mental illnesses, it is also a full-blown disorder unto itself, recognized by every major diagnostic manual. Chapter 1 discusses the symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder through historical documentation and personal stories. The core symptoms, as outlined in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, include detachment from one’s whole self or from aspects of the self (such as feelings, thoughts, the body, and agency), as well as detachment from the outside world. Origins of the term “depersonalization” are discussed, and historical as well as current descriptions of symptoms are brought to life through personal quotes and stories. These substantiate depersonalization/derealization as an independent syndrome rather than simply a symptom of other disorders. This chapter sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of this fascinating, multifaceted, and under-researched condition.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

Even though it has not been included in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition , “behavioral addictions” section, CBD is a hot topic in current clinical psychiatry, because of its relevant prevalence (at least 5% in adult populations) and severe effect on quality of life. The CBD shares some clinical features with substance-related and behavioral addictions, impulse control disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder, and it is often comorbid with other psychiatric illnesses (especially depressive and anxiety disorders). The treatment of CBD is therefore difficult, and clear therapeutic guidelines are not yet available. Treating the comorbid disorders as the first-line approach, or combining drugs with different pharmacodynamic profiles, has been suggested to address this challenging condition. Case A 60-year-old woman affected by a severe form of CBD with comorbid major depressive disorder, resistant/intolerant to previous selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatments and only partially responder to mirtazapine, achieved a good clinical improvement adding bupropion. Conclusions Combining 2 agents with different pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of action, such as bupropion and mirtazapine, could be a useful strategy in the management of complex CBD cases.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

Cognitive impairment, (muscle) weakness, circulatory disturbances, marked variability of symptoms, and, above all, post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after minor exertion, are distinctive symptoms of ME.Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was introduced in 1988 and was redefined into clinically evaluated, unexplained (persistent or relapsing) chronic fatigue, accompanied by at least four out of a list of eight symptoms, e.g. headaches and unrefreshing sleep, in 1994.Although the labels are used interchangeably, ME and CFS define distinct diagnostic entities. Post-exertional malaise and cognitive deficits e.g. are not mandatory for the diagnosis CFS, while obligatory for the diagnosis ME. \"Fatigue\" is not obligatory for the diagnosis ME.Since fatigue and other symptoms are subjective and ambiguous, research has been hampered.

Terjadi peningkatan penyalahgunaan Narkotika, Psikotropika dan Zat Adiktif lainnya (NAPZA) di Indonesia dari tahun ke tahun, terutama penggunaan ganja karena mudah didapat. Di Indonesia terdapat antara 2-3juta orang yang pernah menghisap ganja. Penggunaan ganja dapat menyebabkan penyakit fisik (gangguan pernafasan dan kardiovaskuler) maupun mental (gangguan psikotik). Penggunaan ganja secara teratur terkait dengan munculnya gejala psikotik seperti pemikiran tidak teratur (disorganized), halusinasi, dan delusi. Umumnya para pengguna menggunakan beberapa zat, tetapi pada kasus ini hanya menggunakan satu zat saja yaitu ganja. Pada laporan ini, kami menyampaikan kasus lelaki umur 30 tahun yang mengonsumsi ganja sejak usia 17 tahun didiagnosis dengan gangguan mental dan perilaku akibat penggunaan zat multipel dan penggunaan zat psikoaktif lainnya dengan sindrom ketergantungan (F19.2) dan episode depresi sedang dengan gejala somatik (F32.11). Pasien mengalami halusinasi visual dan auditorik. Pasien mendapat terapi clozapine 25 miligram tiap 12 jam intraoral. Kasus diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan ganja secara kontinu memicu terjadinya psikotik.Dependence and substance abuse is not a new problem in Indonesia. There is an increase in the abuse of Narcotics, Psychotropic and other Addictive Substances (NAPZA) in Indonesia over the years, especially the use of cannabis because it is easy to obtain. Among 2-3 million people in Indonesia have smoked cannabis. The use of cannabis can cause physical illness (respiratory and cardiovascular disorders) as well as mental (psychotic disorders). Regular use of cannabis is associated with the emergence of psychotic symptoms such as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and delusions. Generally users use some substance, but in this case only use oneÂ substance that is marijuana. In this report we present the case of 30-year-old man who consumed marijuana since the age of 17 years was diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple substances use and other psychoactive substance use with addiction syndrome (F19.2) and episodes of severely depressed somatic symptoms (F32.11). The patient experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. Patients were given 25 milligrams of clozapine therapy every 12 hours intraoral. From this case can be concluded that the continuous use of cannabis trigger the occurrence of psychotic.",

Descriptions of the premorbid personalities of those who became psychotic resemble descriptions of LSD and marijuana users who experienced prolonged psychiatric difficulty. In addition, the psychosis produced can often be recognized as a \"hallucinogen\" psychosis. Certain features of the phencyclidine psychosis, namely the neurologic abnormalities, dose-related severity of symptoms, and regularity of the length of illness, are not noted with other psychedelic drugs, leading to the conclusion that PCP psychosis is a drug effect rather than a brief functional psychosis precipitated by the disintegrating PCP experience.

Although the term \"addictive\" has been used loosely with many behaviors, it may be an appropriate term to describe compulsive shopping. Increased accessibility, hyperstimulating marketing techniques, a loss of the protective delay between impulse and purchase, and overvaluing of the shopping process and objects purchased may all contribute to the potentially addictive nature of shopping.",

Las sustancias comúnmente implicadas, como la metanfetamina, el gamma hidroxibutirato (GHB)/gamma-butirolactona (GBL) y la mefedrona, son utilizadas para intensificar la experiencia sexual, desinhibir y prolongar la duración del acto. Este fenómeno ha ganado visibilidad en los últimos años debido a sus implicaciones para la salud pública, que van desde la transmisión de infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS) hasta trastornos psicológicos y dependencia a las drogas. El chemsex no solo tiene un impacto sobre la salud física, sino también sobre la salud mental al estar asociado a problemas como la ansiedad, la depresión y el aislamiento social. Las características particulares de esta práctica hacen que los profesionales de la salud, en especial en Atención Primaria (AP), enfrenten desafíos tanto en el diagnóstico como en el manejo adecuado de estas personas. Es crucial que el personal médico de AP se prepare para reconocer este fenómeno y proporcionar una atención no estigmatizante, dada la posible reticencia de los pacientes a exponer sus comportamientos sexuales y el uso de sustancias. En este artículo de revisión, se explorarán aspectos clave del chemsex, incluyendo su contexto sociocultural, la epidemiología en España, las principales sustancias utilizadas y las pautas de diagnóstico y manejo en AP. Además, se abordará la necesidad de una estrecha coordinación entre distintos niveles asistenciales para proporcionar una atención integral y eficaz a este tipo de pacientes. La creciente prevalencia del chemsex subraya la urgencia de mejorar la formación médica y las estrategias de salud pública que aborden tanto los riesgos asociados como la prevención.

      "abstract": "Résumé La découverte d'une chimiothérapie antidépressive a eu, sur le plan theorique, des conséquences qui n'étaient pas apparues avec celle des neuroleptiques et des tranquillisants. Le terme meme d'antidepresseur le souligne. Il s'agit en effet d'une classe de molécules qui agissent sur un ensemble de comportements définis et sur eux seuls. La question demeure ouverte de savoir comment les modifications neurophysiologiques obtenues par ces molecules agissent sur le comportement. Le fait que nous n'ayons pas une réponse précise à cette question explique sans doute la part importante de la resistance que Ton rencontre encore dans la prescription des antidepresseurs. On ne retrouve pas ce fait pour les neuroleptiques et les tranquillisants, bien que ces derniers présentent des effets secondaires plus nocifs (dyskinésie ou troubles mnésiques par exemple). Une première erreur consiste à confondre cause et mécanisme. Ce n'est pas parce que la chimiotherapie depressive agit sur la symptomatologie que le déficit qu'elle corrige est nécessairement, et encore moins uniquement, la cause de survenue de cet etat. En ce qui concerne les causes, nous devons conserver un point de vue pluraliste et uniciste à la fois en considerant qu'il s'agit d'une «maladie» pluri-factorielle. En termes de mécanisme, notre pensee doit demeurer resolument dualiste et reconnaftre un principe de parallélisme entre événements neurophysiologiques et événements comportementaux. La seconde erreur consiste à confondre liaison synaptique avec le concept classique de centre nerveux. Un exemple de cette confusion nous est peut-être donné par la recherche, jusqu'à présent stérile, de dépressions «noradrénergique» ou «sérotoninergique». Il est fort possible que les molécules dont nous disposons agissent sur des rélais dans un reseau de neurones qui sont impliqués dans les mécanismes comportementaux. La troisième erreur porte sur la manière dont nous traitons l'analyse comportementale de la dépression en se référant à une sémiologie qui a été construite à des fins tout-à-fait différentes (diagnostic d'une maladie et prévision de son évolution). Une analyse comportementale qui voudrait cerner de plus près l'action des molécules devrait renoncer à cette sémiologie et dégager des traits de comportement directement sensibles à l'action des medicaments. A la notion trop vague et trop globale de trouble de l'humeur, il serait sans doute utile de substituer celle de système ou plan d'action et de mecanisme d'interruption ou de ralentissement de l'exécution de ces plans.",

Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health-care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are well-recognized outcomes of delirium. Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

      "title": "Central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS) in anesthesia and intensive care.",
      "abstract": "Many of the drugs used in anesthesia and intensive care may cause blockade of the central cholinergic neurotransmission. Acetylcholine is of significance in modulation of the interaction among most other central transmitters. The clinical picture of the central cholinergic blockade, known as the central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS), is identical with the central symptoms of atropine intoxication. This behaviour consists of agitation including seizures, restlessness, hallucinations, disorientation or signs of depression such as stupor, coma and respiratory depression. Such disturbances may be induced by opiates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, ketamine, etomidate, propofol, nitrous oxide, and halogenated inhalation anesthetics as well as by H2-blocking agents such as cimetidine. There is an individual predisposition for CAS--but unpredictable from laboratory findings or other signs. Reports of postanesthetic occurrence of the CAS requiring treatment are not unanimous, varying between 1 and 40%. Differential diagnosis of the CAS includes disorders of glucose and electrolyte metabolism, severe hormonal imbalance, respiratory disorders (hypoxia, hypercarbia), hypothermia, hyperthermia and neuropsychiatric diseases (cerebral hypoxia, stroke, catatony, acute psychosis). The CAS may considerably impair the postanesthetic period especially when agitation is prevalent, which may endanger the patient or the surgical results. The diagnosis is confirmed ex iuvantibus by the sudden increase in the acetylcholine level in the brain. This is achieved with physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor able to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Its peripheral muscarinic effects are minimal. Postanesthetic CAS can be prevented by administration of physostigmine during the anesthesia procedure. During intensive care (IC), agitated forms of CAS may occur in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, particularly during prolonged high-dose sedation. Artificial ventilation of such patients becomes very difficult and muscle relaxation may be necessary. In these cases of IC-CAS, physostigmine is of value and has proven beneficial during weaning from mechanical ventilation. Dealing with the CAS for more than a decade has improved knowledge of the central cholinergic transmission. For example, it can be said that CAS occurs alongside general anesthesia, being no more than a frequent side-effect. Furthermore, acetylcholine is involved in nociception through the endorphinergic and the serotoninergic systems. There is a close relation between the central cholinergic transmission and actions of nitrous oxide. Moreover, cholinergic transmission is involved in withdrawal from (among others) alcohol, opiates, hallucinogens and nitrous oxide. In some intoxications with psychoactive agents, physostigmine is useful for reversal of the central nervous symptoms of the acute intoxication itself. In addition it can be used for prevention of some withdrawal states. In",

Such evidence is poor also because suicidal patients were systematically excluded from clinical trials, for ethical reasons. Several key ideas are important in the management of the suicidal person. First, the multidimensional assessment of suicidal risk defines the areas of interference with various axis I or axis II disorders, but also with the complex psychosocial environment of such patients. The therapeutic approach must be adapted by taking into account various factors (i.e. gender, age group, degree of social exclusion, etc.). Furthermore, case management must take into account the type of suicidal behavior (acute suicidal crisis or chronic suicidal state), this typology being dependent on the link with axis I disorders, more frequent in acute suicidal crisis, or with disorders belonging axis II, more common in chronic, repetitive suicidal behavior.",

In the absence of depressive symptoms, the psychological organization of pain can be understood as a substitution. Such a situation leads to a \"stabilization\" of the symptom and more prolonged chronicity than when depression presents at the same time, since in these patients, referral for psychotherapy is delayed.",

Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4).

      "abstract": "The acute use of alcohol and several other licit and illicit drugs can affect mental state and cognitive function. The chronic use of certain drugs may also increase the risk of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life. This paper focuses on the long-term cognitive consequences of using alcohol, benzodiazepines, tobacco and cannabis. Currently available evidence indicates that mild to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and may in fact have a protective effect against dementia, although heavy, long-term consumption is likely to have a negative impact on cognitive function. The degree that alcohol-related cognitive impairment must reach to be classified as dementia is currently obscure. Longer-term smoking is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and possibly dementia. The chronic use of benzodiazepines has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment but information relating to dementia remains inconclusive. The chronic use of cannabis may impair intellectual abilities but data on this topic remain sparse and difficult to interpret. In conclusion, there is evidence that some drugs contribute to the causal pathway that leads to the development of cognitive impairment but currently available data do not support the introduction of a separate diagnostic category of drug-induced dementia (such as alcohol-related dementia). Health promotion programs designed to decrease tobacco smoking and \"harmful\" alcohol use (and possibly other drug use) may decrease the burden of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life.",

      "abstract": "In Canada, about one in five adults older than 18 years of age live with chronic pain. Pain can be sub-defined by three main biological mechanisms: 1) Nociceptive pain (from damage to body tissue, as in injury, disease or inflammation); 2) Neuropathic pain (from direct damage of the nervous system); and 3) Nociplastic pain (from a change in sensory neurons function). Chronic pain is associated with significant emotional distress, like anxiety, anger, frustration and depression, and is recognized by the World Health Organization as a disease by itself listed in the International Classification of Disease version 11. Treatment and management of chronic pain are complex and difficult, involving multiple interventions, including pharmacological and psychological interventions. Pharmacological interventions considered for chronic pain include nonopioid analgesics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen), antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, other adjuvant medications (e.g., topical agents, cannabis and cannabinoids), opioid, and infusion therapies (e.g., ketamine, lidocaine).Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been approved and primarily used as an anesthetic induction agent in doses ranging between 1 and 4.5 mg/kg. As it also interacts with other receptors, ketamine has been explored for other indications such as depressive disorders, suicidal ideation, substance-use disorders, anxiety disorders, refractory status epilepticus, bronchial asthma exacerbations, and pain management. In hospital and emergency department, ketamine has been used for pain management of acute conditions such as burns, trauma, or post-operative pain. Recently, intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions has been increasingly used as a treatment option for acute pain as well as chronic non-cancer pain such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), neuropathic pain, and other refractory chronic pain conditions. Despite potential opportunities of ketamine for numerous indications, the use of ketamine is known to be associated with psychotomimetic effects such as euphoria, dysphoria, psychomotor retardation, hallucinations, vivid dreams, and nightmares, as common side effects. Given the availability of ketamine of different formulations and its potential opportunities in pain management, there is a need to determine its benefits and risks in the treatment of chronic pain.The aim of this report is to review the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ketamine for treating chronic non-cancer pain in adults. This report also aims to review the evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of ketamine for chronic non-cancer pain.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome is a common and important cause of long-standing sleep-onset insomnia, restless nighttime sleep, daytime fatigue, and, in some instances, great mental distress. The clinical symptoms of this disorder are distinctive and form the basis for making the diagnosis. The severity of restless legs syndrome varies considerably. Some individuals have severe symptoms that cause repeated and prolonged awakenings. Others are aware of only mild symptoms at bedtime that prolong falling asleep. Patients may complain of insomnia, especially difficulty with sleep onset and repeated nighttime awakenings. Most characteristic of restless legs syndrome are reports of sensations deep in the muscles. This disorder may begin at any age, including during childhood. Restless legs syndrome is strongly associated with iron deficiency. It is also associated with pregnancy (especially the last trimester), kidney failure, dialysis, anemia, cancer, and other medical conditions that cause peripheral nerve and muscle disorders.",

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy is evidenced as an altered mental state with various neurological symptoms, such as memory and cognitive problems. The type of a substance-evoked encephalopathy will depend on the drug, substance, or combination being abused. The categories into which we could place the various abused substances could be tentatively divided into stimulants, amphetamines, hallucinogens, narcotics, inhalants, anesthetics, anabolic steroids, and antipsychotics/antidepressants. Other factors that may underlie encephalopathy, such as infectious agents, environmental, and other factors have also to be taken into account. Drugs of abuse can be highly toxic to the CNS following acute, but more so in chronic exposure, and can produce significant damage to other organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The damage to these organs may be at least partially reversible when drug abuse is stopped but CNS damage from repeated or prolonged abuse is often irreversible. The major pathways for the organ and CNS toxicity could be related to ischemic events as well as increased cell damage due to metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in increased excitotoxicity, reduced energy production, and lowered antioxidant potential. These susceptibilities could be strengthened by the use of antioxidants to combat free radicals (e.g., vitamin E, lipoic acid); trying to improve energy generation by using mitochondriotropic/metabolic compounds (e.g., thiamine, coenzyme Q10, carnitine, riboflavin); by reducing excitotoxicity (e.g., glutamate antagonists) and other possible strategies, such as robust gene response, need to be investigated further. The drug-abuse-evoked encephalopathy still needs to be studied further to enable better preventative and protective strategies.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) that persists for 1 year or more following withdrawal of neuroleptics is usually said to be permanent. Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

A pertinent question herein is whether such substances might adversely affect testimonies of victims, eyewitnesses, or suspects by propelling the formation of false memory and increasing susceptibility to suggestion. In the current review, we amassed all available evidence on the effects of intoxication on false memory formation and suggestibility, including the substances alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, and antipsychotics. Our review indicated that alcohol and cannabis under certain conditions increased the susceptibility to false memories and/or suggestion with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. When intoxicated during an event, alcohol is most likely to increase this susceptibility at high intoxication levels or after a delay, whereas cannabis exerts detrimental effects during acute intoxication but not necessarily once sober. For other substances, ecologically valid research separating different memory phases is needed. Overall, differences between substances regarding false memory effects exist, suggesting that a nuanced approach is needed when dealing with intoxicated individuals in a legal context.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in knowledge about cannabinoid receptor function have renewed interest in the association between cannabis and psychosis. Converging lines of evidence suggest that cannabinoids can produce a full range of transient schizophrenia-like positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Cannabinoids also produce some psychophysiological deficits also known to be present in schizophrenia. Also clear is that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. Increasing evidence suggests that early and heavy cannabis exposure may increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. The relationship between cannabis exposure and schizophrenia fulfills some, but not all, of the usual criteria for causality. However, most people who use cannabis do not develop schizophrenia, and many people diagnosed with schizophrenia have never used cannabis. Therefore, it is likely that cannabis exposure is a “component cause” that interacts with other factors to “cause” schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to do so alone. In the absence of known causes of schizophrenia, however, and the implications for public health policy should such a link be established the role of component causes such as cannabinoid exposure should remain a focus of further study. Finally, further work is necessary to identify the factors that underlie individual vulnerability to cannabinoid-related psychosis and to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying this risk.",

      "title": "Is distress a symptom of mental disorders, a marker of impairment, both or neither?",
      "abstract": "In discussing the virtues of disentangling assessments of functional impairment from the diagnostic criteria for mental disorders, Ustun and Kennedy have not considered “distress” – a concept without any clear definitional boundaries that is, nevertheless, used widely in the DSM system and, to a lesser extent, in the ICD system. \r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, distress is matched with functional impairment: DSM-IV criteria for most depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, sleep disorders, somatoform disorders and some other disorders require the presence of either functional impairment or “clinically significant distress” (in some diagnoses labeled as “marked distress”), and ICD-10 criteria for several diagnoses (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), hypochondriasis, sleep disorders, personality disorders) also require either functional impairment or distress. Assuming it will be possible to convince clinicians and researchers to carve out functional impairment from diagnostic criteria – a process that will be more traumatic for some disorders than others – a subsequent problem will be to decide what to do with “distress” in the proposed integrated DSM-ICD diagnostic schemata. The options include jettisoning the concept entirely, making distress a required stand-alone symptom for these disorders, or integrating distress into the assessment of functional impairment.\r\n\r\nSome writers 1, 2 argue that distress is a transient phenomenon related to specific stressors that subsides when the stressor disappears or as the individual adapts to the stressor. However, if the experience of distress is far in excess of what is culturally appropriate or persists well after the termination of the primary (or secondary) stressor, then it is considered part of a pathological psychological process and should be seen as a marker of a mental disorder 1. These authors argue that failure to discriminate these two situations leads to medicalization of normal responses to stress 2, 3. However, reliably making this distinction between “normal” and maladaptive distress can often be quite difficult, because it requires detailed information about the stressors affecting the individual and about “appropriate” responses to such stressors for persons of the same age, gender and educational level in the individual’s socio-cultural environment. \r\n\r\nThe DSM-IV attempts to eschew social causation of symptoms (with a few notable exceptions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorder), so there are no criteria for determining when distress becomes “clinically significant”. In practice, this usually hinges on an assessment of the degree of impairment produced by the distress, not on the “inappropriateness” of the distress. Based on this conceptualization of distress, the danger of medicalization of normal responses, the difficulty of discriminating normal and maladaptive distress, and the probable substantial overlap between functional impairment and “clinically significant distress” as operationalized in the DSM, suggest that little would be lost if the term “distress” was completely removed from the diagnostic criteria.\r\n\r\nOther authors 4 argue that distress is an underlying component of anxiety and depression that is not transient and not normal, an interpretation that is more consonant with the usage of distress in the DSM and ICD systems. But there are substantial differences in the treatment of distress between the two diagnostic systems, and inconsistencies in the use of distress between different diagnoses within each system. In DSM-IV distress is an important indicator of the severity of depressive disorders (co-equal with functional impairment), but in ICD-10 distress is not considered in the diagnosis of depressive disorders (other than as one of the “non-diagnostic symptoms” for other depressive episodes). In the DSM-IV criteria for phobias and OCD, distress is both a marker of severity (co-equal with impairment) and given equal status with anxiety as a cardinal characteristic of the core symptoms (e.g., the recurrent thoughts of OCD must cause “marked anxiety or distress”); in ICD-10 “emotional distress” is a required, stand-alone symptom for phobias (not matched with impairment) and a marker of severity of OCD (co-equal with impairment), but is not mentioned as a characteristic of the core symptoms of either phobias or OCD. In the ICD-10 criteria for somatoform disorder, “persistent distress” leads to repeated care-seeking but this is not mentioned in the DSM-IV criteria. Separation anxiety disorder must include “recurrent excessive distress” (DSM-IV) or “excessive, recurrent distress” (ICD-10) about separation.\r\n\r\nThese examples show that both diagnostic systems use distress as a stand-alone symptom, as a qualifier of other symptoms and as a general measure of severity; but neither the DSM-IV nor the ICD-10 provides a definition of the term, so there can be a wide range of interpretations of the corresponding diagnostic criteria. The frequent use of various qualifiers for distress in the diagnostic criteria (“clinically significant”, “marked”, “excessive”, etc.) suggests that distress is construed as a dimensional construct that is being truncated to be employed as a categorical diagnostic criterion, but the diagnostic systems do not assess the degree of distress and do not provide further clarification about the cut-off between distress that is and is not diagnostically important. \r\n\r\nThe potential removal of functional impairment from the diagnostic criteria brings the non-specific and inconsistent usage of distress in DSM-IV and ICD-10 into a much clearer focus, because the most common current usage of distress is as a co-equal measure of severity with functional impairment. There have been a wide range of definitions of distress in the literature 4, but there is still no general consensus and it is unlikely that one will emerge in the foreseeable future. Thus, if DSM-V and ICD-11 intend to maintain the term, an unambiguous operational definition that clearly distinguishes distress from depression and anxiety needs to be included in the glossary, and a method for rating the severity of distress must be developed. \r\n\r\nIf it is not possible to develop a unique, non-overlapping operational definition of distress, I would recommend dropping distress entirely from the diagnostic criteria and from the assessment of functional impairment. If it is possible to develop such a definition, I would recommend using distress as one of the dimensional components of the functional impairment assessment for all disorders (i.e., not part of the diagnostic criteria) and, perhaps, as a required or optional symptom for some specific diagnoses.",

      "title": "Doctor patient communication Content or process",
      "abstract": "In the doctor-patient interview, there is a tendency to think of a dichotomy between content or background (the patient's complaint, his symptoms, medical decision-making subject to evidence -evidence-based medicine (EBM)-, drug prescription, etc.) and the process or form of the interview (the modality of the doctor-patient relationship, empathy/assertiveness, sympathy, compassion, transference and countertransference, the placebo effect, etc.). This approach is as reductionist as the usual mind-body dualism. And the problem is that, as in the bio-psychosocial (BPS) approach, the holistic content-process approach to doctor-patient communication has not been integrated into the daily practice of general practitioners (GPs) with little time, who care for most patients with acute and chronic, physical and mental illnesses [1, 2]. General Medicine (GM) presents special characteristics that differentiate it from other medical specialties. In GM it is necessary to evaluate the presentation of symptoms, in addition to the symptoms themselves. That is, the reason for the consultation initiates or emphasizes important issues for the pat ient, and not just symptoms, in a communication context [3, 4]. GPs often assume that in consultation the patient will ment ion the most important symptoms and signs in relation to it, and that patients will spontaneously report all their fears and worries; neither of these assumptions is true (5). When a pat ient comes to the office, the GP must face a certain amount of uncertainty about the evaluation and optimal treatment of it. Uncertainty is frequently represented in terms of probability or normative reasoning, and EBM. But, the reason for consultation expressed by the patient is only a manifest content. The GP must transform or complete those ideas that are latent or initially hidden [6, 7]. Symptoms are often \"disorganized\", not readily recognizable, and can be presented by symbols, as does the arrangement of notes in a musical score. Perhaps the family doctor has to approach the symptoms as if they were \"music\": like a mysterious constellation; seeking order in disorder, or better trying to understand some of the disorder [8]. The symptom is an indicator of a process that is not always fully visible. The loss of internal balance manifests itself in the body in the form of a symptom. In addition, the symptom is not an enemy whose destruction should be the main objective, but can be an ally to find the disease. In reality, the symptom indicates what the patient “misses” (9). The GP try of knowing the latent material by means of “reading the patient’s manifest signs and symbols”. The messages of our patients contain “facts” and “feelings”, and we must be attent ive and understand the emotional messages. The reason for consultation / symptom / manifest problem that the patient initially expresses is a “symbolic representation” (with universal and particular symbols); and in addition, the doctor looks for what seems to be the cause of the patient's problem in the doctor-patient relationship itself [10]. The process of communication or presentation of the reason for the visit that the patient makes to the doctor is itself a content of the health problem, it gives information about the psychic life, and it can be a signal that tells the doctor which direction to take [11-13]. In order to fully understand the symptom we must distance ourselves from the usual valuations. It is convenient to replace an excessively analytical and rational thought, with another plastic, symbolic and analogical one. Illness is a system of interpretation; and to understand disease we have to see a system of relationships. The emotional response expressed by the patient has the effect of a linguistic transfer from social complexity to psychic complexity. Illness is expressed as a contrast –not as its own unequivocal entity, but as a contrast between relationship systems-, as in painting a contour, a line, appears from the contrast between two colours instead of how a line is actually drawn [14].",

      "abstract": "[ES]La falta de adherencia a la medicacion se produce en todos los trastornos medicos cronicos. Sin embargo, constituye un desafio particular en los trastornos psicoticos debido a la asociacion de estas enfermedades con elementos tan cruciales como el deterioro cognitivo, la depresion, el abuso comorbido de sustancias, la falta de conciencia de enfermedad, la estigmatizacion o el aislamiento social. Aunque en multiples ocasiones se muestra como un aspecto encubierto y, esta subestimada incluso por los propios clinicos, la falta de adherencia terapeutica afecta a mas de un tercio de los pacientes con psicosis, aumenta el riesgo de recaida y rehospitalizacion y se asocia a una importante disminucion de la calidad de vida de nuestros enfermos. Ademas, una buena adherencia terapeutica es el resultado de la interaccion de multiples factores relacionados con la enfermedad, los psicofarmacos, el medico, los distintos dispositivos de la red asistencial, el entorno psicosocial y el propio paciente, sin que hasta el momento actual exista un instrumento estandar para su medicion, aunque existe un interes creciente por los recordatorios electronicos y sistemas de seguimiento como los mensajes cortos de texto y la monitorizacion de los psicofarmacos mediante los contenedores inteligentes de pildoras. Entre las estrategias empleadas para mejorar la adherencia a la medicacion se incluyen medidas tan diversas como la psicoeducacion, las intervenciones psicosociales, el empleo de antipsicoticos de accion prolongada, las intervenciones basadas en los servicios, los incentivos financieros, el tratamiento obligatorio comunitario, la simplificacion del regimen terapeutico, la toma de decisiones compartida, la evaluacion periodica de la adhesion, el fortalecimiento de la alianza terapeutica, la gestion de los efectos secundarios o la mejora en la comunicacion medico-paciente. Estas pinceladas a cerca de los aspectos que son objeto actual de estudio en el campo de la adherencia a los psicofarmacos en las personas que padecen algun tipo de trastorno psicotico tratan de introducirnos en el enmaranado contexto en el que se encuadra nuestra investigacion, que aumenta su nivel de complejidad cuando implantamos el segundo elemento a estudio, el insight o conciencia de enfermedad. La falta de insight es un aspecto cardinal en la psicosis aunque, ni mucho menos, se trata de un elemento expresado de forma universal y uniforme por los pacientes que la padecen. Sin embargo, es un importante predictor de resultados asociado a la adherencia a la medicacion, la frecuencia de recaidas, la remision de la sintomatologia, el funcionamiento psicosocial, el riesgo de violencia o el nivel profesional, entre otros aspectos. El proposito de esta tesis es explorar la asociacion de ambos factores, adherencia al tratamiento y conciencia de enfermedad, ya que la escasa literatura existente ahonda en la necesidad de continuar investigando sobre estos aspectos con la finalidad de convertirlos en diana de las estrategias terapeuticas empleadas para aumentar la calidad de vida de nuestros pacientes.",

      "title": "“Impulsology” <i>A New Paradigm for Addiction</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction is a chronic relapsing disease in which compulsive seeking and participation persist despite serious negative consequences (Cam et al., 2003). Participation of the addictive behavior often induces euphoria in initiation phase, or may significantly relieve stress (Cam et al., 2003). Continued participation in the addictive behavior can lead to adaptive changes within the central nervous system that can lead to tolerance, physical dependence, sensitization, craving, and relapse (Cam et al., 2003; see Figure 13.1). Addiction closely resembles other chronic relapsing disease states such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension (Heilig et al., 2006). Although it is inappropriate to forgo the social and behavioral context of addiction, this is consistent with the therapeutic approach of other chronic relapsing disease states. Unfortunately, addiction is viewed by many to result from deficits in character such as ‘‘willpower,’’ not amenable to comprehensive medical care (Heilig et al., 2006). The impulsive nature of addictive behavior renders the disease susceptible to societal judgment of patient character. Character judgment is often based upon the social and legal acceptance of the addictive behavior, rather than the multifaceted consequences of the behavior itself.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Sequelae of Severe Closed Head Injury",
      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "title": "The Seesaw Brain: \"Highs\" and Adaptations",
      "abstract": "Abstract The brain resists any disturbance in its neurochemical equilibrium. It recognizes a chemical change immediately, then adapts to it slowly. An addictive drug that mimics or blocks a neurotransmitter or receptor is like a weight thrown suddenly onto one side (let’s call it the drug side) of a balanced seesaw. The sum of all the adaptations is like a counterweight added slowly to the opposite side (the adapting side) until the level state is reached again. If a drug floods the brain suddenly (a drug spike), an immediate change in brain function results. In the vernacular, if this effect is hedonic (pleasurable), it is called a drug “high;” the drug side of the seesaw drops. If the same drug is trickled slowly into the brain instead of spiking, adaptations can occur even while the drug level is increasing; the “high” is muted or nearly absent, while a plateau drug level is established.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings, and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Research suggests a link between depressed mood and monoamine depletion, elevated cortisol, and inflammation, but existing laboratory evidence is inconclusive. Current treatments for depression include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and lifestyle changes; however, more severe forms of the disorder can require other medication, sometimes in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Disagreement persists over how to define and classify depression, in part due to its ambivalent relationship to melancholia, which has existed as a medical concept in different forms since antiquity. Melancholia was reconfigured in 19th-century medicine from traditional melancholy madness into a modern mood disorder. In the early 20th century, melancholia gradually fell out of use as a diagnostic term with the introduction of manic-depressive insanity and unipolar depression. Following the publication of <italic>DSM-III</italic> in 1980 and the introduction of SSRIs a few years later, major depressive disorder became ubiquitous. Consumption of antidepressants have continued to rise year after year, and the World Health Organization notes depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide. At present, internationally recognized systems of classification favor a single category for depressive illness (alongside a circular mood disorder, bipolar I and II), but this view is challenged by clinicians and researchers who argue for the reinstatement of melancholia as a separate and distinct mood disorder with marked somatic and psychotic features.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic illness characterized by a disorder of thought, perception, emotion, and behavior. The common presentation in patients with schizophrenia is delusion, hallucination, disorganized speech, and behavior. A rare variety of schizophrenia known as nuclear schizophrenia which was described by Langfeldt presents as depersonalization, derealization, emotional blunting, and autistic features. Currently, the concept of nuclear schizophrenia is no longer described in prevalent classification systems of ICD-10 or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 th Edition (DSM-5). We present cases of three male patients, aged between 16 and 25 years who presented to us in the outpatient department with the chief complaints of depersonalization, derealization, social aloofness, and a decline in social and academic and/or occupational functioning. The patients had an insidious and unremitting illness. These patients had different diagnoses during their course of illness and all had been diagnosed with depersonalization-derealization disorder once. We diagnosed them with unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as per the current classification, but all of them had nuclear schizophrenia symptoms based on Langfeldt’s description. We started them on second-generation antipsychotics in adequate doses to which they showed a response. The phenomenology of each of the three cases takes us back to the concept of nuclear schizophrenia which has been lost to a time in the current diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 and DSM-5. Such cases are often not reported or diagnosed under the dissociative disorder spectrum. Our case series is a sincere attempt to highlight nuclear schizophrenia and the approach we took for its management.",

      "abstract": "A consequence of repeated use of cocaine or other drugs of abuse is a transition in drug consumption from a casual and recreational style of use to a more compulsive and excessive pattern. Acute administration of psychomotor stimulants is associated with numerous effects that can contribute to casual drug consumption, including feelings of euphoria and increased energy, which can contribute to repeated recreational consumption. However, chronic administration of psychomotor stimulants results in the emergence of persistent craving and paranoia that contributes to compulsive drug-taking behavior (1,2). The transition in drug use from casual to compulsive likely occurs as a result of drug-induced plasticity in brain functioning that is pathogenic for the relapse of drug-taking behavior (3,4). Accordingly, identification of drug-induced plasticity that underlies the emergence and maintenance of compulsive drug-taking behavior is considered to be critical to the development of effective pharmacotherapies. Toward this end, the circuitry underlying compulsive drug-taking behavior must be delineated in order to narrow the search for drug-induced plasticity. Next, plasticity in brain functioning occurring following drug administration must be identified. Finally, the relevance of plasticity to drug-seeking behavior should be determined because plasticity in brain functioning could contribute, oppose, or be unrelated to compulsive drug-seeking behavior.",

The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

Abstract Alcohol and substance addiction is a chronic disease and continues throughout individual's life once after addiction develops. Therefore its natural course is characterized by remissions and relapses. In addiction, relapse periods can be followed by remission periods and individuals encounter with negative effects of alcohol and substances in these relapse periods. Many factors have been defined to determine the risk of relapse up to the date. These factors can be situational or personal and they also have physiological bases. Interaction of these factors with each other is critical in terms of relapse. Relapse is a quite well studied area in the literature, in order to prevent the individuals from restarting alcohol and substance use again. Defining the challenges of addicted patients in remis- sion periods and recurrent periods of relapse in detail will guide clinicians to determine treatment strategies in addiction and to prevent subsequent relapse periods.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

Excessive caffeine ingestion leads to symptoms that overlap with those of many psychiatric disorders. Caffeine is implicated in the exacerbation of anxiety and sleep disorders, and people with eating disorders often misuse it. It antagonises adenosine receptors, which may potentiate dopaminergic activity and exacerbate psychosis. In psychiatric in-patients, caffeine has been found to increase anxiety, hostility and psychotic symptoms. Assessment of caffeine intake should form part of routine psychiatric assessment and should be carried out before prescribing hypnotics. Gradual reduction in intake or gradual substitution with caffeine-free alternatives is probably preferable to abrupt cessation. Decaffeinated beverages should be provided on psychiatric wards.",

      "abstract": "In order to clarify the confused conception about so-called cenesthopathy, a pricise clinical and follow-up study was made on 22 patients who presented peculiar cenesthopathic complaints during long terms. Such cases as organic diseases, apparent schizophrenia and depression were excluded.The author could classify them into 5 groups. The 1st group is neurotic cases. The 2nd group is schizophrenic cases shifted from so-called borderline cases. The 3rd group is the cases of paranoid reaction. The 4th group is borderline cases in adolescence. The last 5th group is the cases unable to be classified into any groups above mentioned, and shows most characteristic symptoms.The distinguishing traits of 5th group were as follows. They developed symptoms in middle ages after being affected psychologically or physically. The persistent abnormal cenesthesia full of agony was rather tinged with hallucination, and it was some experience of moving, tense or pulling sensations, or of utterly new strange foreign sensations. Despite the peculiar strange complaints, they did not make pathological interpretations and their insight into their morbid states was preserved to some extent. But, pathological obsessive attitudes (such as skin-rubbing) and temporary abulic states often appeared, so that in their course they wore temporarily psychotic feature. Despite the chronic course, schizophrenic tendency did not appear.The author discussed the psychopathology of cenesthopathy and concluded that the 5th group should be diagnosed as typical cenesthopathia.",

Besides, using it in the treatment of depression, it is found to be effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms due to smoking cessation. A 28-year-old female patient with a history of depression was admitted to emergency department an hour after ingestion of bupropion, quetiapine, and levothyroxine in high doses to commit suicide. While accepting her into the Intensive Care Unit, she was awake, alert, disoriented and agitated. After 2h, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The necessary treatment was given and 9h later with hemodynamic improvement, the patients' mental status improved.

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently; interventions would aim to achieve different outcomes. Therefore, young people with physical impairments or both physical impairments and intellectual impairments will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., allowing sufficient time between activities for children with impairments to toilet), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with severe impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, and health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with intellectual impairments. For example, social activities may be designed such that children and adolescents with intellectual impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Skills training, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g. family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than individuals with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may increase social participation for many people, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, older adults, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent intellectual impairments. Young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; [Varni 2005]) and (b) specific measures designed for children with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001). 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones and acquisition of skills. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers). The following databases will be searched electronically: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) EMBASE LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts) BIDS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS] on Bath Information and Data Services [BIDS]) C2-SPECTR (The Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register) Dissertations Abstracts A (Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences) EconLit ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) PsycINFO Sociological Abstracts SIGLE search (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Artikelsök DIVA Handicat Hicat LIBRIS LIBRIS Uppsök SveMed+ Danbib Medline will be searched using the following terms: 1 Home Care Services/ 2 Activities of Daily Living/ 3 Personal Health Services/ 4 (personal adj2 assist$).mp.

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, the most intense service or the service that best follows the goals of personal assistance (e.g., services that give users more control) will be included in the meta-analysis. If a single eligible intervention group is compared to multiple eligible control groups, ‘no-treatment’ controls will be chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses. For studies that do not have no-treatment condition, the most common intervention in clinical practice will be chosen to maximise the external validity of the results. When a single study provides multiple measures of the same outcome, we will report all measures. For example, if a study includes two measures of quality of life (either measures completed by the same respondent or measures completed by different respondents), we will report both of them. If measures of an outcome are combined for meta-analysis, we will conduct multiple meta-analyses if multiple studies report multiple measures that can be combined in this way. If we conduct meta-analyses in which only one effect estimate can be used from each study, we will select one measure if it is more valid or reliable than the others. For example, if a single respondent completes both a validated scale assessing multiple domains of quality of life and an unvalidated visual analogue scale, we will select the validated scale. If a study includes several equally valid measures and only one effect estimate can be used for meta-analysis, we will calculate the average effect for this purpose (e.g. the average SMD or RR weighted by variance). When necessary, the corresponding author will be contacted to supply any unreported data (e.g., group means and standard deviations (SDs), details of dropouts, and details of interventions received by the control group). Other authors will be contacted if necessary. If a study reports outcomes only for participants completing the trial or only for participants who followed the protocol, authors will be contacted and asked to provide additional information to permit an intention-to-treat analyses. RevMan 4.2 will be used to perform the following calculations. Within studies, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated for comparisons of dichotomous outcome measures. Mean differences, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs will be calculated for comparisons of continuous outcome measures. Meta-analyses may be conducted to combine comparable outcome measures across studies. All overall effects will be calculated using inverse variance methods. Random-effects models will be used because studies may include somewhat different treatments or populations. Dichotomous outcome measures may be combined by calculating an overall RR and 95% CI. Continuous outcome measures may be combined when means and standard deviations or complete significance testing statistics are available, unless statistical tests assuming normality would be inappropriate. For example, for scales beginning with a finite number (such as 0), effect estimates will not be combined unless a mean is greater than its standard deviation (otherwise the mean would be very unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution). If continuous outcomes are measured identically across studies, an overall weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI may be calculated. If the same continuous outcome is measured differently across studies, an overall standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI may be calculated (Higgins 2005). SMDs will be calculated using Hedges g. Studies in which participants are analysed as members of the groups to which they were originally assigned (intention-to-treat analysis), studies that include only those participants who were willing or able to provide data (available-case analysis), and studies that analyse participants who adhered to the study's design (per-protocol analysis; (Higgins 2005) will be analysed separately. Studies in which the reasons for excluding participants from analyses can not be determined from relevant reports or through contact with the authors will be considered with per-protocol analyses. The consistency of results will be assessed using the I2 statistic (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003). If there is evidence of heterogeneity (Q-statistic p less than or equal to 0.1 coupled with an I2 value of 25% or greater), the authors will consider sources according to pre-specified subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses (below) but will not report an overall estimate of effect size. If heterogeneity remains within these subgroups, the review will report the results on a trial-by-trial basis, in a narrative summary. Large numbers of subgroups may lead to misleading conclusions and are best kept to a minimum (Counsell 1994; Oxman 1992; Yusuf 1991). If possible, this review will include separate effect estimates for the following subgroups: 1) Organisation of services Personal assistance organised by user representatives (e.g., through direct payment schemes) will be considered apart from personal assistance organised and managed by others (e.g., social workers or government agencies). 2) Acquisition of impairment Separate effects will be reported for children and adolescents who had impairments from birth, who have long-standing impairments, and who recently acquired impairments. 3) Amount of assistance The number of hours of assistance received per week is related to user needs, which are determined by social context, the availability of other services, severity of impairments, etc. Separate effect estimates will be reported for users receiving different levels of assistance (e.g., 20-50 hours, 51-80 hours, more than 80 hours). Sensitivity analyses will investigate the influence of lower quality studies (i.e., those rated C and D on allocation concealment) on the results of the review. To investigate the possibility of bias, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (Deeks 2005; Egger 1997; Sterne 2001). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses. When meta-analyses are performed, data will be entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for personal assistance.

      "abstract": "Drug abuse has become a social and medical problem. Amphetamine and cocaine have a potent sympathicomimetic action, so they have important effects on the Central Nervous and Cardiovascular Systems. Their neurological complications are principally: psychic alterations, seizures and stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic). The latter are the most important in the clinical practice. Their capacity to produce transit arterial hypertension and cerebral vascular constriction could be the physiopathological substrate of such alterations. Angiographic studies have shown lesions suggesting vasculopathy. In the last ten years cocaine abuse has become an authentic epidemic. We have reviewed its neurological complications, particularly the vascular ones--42 hemorrhagic and 24 ischemic--and the following conclusions were drawn: it should be considered as a risk factor in the younger age group; a short period of time between the last drug dose and the clinical picture is frequently seen; clinical features may appear with the first drug administration; no characteristic lesion in relation to the way of administration or consumption time was elicited.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is a rare and underreported phenomenon. When patients ingest large amounts of cocaine, patients can experience seizures. Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

Those workers who would argue this point invariably introduce some special designation for the syndrome which is usually understood to be a disease entity.<sup>1</sup>My definition follows: Idiopathic epilepsy is a chronic, usually progressive, inherited disorder of the brain, characterized by periodically recurring convulsions (major seizures), lapses (minor seizures, petit mal or petit mal variant attacks) or behavior disturbances (psychomotor episodes) which occur in a person with no other demonstrable, relevant neurologic disease and with no recognized pathologic lesion except the cerebral dysrhythmia elicited by means of the electroencephalograph.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

      "title": "Pathophysiology of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also referred to diagnostically as substance dependence, is a chronically relapsing brain disorder characterized by compulsive drug taking. Different drugs produce different patterns of addiction with three stages: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. In 2005, 22 million Americans, 9% of the population aged 12 and older, experienced abuse or dependence on alcohol or an illicit drug within the prior 12 months. An additional 25.1 million experienced nicotine dependence. The stages of progression of drug use show that the use of cigarettes (nicotine) or alcohol precedes the use of marijuana (cannabis) and, in turn, the use of marijuana precedes the use of other illicit drugs. Substance abuse and addiction contribute to various medical disorders, including pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, infectious diseases (HIV and hepatitis C), and mental disorders (i.e., anxiety disorder, psychoses). It is estimated that 40–60% of the vulnerability to addiction is attributable to genetic factors. The reinforcing effects of drugs during intoxication set the initial stage that, if perpetuated, triggers the neuronal adaptations that result in addiction. At least four systems have been identified as having an important role in the acute reinforcing effects of drugs abuse: the mesolimbic dopamine system, the opioid peptide system, the γ-aminobutyric acid system, and the endocannabinoid system localized to key circuits in the basal forebrain, including the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Repeated perturbation of reward circuits (e.g., marked dopamine increases followed by dopamine decreases) results in consequent disruption of the circuits that it regulates (motivation/drive, memory/learning, and control). Addiction also involves a long-term, persistent plasticity in the activity of neural circuits mediating motivational systems that derives from recruitment of brain stress systems such as corticotropin-releasing factor that drive negative emotional states. Abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate gyrus in drug-addicted subjects lead to inadequate decisions that favor immediate rewards over delayed but more favorable responses. The changes in plasticity of these circuits have been hypothesized to involve molecular neuroadaptations such as changes in intracellular signal transduction and/or changes in transcription of particular target genes that can lead to long-term altered neuronal activity and vulnerability to reentering the addictive cycle.",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

It is seen in temporal lobe epilepsy (12), temporal lobe migrane (22), depression (8), LSD intoxication (20), schizophrenia (1), phobic anxiety states (15), sleep deprivation (2) and the hypnagogic state. Shorvon (21) reported cases of depersonalization occurring in the apparent absence of other psychiatric disorder, and Davison (4) investigated in detail seven such cases. Finally the occurrence of depersonalization in people not attending psychiatric or neurological clinics is now well attested (13, 5, 18, 6).",

Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

Despite distinct pharmacological targets, all have the common property to stimulate the brain reward circuitry, which results in an increase of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The stimulation induced by drugs of abuse is much more important in intensity and duration than the stimulation induced by natural rewards. The positive reinforcement resulting from this stimulation promotes repeated drug intake, which induces cellular and molecular adaptations in the brain reward circuit and other regions associated with this circuit. Enduring changes are more particularly observed in regions involved in pleasure, motivation, memory, conditioning, executive functions, judgement and self-control. A tolerance to the reinforcing effects of natural rewards is observed in parallel to a hypersensitivity to the motivational effects of drugs and drug-associated stimuli. Behaviour focuses more and more exclusively on drug research and drug consumption.

      "title": "General Principles for Psychotherapeutic Interventions in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders often go unrecognized in our country, despite this subpopulation constituting one of the largest segments of the whole population. Proper assessment and management of different psychiatric disorders at this age are of paramount importance, which will ultimately impact the course and outcome of the particular condition at later age.[1] Although medicines/drugs are required to treat many of these disorders, psychotherapeutic interventions remain a preferred choice for clinicians as well as for parents and family members. Assessing children and adolescents throws up multiple challenges to a treating physician. First, a child/adolescent may disagree with the parents or the doctor regarding the need for consultation or would not have come for the consultation in the first place. Second, the child/adolescent could have come for an entirely different problem, whereas the main problem remains unnoticed by the caregivers.[2] Moreover, children may report their symptoms but may not provide other details, such as duration and chronology of their symptoms. They may also hide the problem if it depicts them in a bad light or are embarrassing for them. Therefore, a clinician should gather information from multiple sources, i.e., the child, parents, teachers, and other caregivers. An elaborate history-taking by an astute clinician helps in proper case formulation and embarking upon a psychotherapeutic procedure.[2] There can be discrepancies in the report; nevertheless, multi-source information minimizes error in diagnosis and management. Psychotherapy is a form of psychiatric treatment that involves therapeutic conversations and interactions between a therapist and a child or family. It can help children and families understand and resolve problems, modify behavior, and make positive changes in their lives. The term \"psychotherapy\" usually includes supportive, re-educative, and psychoanalytic forms of psychotherapy. All can be used to treat child and adolescent psychiatric disorders depending on the kind of problem we encounter in clinical practice. Various forms of psychotherapy that are used in the treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders include acceptance and commitment therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy, family therapy, group therapy, Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), mentalization-based therapy, parent–child interaction therapy, play therapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy. Before we embark on a psychotherapeutic engagement with a child or adolescent, we must be very sure regarding the nature of the problem at hand and what exactly we need to address or which behavior we want to modify. Parents also at times come up with unusual demands which are not keeping with the changing social milieu or in direct conflict with changing times (e.g., demanding a bar on the use of mobile phones completely for a 15-year-old adolescent). This guideline outlines the special considerations that a clinician/counselor needs to make while doing psychotherapeutic interventions in children and adolescents. This guideline attempts to cover the important areas in this topic with focus on certain clinical conditions. However, this guideline is far from exhaustive and modifications may be necessary according to the clinical condition at hand. For purpose of this guideline, the term \"child\"/\"children\" will be used in references to children and adolescents. The term \"child\" and \"adolescent\" will be used for all children between 0 and 12 years of age and between 13 and 18 years of age, respectively.[2] DATA SEARCH METHODOLOGY The data search strategies for this clinical practice guideline included electronic databases as well as hand-search of relevant books, publications, or cross-references. The electronic search included PubMed and other search engines (e.g., Google Scholar and PsycINFO). Cross-searches of electronic and hand-search key references often yielded other relevant materials. The search terms used, in various combinations, were behavior therapy, psychotherapy, counseling, children, adolescents, etc. ESTABLISHING THE CONTEXT While working as a professional with families, one needs to listen carefully and take different perspectives into consideration. The professional needs to be able to appreciate and see the world from a child or adolescent's eyes as well as from those of their parents. Childhood and adolescence are times of first encounters and intense experiences in the present. They are periods full of joy and sadness, excitement, and fear, as well as rapid growth and new learning. To engage children and adolescents as professionals, we need to take time to appreciate their experience and to understand the world they move in while recognizing their relationships with their families.[3] When we engage with children, we also engage with their parents and the other significant members of their families. To be effective, we need to be sensitive to and appreciate the experience of being a parent in its ups and downs and its joys and sorrows. The lives of children and parents are so inextricably linked that we can hardly help one without helping the other.[3] Parents who bring their children to therapy also bring their own needs, concerns, and wishes. If we help parents with their own concerns, then we also help their children, and if we help children to change positively, then we also help their parents who care for them. Working effectively with families also involves appreciating and understanding the professional context from which we operate. As professionals we bring our own perspective, and that of our profession, to the therapeutic process. This includes our personal style and beliefs as workers, the theoretical models we subscribe to, the standing and context of the agency we work for, and the values and goals of our profession as a whole.[3] From a collaborative perspective, it is best to follow clients' preferences in deciding what way to intervene to help them. Of course, this is not without limits as professional responses to client(s) goals are largely determined by the function and context of the professional agency. For example, it would be advisable to run therapeutic groups with children in a school set-up, where they would be an attentive audience, compared to parents. The opposite is true for an adolescent mental health setting, where parents would be keen listeners, while the adolescents would prefer to stay away. There are many different therapeutic models and ways to provide therapeutic services [Box 1], all of which have validity.[3] For example, behavior problems can be improved by either working with the parents, or with the children, or with both as a family unit.Box 1: Possible therapeutic interventionsESTABLISHING THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE Counseling or working with children and adolescents therapeutically is a very different process than counseling adults. Children inhabit a different world than that of the adult and are at a different developmental level. They do not share the adult preference for language and verbal communication and the rules of adult conversation just do not apply to how children relate. Children like to communicate through play and creative activities [Box 2] as well as through conversation. Even adolescents who may appear to be more able to engage in adult conversation are at a transitional stage in their lives and share many of the preferences of younger children for structured activities and indirect and imaginative forms of communication.[3]Box 2: Creative therapeutic activitiesEstablishing a rapport with children is extremely essential, and it should not be sacrificed for practicing purely paternalistic way of medicine. Clinician should respect child's autonomy, while at the same time, he/she should not compromise with what is best for the child. The best form of practice is shared decision-making, with selective paternalism where needed, while working with children and families.[4] While establishing rapport, clinician must not assume that communicating with parents is enough and that whatever intervention he/she applies is routed through the parents. Clinicians' and therapists' interaction with the child may have a bearing on intervention outcomes. Even though the child is reluctant about the need for a consultation, he/she is usually aware of the events and/or discussions that happen around him/her. Therefore, a face-to-face conversation with the child, with the acknowledgment of child's understanding of his/her problem, is fruitful in the long run.[2] Play therapists are experts in using creative media to engage children in therapeutic conversation.[3] Ideally, they work within a designated play therapy room that has access to sand and water play, painting and artwork, dress-up materials, dolls, puppets, and construction play materials. While as a professional working in a different context (such as a child protection worker or a family therapist) you may not have access to a designated room or such an elaborate range of materials, it is still important to have access to some creative activities to complement verbal conversation fully to engage children and adolescents. Challenges in establishing rapport Clinician may face a huge hurdle in establishing rapport with the child when the remains mute during consultation. There can be several reasons for it. The clinician should examine various possibilities and manage them as they come. This usually warrants some extra time and labor on part of the clinician.[2] Table 1 enumerates the conditions that pose a challenge in establishing rapport and how to overcome the same.Table 1: Challenges in establishing rapportTREATMENT SETTINGS Psychotherapy for children and adolescents can be done in outpatient department, in inpatient setting, and/or in a consultation-liaison set-up. Whether done in an inpatient setting or outpatient department, the clinical setting should provide for adequate engagement of the child for the requisite length of time. The following factors need to be considered: Meeting a doctor can be intimidating for the children. Long waiting period can make them uncooperative and irritable during the interview Child clinics should have an attractive appearance, and toys, books, coloring pencils, and gaming zone should be made available. Walls painted in bright colors, with fables and cartoon characters, help in drawing attention of the child, and the child would be more happy to come back to the place, in case subsequent consultations are required The clinic can have few large blackboards with colored chalks to engage the child. Toys, papers, coloring pencils, Rubik cubes, and puzzle games should be there in the consultation room Drawing and play activities can help establishing rapport with the child and can be used as assessment tools, particularly with preschool children who may not be able to express their distressing experience verbally. All staff members in such clinics need to be trained in handling child and should be able to engage in activities with them.[2] When done in a consultation liaison setting: The therapist should be sensitive to the severity of the physical illness the child/adolescent is suffering from Ideally, one of the parents or a caregiver should be present to make the child comfortable His/her privacy should be respected; if possible, he/she should be taken to a separate interview room for initial assessment Too long interviews are discouraged, and therapist may have to depend on the caregivers as the primary source of information. Frequent visit to the child or adolescent may be required Therapy should be limited to crisis intervention during the length of hospital stay, and once the child or adolescent is stabilized/discharged, he/she can be taken up for psychotherapy in an outpatient setting or he/she can be transferred to a psychiatry inpatient set-up and psychotherapeutic intervention can continue there. ENGAGING PARENTS AS AGENTS OF BEHAVIOUR CHANGE The decision to bring a child for psychological help is generally taken within the family. The cultural values of each household might also decide what type of childhood difficulties is regarded as serious which warrants intervention. These values may additionally decide whether intervention is specially welcomed, resented, or feared. Because the family context is crucial in deciding a child's mindset toward psychological help, most of the child psychotherapists would like to meet the total family together as part of the preliminary assessment. Family meetings not solely provide a useful chance to discuss the total family's mindset toward referral but are also commonly an extra reliable way of mastering about family relationships than something the mother and father or youngsters can individually report. In working with parents, the therapist offers a structure of how to respond to emotional misery which has some core elements: The first and foremost is to establish a dependable setting in which it is viable to discuss very upsetting things. As with a child's treatment, sessions for mother and father have regularity in time and space, and this helps to contain the childish elements which are aroused The second thing is the creation with the dad or mom of some shared language to describe painful emotional states. Finding phrases for despair/sorrow/anguish is a help in itself because it offers the comfort of feeling understood. Many lonely or emotionally-disadvantaged mother and father may discover the resources for understanding their kids through the journey of feeling understood and perception their personal kids through the trip of feeling understood Third is the valuing of boundaries and differentiation: differences between parents and children and between experiences on her/his behalf. Perhaps, this might be likened to the ordinary behavior of a crying infant; however, when the baby gets no response, the screams stay lodged in the baby's head in an unbearable way Fourth, parents may be a very useful agent in implementing certain therapeutic principles for the child or adolescent behavioral problem at home setting, e.g., time out, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, time management, activity scheduling, conducting exposure and response prevention sessions, and helping the child to complete home assignments given the therapist Fifth, some mother and father are more responsive to group therapy. The group provides the alleviation that others, too, share a sense of failure, whether it be losing one's temper, failing to drop the child to school on time or to make him/her sleep at the desired time at night, or bearing with child's failure at school, quarrelsomeness with siblings or delinquent behavior. Group work looks to be helpful when there is an experience of social isolation, robust feelings of failure, and an absence of supportive partners. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT BEFORE THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC ENGAGEMENT The goal of clinical assessment is to have a case formulation that would help in deciding the management.[8] Signs and symptoms as narrated by the child and caregivers or elicited by the clinician help in ascertaining the key areas that need to be addressed and also confirm or refute the presence/absence of a mental disorder. While doing an assessment, it is vital for the clinician to see the child in a psychosocial background, considering all the possible factors that could have played a role in precipitating and maintaining the particular disorder/behavioral problem, and to gather every detail regarding the illness so far, including the treatment history. Therapeutic alliance is very crucial in this context. If the child and his/her caregivers perceive a mutually beneficial relationship, the elicitation of facts becomes quite easy and so as the treatment which is then shared by the family also.[2] A good clinical assessment also provides a window of opportunity for the family/caregivers to reflect upon their own difficulties and working through it. Assessment also helps in deciding the nature of psychotherapy that has to be planned – whether it will be a short-term/long-term psychotherapy; crisis intervention/supportive kind of psychotherapy, or more extensive behavior therapy, or more rigorous psychodynamic psychotherapy to solve deep-rooted psychological conflict. Table 2 lists certain items which the clinician/psychologist should consider while planning psychotherapeutic interventions in children and adolescents.Table 2: Points to consider in clinical assessment from psychotherapeutic point of viewASSESSMENT FOR SUITABILITY FOR PSYCHOTHERAPY Not every child can be taken up for psychotherapy. Before we consider a psychotherapeutic intervention for a child or adolescent, multiple factors need to be considered – nature of diagnosis, availability of alternative mode of treatment (particularly medicines) and how effective are they, client choice, motivation for engagement, availability of time both on the part of the parents and the therapist, ability to pay for the sessions, expertise of the therapist in that particular type of psychotherapeutic intervention, and intelligence level of the child/adolescent. Supportive psychotherapy may be suitable for all age groups, whereas a more elaborative kind of psychotherapy, e.g., CBT or psychodynamic psychotherapy is suitable for older children or adolescents. Table 3 shows the factors to be considered for suitability for psychotherapy in children and adolescent.Table 3: Factors to be considered in evaluation for psychotherapyAnnexure 1 shows the template of a psychotherapy intake form for children and adolescents. Once the suitability for psychotherapy has been assessed, the sessions can start. Box 3 shows the do's and don'ts of psychotherapy with children and adolescents.[9]Box 3: Do's and Don'ts of psychotherapyInitial psychotherapy sessions with children and adolescents can be very challenging due to the need to balance assessment, relationship building, caretaker/parent management, and case formulation with a client population that sometimes has little motivation for psychotherapy. STRUCTURING PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC SESSIONS Shea proposed five stages of psychotherapeutic sessions: (a) the introduction, (b) the opening, (c) the body, (d) the closing, and (e) termination.[10] Introduction and opening There is something unique regarding the first contact between the child and the therapist. Because of formative issues and either negative desires or prompt negative transference responses, beginning associations can be expressly protective and antagonistic. It is not uncommon for juvenile customers to come up in the session and saying things such as \"I'm not conversing with you and you can't make me!\" In such cases, setting up remedial collusion (portrayed prior) previously might be very useful. Another underlying contact procedure or system is to give constructive consideration and show enthusiasm for the customer's novel individual characteristics. This could incorporate giving a genuine commendation on the customer's dress or communicating an enthusiasm for something the customer brought to treatment. Secrecy is regularly an essential issue of worry for young people and ought to be talked about straightforwardly and legitimately. Psychotherapists ought to likewise impart referral data to customers. Children may ask why they have been referred and may assume that the referral clinician has provided inaccurate clinical data regarding him/her to the psychotherapist.[10] When working with grown-ups, specialists frequently ask things such as \"What brings you for consultation\" or \"How could I help you.\" These openings are inappropriate for psychotherapy with kids and young people since they expect the nearness of knowledge, inspiration, and a craving for help – which could conceivably be right. Opening sentences that put importance on collaboration, emphasizing disclosure, and beginning a process of in-depth exploration of client goals are more appropriate in such scenario. For instance, \"I'd prefer to begin by revealing to you how I like to function with kids and young people. I'm keen on helping you be fruitful. That is my objective, to assist you with being effective in here or out on the planet. I will likely assist you with achieving your objectives. Be that as it may, there's a farthest point on that. My objectives are your objectives just as long as your objectives are lawful and solid.\" Body When working with children, the essential errands related with the body or center phase of the underlying meeting for the most part include evaluation, job acceptance (i.e., clarifying the diagnosis and treatment approaches in detail), and possibly beginning of a psychological intervention.[10] Executing formal evaluation systems (e.g., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and Rorschach) can be tricky with youths since they may not be fully aware of the requirement of such procedure or may be unduly suspicious of the motive of such procedure. Along these lines, psychotherapists ought to clarify and outline the reason and procedure of assessment.[11] Given the potential for youths to utilize carrying on safeguard components, holding on to manage tests until a sufficient helpful relationship has been set up is probably going to yield progressively substantial evaluation information. Meanwhile, less conventional appraisal strategies, for example, the wishes and goals and family constellation procedures, can be utilized to establish the therapeutic relationship and gather evaluation information. Clinically, it would be prudent that psychotherapists ought not to depend exclusively on verbal conversations while treating children. Clinicians can intentionally choose games, toys, expressive art supplies, and different objects of attraction for their clinic. Children may not be comfortable to use talking as a mode of self-improvement. Children can be encouraged to talk more freely by simple activities, e.g., modeling a piece of clay. The central matter of the story is that we ought not expect that children should discuss individual issues with an obscure adult from the beginning of therapy.[12] It is a rule rather than exception that psychotherapists will be able to execute formal therapy during initial few sessions with children. Be that as it may, like the utilization of preliminary translations in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, it is feasible for psychotherapists to utilize a mellow understanding or relational input and afterward check the customer's reaction. Closing and termination Time management is the central topic of closing and termination. The end starts when 5–10 min is still left in the session and is the point at which the psychotherapist stops collating new information as well as does not actualize any new interventions. Closing is the ideal opportunity for consolidation and transition, yet in addition it incorporates a few meeting tasks.[12] Psychotherapists should provide children with reassurance and support toward the end of the session. This can be as straightforward as, \"I appreciated you for talking to me today\" or \"My gather that you intended not to meet me today, however you made it since we're just about completed with our session.\" Psychotherapists should provide positive feedback toward the end minutes. This feedback should be spontaneous and should include references of customer conduct during the session. Models include \"When you discussed your fellowships, I could truly perceive the amount you esteem dependability\" and \"You have an incredible comical inclination.\" Contingent upon the individual customer and the psychotherapist's hypothetical direction, it can likewise be valuable to request that the customer think about the session and remark or outline their feeling on the session's features. It is standard for the therapist to focus upon the future toward the end of the session. As this procedure unfurls, two essential issues are probably going to develop: (a) the following session and (b) potential homework. The next session The subsequent session(s) with children ought to be framed in a positive manner. Small remarks, for example, \"I would like to see you one week from now\" or \"I am glad to work with you,\" can add to setting uplifting desires. When working with young people, exceptional procedures might be utilized to fortify the treatment relationship and improve compliance. In particular, standard procedure of interpersonal psychotherapy for depression with adolescents (IPT-A) includes psychotherapists reaching the customer/parent over phone in between the first and second sessions. Potential homework CBT approaches should be included in homework for the client at the very outset.[13] However, it is essential to remember that for young people, schoolwork assignments should be moderately basic, functional, and doable; otherwise, it might evoke resistance. At times, it very well may be useful to abstain from utilizing the word \"schoolwork\" or \"homework\" with children, particularly if they recently had negative school and schoolwork encounters. Alternatives terms such as \"task,\" \"assignment,\" or \"project\" can be used. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS Cognitive behavioral therapy CBT involves that therapist and patient work as a team to examine and understand thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Children may not be able to report their own feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Moreover, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of parents and other family members may have a bearing on the child. Therefore, the following areas should be explored before starting CBT with children and families. Developmental perspective Therapist must adopt a developmental standpoint while working with youngsters and adolescents, which is critical for planning the intervention. Therapist should consider the child's stage of autonomy and independence. This means giving older adolescents enough autonomy and working through with their treatment goals and for younger adolescents making certain that they have ample help from parents and concerned caregivers. Position of caregivers and other individuals in the kid's existence should be described at the start of the therapy Role of persons and different family or systems variables must be analyzed in retaining the kid's difficulties Families, schools, and other structures may also play a pivotal role in maintaining child's symptoms by adapting to it accordingly In addition to individual session with the child, sessions focusing on parent, teacher, and other concerned adults at regular intervals are also vital Treatment in familiar and natural environment often produces faster and long-lasting benefit structured treatment sessions. Treatment ideas should be tailored to children's developmental stage for the use of CBT with teens and adolescents. For example, because of lack of abstract thinking abilities in children, efforts to address cognitive biases, and distortions underlying anxiety, depression may be met with resistance. Various techniques have been proposed to concretize goal cognitions and abstract concepts. Symptoms can be symbolized as persona that the infant can relate to who must be vanquished Obsessions in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) can be blamed on an external agent, e.g., a pesky bug, whose ideas must be fought Children can also be encouraged to play the role of detective or team up with a detective in verifying assumptions and beliefs. These developmental adaptations assist children in understanding ideas that are otherwise verbally explained, which may not be a suitable treatment vehicle for them. Cognitive behavioral play therapy With very younger kids, cognitive behavioral play therapy (CBPT) might also be indicated as it includes cognitive behavioral strategies into play-based interactions. Youngsters may have difficulty in appreciating principles of CBT; CBPT provides the opportunity for teaching and therapeutic work to happen during play. Many CBT ideas are modeled with puppets or different toys, e.g. demonstrating the child that a puppet gets over its worries the more it faces the challenges in environment. CBPT additionally borrows some principals from adult CBT, such as activity scheduling for a nonengaging child. Other developmental considerations include the child's age, verbal felicity, cognitive flexibility, and duration, intensity, and frequency of the symptoms. Younger adolescents are benefitted more from behavioral techniques than cognitive ones, mainly because they are often unable to report cognitions that accompany symptoms and behaviors Teenagers can benefit from cognitive strategies, e.g., relaxation exercises, imagery, and autosuggestions. Children over the age of 9 might have improved capacity for reporting and understanding cognitions and might gain from cognitive components of therapy Each child needs to be personally evaluated; however, competency in language skills may make the application of cognitive strategies difficult for older children as well. Family-related factors Kid's target symptoms should be seen within the family context for treatment planning in CBT. It is possible that significant others in the kid's life are accommodating the maladaptive behavior rather than discouraging it. For example, in OCD, household may additionally tolerate complex rituals that intervene with day-to-day routine activities to avoid the temper tantrum of the child when the rituals would be forced to stop. Parent/family involvement in therapy It is vital to have information about the family, and how parents think, behave, or emote, to understand the child's symptoms in a better way within a cognitive behavioral framework.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal mental functions and disturbed behavior. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on criteria defined in either the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version DSM-IV (2) or the ICD-10. Targets of treatment include positive and negative symptoms, depression, suicidal ideation and behaviors, substance use disorders, medical comorbidities, posttraumatic stress disorder, and community adjustment problems. The first-generation antipsychotics were first introduced for the treatment of schizophrenia in the 1950s. The introduction of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in the last three decades improved the desired effects of these medications with a reduction of their undesirable effects such as extrapyramidal adverse effects, mortality and metabolic disorder. Medication is generally helpful in treating positive symptoms, but up to a third of people derive little benefit, and negative symptoms are difficult to treat. It has been shown that lack of efficacy and tolerability, often associated with poor compliance, results in treatment discontinuation or treatment switch. Despite critical importance of medication for patients with schizophrenia, nonadherence to treatment is an important issue worldwide. The most prominent patient-related factors associated with nonadherence included lack of insight into the need for medication, denial of illness, embarrassment and unsuitable living conditions. Although antipsychotic medications are necessary, they are not sufficient for the treatment of schizophrenia. The cognitive therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive remediation therapy), social skills, psychoeducation programs, family intervention, training programs, and case management or assertive community treatment are the major categories of psychosocial intervention which is an important part of the disease management. The major considerations in disease management treatment include the comprehensive and continuous treatment for prolonged periods, integrated, bio-psychosocial approach to care, active collaboration with the family while planning and delivering treatment and treatment sensitive to the patient's needs and empirically titrated to the patient's response and progress.",

      "title": "Study of Adverse drug reactions and its Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this term differs from the term because side effects can be beneficial as well as detrimental. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance. An adverse drug event (ADE) refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the injury. An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown. ADRs are only one type of medication-related harm, as harm can also be caused by omitting to take indicated medications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdverse drug reactions can be considered a form of toxicity; however, toxicity is most commonly applied to effects of overingestion (accidental or intentional) or to elevated blood levels or enhanced drug effects that occur during appropriate use (eg, when drug metabolism is temporarily inhibited by a disorder or another drug). For information on toxicity of specific drugs see the table Symptoms and Treatment of Specific Poisons. Side effect is an imprecise term often used to refer to a drug’s unintended effects that occur within the therapeutic range.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the US, 3 to 7% of all hospitalizations are due to adverse drug reactions. ADRs occur during 10 to 20% of hospitalizations; about 10 to 20% of these ADRs are severe. These statistics do not include the number of ADRs that occur in ambulatory and nursing home patients. Although the exact number of ADRs is not certain, ADRs represent a significant public health problem that is, for the most part, preventable.\r\n\r\nIncidence and severity of adverse drug reactions vary by patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, ethnicity, coexisting disorders, genetic or geographic factors) and by drug factors (eg, type of drug, administration route, treatment duration, dosage, bioavailability). Incidence is higher with advanced age and polypharmacy. ADRs are more severe among the elderly (see Drug-Related Problems in Older Adults), although age per se may not be the primary cause. The contribution of prescribing and adherence errors to the incidence of ADRs is unclear.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nClassification:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdverse drug reactions are usually classified as mild, moderate, severe, or lethal. Severe or lethal ADRs may be specifically mentioned in black box warnings in the physician prescribing information provided by the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nSymptoms and signs may manifest soon after the first dose or only after chronic use. They may obviously result from drug use or be too subtle to identify as drug-related. In the elderly, subtle ADRs can cause functional deterioration, changes in mental status, failure to thrive, loss of appetite, confusion, and depression.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMechanism:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe most common mechanism for an ADR is the augmented pharmacological action, which is the known, inherent pharmacologic effect of the drug and is dose related; example insulin given for diabetes may cause hypoglycemia.  A different mechanism of ADR is drug interaction which is a reaction between two or more drugs or between a drug and a food, beverage, or supplement.  When two drugs are used together, their effects can be additive, synergistic or antagonistic.  Photosensitivity is another mechanism of ADR which could be either phototoxic or photoallergic.  Additionally, selected drugs cause drug dependence which could be psychological or physical.  Some drugs cause intolerance which is a characteristic pharmacologic effect produced by an unusually small dose, so that the usual dose tends to induce a massive overaction.  Another mechanism is teratogenicity.  A teratogen acts by different mechanisms like folate antagonism, neural crest cell disruption, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, vascular disruption, specific receptor or enzyme mediated teratogenesis. Example: Thalidomide has antiangiogenic actions which has been proposed to play a role in thalidomide teratogenesis.  Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are other mechanisms of ADRs.  Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the most common primary target for chemical carcinogen and for a single DNA polymerase, DNA damage can affect replication in different ways.  Finally, idiosyncratic reaction and drug hypersensitivity are largely unpredictable ADRs.  Affected people may have genetic differences in the way their body metabolizes or responds to drugs and this can occur even with smaller doses. Knowledge of the mechanism of ADRs can help to prevent or reduce these reactions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe FDA Adverse Event Reporting System In the United States, the primary adverse event reporting system is MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. Health care professionals and consumers voluntarily report ADRs, ADEs, and medication errors for entry into the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The events are evaluated by clinical reviewers in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). This evaluation may lead to regulatory action by the FDA, including labeling changes, communicating new safety information to the public, restricting use of the drug, or removing the drug from the market. The FDA may also require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), which are plans that use risk minimization strategies beyond professional labelling to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.",

Disorders of the nervous system can ruin the lives of individuals and are of such a magnitude that they create many of our greatest social problems. People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

This chapter explores alcohol as a major psychoactive drug. Many of the basic observations about alcohol-behaviour interactions have implications for dependence. It considers various approaches to specific aetiology of alcoholism and its treatment, before looking at drug dependence in general as an addictive process. In the field of psychopharmacology, researchers have found the effects of alcohol a useful tool in the study of fundamental psychological mechanisms, while others have been interested in such research for clinical reasons. The dangers of using a particular drug are often associated with the drug's potential to cause addiction, or physical dependence as it is commonly referred to. Habituation is the repeated use of a drug because the user finds that each use increases pleasurable feelings or reduces feelings of anxiety, fear, or stress.",

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "title": "Comorbidity and “Self-Medication”",
      "abstract": "Abstract Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception for substance use disorders, especially when they involve drugs other than alcohol. A common reaction of physicians to co-morbidity is to attribute the substance use of addicted people to \"self-medicating\" with drugs of abuse. When an individual uses an abused drug nonmedically, he or she is seeking brain reward, not treatment. To confuse this drug-using behavior with treatment is to misunderstand addictive behavior and to encourage a false sense that the primary clinical task is to lower the dysphoria associated with the comorbid condition in order to stop the nonmedical drug use. Even the most effective treatment of comorbid disorders is unlikely to halt the addictive drug use. The best way to handle comorbidity (e.g., depression and alcoholism) is to consider each of the comorbid conditions to be a separate and serious illness deserving of effective and specific treatment and not to consider one to be a \"symptom\" of the other. While it is desirable to treat all comorbid conditions using the best practices for the treatment of that condition it is not reasonable to assume that one of the comorbid disorders is secondary to the other and therefore that treatment of the \"secondary\" disorder is irrelevant or unnecessary.",

One of the still puzzling diseases with irritates doctors and patients alike is the severe drug (induced) hypersensitivity syndrome (D[i]HS), often also called drug rash (or reaction) with eosinolphilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). It appears after 2 ― 12 weeks of treatment, affects liver (hepatitis), but also other organs like the heart (carditis), lung (pneumonitis), colon (colitis) and kidney (nephritis). Most cases have an exanthema, a rather typical swelling of the face, fever and a massive eosinophilia. Eliciting drugs are antiepileptics, certain sulfanil-amides like sulfasalazin and sulfamethoxozalole, minocyclin, allopurinol and antiretroviral agents. Depending on the eliciting drug, some organs are more frequently affected than others. The diagnosis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction underlying the severe disease is often delayed and doubted, in particular as many symptoms may continue for weeks and reappear later with other, non related drugs. Recurrences of symptoms may also be precipitated around the third week by reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV-6, CMV). Since the lethality is in the range of 10%, an early diagnosis and use of corticosteroid in cases with severe organ involvement is necessary.",

      "abstract": "The construct of major depressive disorder makes no etiological assumptions about populations with diverse symptom clusters. “Depressed mood” and “loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities” are core features of a major depressive episode, though a strong case can be made to pay increasing attention to symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunction in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment outcome. Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders represent one of the leading causes of mental health related disability worldwide. Unfortunately, one-third of patients undergoing treatment with antidepressants (ADs) do not respond adequately. In this context, several new substances have recently emerged, including psychedelics, ketamine, MDMA, and cannabinoids. Regarding psychedelics, recent clinical trials have demonstrated a positive short-term response, while the long-term effects remain uncertain. Ketamine treatment has shown promising antidepressant benefits both in the short and medium term, especially when administered intravenously. On the other hand, the therapeutic effect of cannabinoids remains uncertain since there is not yet sufficient evidence to support a significant improvement in depressive symptoms. Moreover, it is crucial to consider that cannabis use has been associated with early-onset psychiatric disorders and increased risk of suicide. MDMA has achieved significant interest among the novel drugs due to its indication as an adjunct treatment to psychotherapy for patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Overall, ketamine appears, so far, to be the most effective option in sustaining remission, whereas psychedelics and MDMA may offer short-term benefits when combined with psychotherapy. While some of these treatments appear promising, further research is essential to determine their long-term therapeutic viability and to identify biomarkers predictive of treatment response.",

      "title": "Exercise for depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common clinical condition, affecting over 120 million people worldwide. People experience pervasive, sustained feelings of sadness and hopelessness, persistent loss of interest, enjoyment and motivation as well as disruptions in areas such as appetite, sleep, concentration and energy levels. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and produces a greater decrement in health than chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and angina. Conventional treatments centre largely on pharmacological and psychological strategies, either on their own or in combination; but these are not acceptable to everyone. Antidepressant treatment can be complicated by side effects and drug interactions, and psychological therapies require motivation from the participant. Patients may also reject both antidepressants and psychological therapy because of perceived stigma. For several decades, exercise has been investigated as an alternative therapy for depression and several mechanisms have been proposed for its potential efficacy. It may provide distraction from negative thoughts or enhance a sense of self-efficacy through mastering a new skill. Social contact through exercise may also have a positive impact on mood and, from a more biological perspective, changes to circulating monoamines or endorphins, or reductions in the stress hormone cortisol, may also play a role. This review set out to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized trials of the effect of exercise in people with depression. We included studies comparing exercise with no treatment, as well as those that compared exercise with psychological or antidepressant approaches. The current version updates the earlier Cochrane Review, first published in 2009. We included trials of adults with a diagnosis of depression as defined by the original researchers. In assessing the intervention, we were guided by the American College of Sports Medicine definition of exercise as \"planned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness\". We identified 39 trials, recruiting approximately 2300 participants, drawn from a variety of sources including inpatient and outpatient populations, as well as from the general public by media advertising. A diagnosis of depression was made either by structured diagnostic interview or through the use of rating scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The included trials varied widely with respect to the type of exercise, as well as its duration and frequency or the overall \"dose\" of exercise. Of the 39 trials, 32 provided aerobic exercise such as running, cycling, walking or dance; with 4 providing muscle-strengthening resistance training. Other trials provided a combination of aerobic and resistance training. There were further differences with respect to whether exercise was conducted alone or in groups, indoors or outdoors, supervised or unsupervised. Our main finding was that when compared to a control intervention, there was a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as when we analysed the six trials that were considered high quality, the effect size was clinically small and not statistically significant. A series of subgroup analyses suggested that a larger number of exercise sessions may have a greater clinical effect on mood and that resistance training or a mixture of aerobic and resistance training may be more efficacious than aerobic training alone. When exercise was compared with antidepressant medication, there was no statistical difference between the two interventions. Likewise for psychological therapy, our findings revealed no difference between this and an exercise intervention. The nature and extent to which exercise may have an effect on mood remains uncertain. Most included trials were small and many had methodological weaknesses. One inherent difficulty in these studies is that it is not possible to blind participants allocated to exercise. A further potential source of bias is that outcome measures for depression are often gathered from self-rated scales of depression, completed by the participants themselves before and after the intervention. The evidence in this review would be strengthened by further large-scale, high-quality studies, where all participants are diagnosed with depression through structured clinical interview and receive exercise as a stand-alone intervention. Further research comparing exercise with either anti depressant medication or psychological therapies, would also help resolve uncertainties about the choice between these options.",

      "abstract": "While opioid dependence has more treatment agents available than other abused drugs, none are curative. They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.",

Less common and unpredictable reactions are blood dyscrasias, cardiotoxicity, sudden death, and the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

Patients should undergo comprehensive health checks before an antipsychotic is prescribed, and drug therapy should be individualized to take account of any preexisting symptoms. Side effects and the wider implications of drug treatment, such as effects on occupational and social functioning, should be discussed with the patient before initiating therapy. Patients should be regularly monitored for side effects during treatment and switched to alternative therapy if side effects are serious and/or persistent.",

      "abstract": "A task force of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) recently published a tremor classification scheme that is based on the nosologic principle of two primary axes for classifying an illness: clinical manifestations (Axis 1) and etiology (Axis 2). An Axis 1 clinical syndrome is a recurring group of clinical symptoms, signs (physical findings) and possibly laboratory results that suggest the presence of at least one underlying Axis 2 etiology. Syndromes must be defined and used consistently to be of value in finding specific etiologies and effective treatments. The MDS task force concluded that essential tremor is a common neurological syndrome that has never been defined consistently by clinicians and researchers. The MDS task force defined essential tremor as a syndrome of bilateral upper limb action tremor of at least 3 years duration, with or without tremor in other locations (e.g., head, voice, or lower limbs), in the absence of other neurological signs (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, myoclonus, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment). Deviations from this definition should not be labeled as essential tremor. Patients with additional questionably-abnormal signs or with signs of uncertain relevance to tremor are classified as essential tremor plus. The MDS classification scheme encourages a thorough unbiased phenotyping of patients with tremor, with no assumptions of etiology, pathology, pathophysiology or relationship to other neurological disorders. The etiologies, pathology and clinical course of essential tremor are too heterogeneous for this syndrome to be viewed as a disease or a family of diseases.",

Οι ασθενείς που είναι κλινικά ευπαθείς δυσκολεύονται να διαχειριστούν στρεσογόνους παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με οργανικά, ψυχολογικά ή κοινωνικο-οικονομικά αίτια με αποτέλεσμα να επηρεάζεται η καθημερινότητά τους και να μην μπορούν να φέρουν εις πέρας δραστηριότητες ρουτίνας. Επιπρόσθετα, η σαρκοπενία σχετίζεται με αυξημένο κίνδυνο αρνητικών επιπτώσεων για την υγεία, όπως η απώλεια της αυτονομίας, λειτουργική ανικανότητα, συχνές πτώσεις, κακή ποιότητα ζωής, ιδρυματοποίηση, πολλαπλές και μακρες νοσηλείες και αυξημένη θνητότητα. Παράγοντες όπως η εθνικότητα, το χαμηλό εισόδημα, η κοινωνική απομόνωση, χρόνιες παθήσεις και υποκείμενα νοσήματα, καθώς επίσης και περιβαλλοντικοί παράγοντες αποτελούν το υπόβαθρο για την εκδήλωση και πρόοδο των κλινικών αυτών συνδρόμων. Με την πάροδο της ηλικίας αυξάνει και η επίπτωσή τους. Οι ασθενείς που πάσχουν από κίρρωση του ήπατος συχνά χαρακτηρίζονται ως ευπάθεις ή και σαρκοπενικοί, με αποτέλεσμα να επηρεάζεται αρνητικά η πρόγνωση της νόσου και κατά συνέπεια να αυξάνονται τα ποσοστά νοσηρότητας και θνητότητας. Μελέτες που να συσχετίζουν την κίρρωση με την ευπάθεια και σαρκοπενία μπορεί να βοηθήσουν στην έγκαιρη διάγνωση, πρόληψη και πιθανώς βελτίωση αυτών των κλινικών συνδρόμων. Στόχος της μελέτης αυτής είναι να διαγνωσθεί η ευπάθεια και η σαρκοπενία αντίστοιχα στους κιρρωτικούς ασθενείς και να μελετηθούν βιοδείκτες που πιθανά συσχετίζονται με τις παραπάνω συνθήκες. Ως αποτέλεσμα οι κλινικοί γιατροί θα μπορούν να αντιληφθούν σε πρώιμα στάδια τα προαναφερθέντα κλινικά σύνδρομα, σε κιρρωτικούς ασθενείς με ή χωρίς ρήξη της αντιρρόπησης.",

      "abstract": "sevoflurane. Agitation is a state of mild restlessness and mental distress. Agitation can arise from any number of sources, including pain, physiological compromise, or anxiety [2]. Sikich and Lerman [3] defined emergence delirium as “a disturbance in a child’s awareness of and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations, including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in the immediate postanesthesia period.” Emergence agitation and emergence delirium have been used interchangeably in most of the literature. Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it. The reported prevalence of emergence agitation/delirium varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 10% to 80% [5,6], depending on the definition and criteria of emergence agitation/delirium.

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

      "abstract": "Abstract The first part of this two-part series discusses psychological influences in delayed and failed recovery and resulting unnecessary work disability; the second part discusses theoretical and practical aspects of the issue, including evaluation and treatment. Delayed and failed recovery and unnecessary disability (DFRUD) refers to a lag in, or lack of, expected recovery from a medical condition and/or unnecessary resultant disability. Causation is complex, and we are not doing well at managing this group of workers using a biomedical model. The traditional biomedical model posits that disease or injury produces symptoms and signs that cause impairment and result in disability. This approach too strictly separates mental phenomena and bodily function (Cartesian dualism) and leads to scientific reductionism when actually six domains are active in worker disability: medical, personal, psychological, sociocultural, systematic (including compensation and insurance), and workplace elements. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) should be understood as a disturbance of normal neurological and/or psychological processes underlying symptom production, perception, and experience and cannot be better explained by another physical or psychiatric illness. Within this system of evaluation, administrative and medical iatrogenicity are associated with unnecessary medical care and poor outcomes for individuals. In addition to determining industrial causality and apportionment, if evaluators accept some psychological factors, MUPS, and central sensitization, they must explain to what extent these are compensable. Part two of this article will discuss theoretical and practical approaches, including specific evaluation and treatment methods.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated. The authors report no financial or other relationship relevant to the subject of this article.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

      "title": "Parkinson's disease symptoms: The patient's perspective",
      "abstract": "Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) will typically experience a range of motor and nonmotor symptoms during the course of their illness, each of which will affect a particular individual to varying degrees. However, patients' perceptions of troublesome symptoms often differ from the clinician's view, and these discrepancies can hamper effective management of PD. In this study, we have assessed 265 consecutive PD patients by asking them to rank their three most troublesome symptoms in the last 6 months, so to gain further insight from the impact of illness on patients' quality of life. Patients were divided into early (<6 years) and late PD groups (>/=6 years) from symptom onset. The division at 6 years was based on the mean time from symptom onset to the development of motor complications. In the early PD group, the 5 most prevalent complaints (ranked in descending order) are slowness, tremor, stiffness, pain, and loss of smell and/or taste. In the advanced PD group, fluctuating response to their medication (most common: wearing-off phenomenon followed by dyskinesia), mood changes, drooling, sleep problems (most common: middle and late night insomnia followed by daytime sleepiness), and tremor were the top 5. Our findings provide further evidence for the diversity of experience in PD and suggest that as the disease advances the most troublesome issues that patients perceive are the lack of response to medication and the nonmotor aspects of the disease, highlighting the importance of assessment and patient-centered management in the follow-up of these patients.",

      "title": "Clozapine and Constipation: A Review of Clinical Considerations and Treatment Options",
      "abstract": "Psychosis, a break in reality which is manifested as hallucinations, delusions or the disruption in thought process, is the hallmark of schizophrenia. Despite novel pharmacotherapy advancements of antipsychotic medications that have resulted in some patients having the ability to return to social settings and thereby decreasing psychotic symptoms and reducing hospital admissions, there is still a sub-population of patients who remain symptomatic. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is defined as failure of treatment with at least two different antipsychotics with the proper length of treatment and titration. Clozapine has been heralded as a drug to resolve the puzzle of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine has one side effect that is well known, being the development of agranulocytosis. However, there is another side effect that can limit clozapine’s use and can also be life-threatening. Recently, at the end of January 2020, the FDA issued a communications statement which “[strengthened] an existing warning that constipation caused by the schizophrenia medicine clozapine can, uncommonly, progress to serious bowel complications.” After identifying ten cases of constipation from between 2006 to 2016 that progressed to hospitalization, surgery, and even death, the FDA focused their attention on this often overlooked, common side effect, especially when considering the strong anticholinergic effects of clozapine. Although patients are screened by their physicians for agranulocytosis by weekly lab monitoring, constipation is also a complication that needs to be identified and treated. Much like opioid-induced constipation, constipation can also be reduced with the use of laxatives and reduction in the co-prescribing of anticholinergic therapies with clozapine.",

      "title": "The Potential Role of Iatrogenic Comorbidity in the Interaction between Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy in Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the setting of anxiety disorders is often viewed as a potential source of augmentation of clinical effects, with little attention paid to the potential occurrence of negative events. In most of the studies, however, if benefits ensued, they were modest and likely to fade. Further, 4 high-quality and well-designed individual studies suggest that the addition of a benzodiazepine or an antidepressant to cognitive behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders could be detrimental compared to placebo at follow-up. The aim of this review was to outline a novel hypothesis, which needs to be adequately tested but may shed some new light on this interaction. Any type of psychotropic drug treatment, particularly after long-term use, may increase the risk of experiencing additional psychopathological problems that do not necessarily subside with discontinuation of the drug or of modifying responsiveness to subsequent treatments. The changes are persistent and not limited to a short phase, such as in the case of withdrawal reactions, and cannot be subsumed under the generic rubrics of adverse events or side effects. The term ‘iatrogenic comorbidity' refers to unfavorable modifications in the course, characteristics, and responsiveness of an illness that may be related to treatments that were administered previously. The likelihood of iatrogenic comorbidity needs to be considered in clinical practice: The concurrent use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may yield advantages in the short term, but its costs at some later point in time may largely outweigh such benefits.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "title": "Vulnerabilidad cognitiva a la hipocondría: intrusiones, valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales/ cognitive vulnerability to hypochondriasis: intrusions, appraisals and dysfunctional beliefs",
      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis is a disorder characterized by the fear or belief of suffering from a serious illness based on the negative interpretation of bodily signs and symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, confirmation by a physician that the patient does not have a medical condition does not result in safe and lasting reassurance. Generally, people with hypochondriasis may experience a reduction in anxiety after a visit to the doctor, but this reduction lasts only hours or days. When another symptom occurs, anxiety reappears, and the cycle of hypochondriacal worry resumes. In addition, hypochondriasis can manifest itself in different ways. Some patients have numerous intrusive thoughts and sensations during the day that lead them to consult family, friends, the Internet, or different medical specialists to make sure they are not seriously ill or to identify the course of the disease. Other patients, on the other hand, avoid health care providers and any reference to the disease in their daily lives, so that the anxiety they seek to suppress does not increase. Hypochondriasis has also been conceptualized in cognitive models as an extreme form of health anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral proposals of hypochondriasis and health anxiety and recent research on this disorder have suggested different cognitive variables as possible risk factors for the development and maintenance of the problem. They include intrusive thoughts about possible health hazards (illness-ITs), the dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs associated with these thoughts, and dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness. Although these variables have been pointed out in the literature as vulnerability factors for hypochondriasis and health anxiety, there are hardly any studies analyzing their role in the genesis and development of the disorder, and the results obtained are not entirely conclusive either. The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the role played by these variables in hypochondriasis and health anxiety. The preliminary study provided a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate health anxiety in Spanish-speaking adults, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Study 1 explored the presence and characteristics of illness-ITs in the general population, and through this study, a new self-report instrument has been provided, the Illness Intrusive Thoughts Inventory (INPIE), to evaluate illness-ITs. Study 2 examined differences between patients with hypochondriasis and community participants in the recurrence of illness-ITs and the consequences of experiencing them. Studies 2 and 3 also evaluated the role of dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs about illness-ITs. Study 4 analyzed the importance of the family context in the adoption of dysfunctional beliefs about health/illness and thoughts. The results show that (1) the SHAI is an appropriate self-report instrument to measure health anxiety in the Spanish-speaking adult population; (2) the INPIE is an adequate self-report questionnaire to assess the frequency of illness-ITs, as well as the appraisals and control strategies associated with these thoughts; (3) illness-ITs are a universal and dimensional phenomenon; (4) dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs about illness-ITs play a significant role in the escalation from normal intrusive cognitions and their associated consequences to clinical health anxiety-related symptoms; and (5) dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness and thoughts can be acquired within the family. These results have substantial clinical implications because understanding the functioning and characteristics of some of the key elements in the genesis and development of hypochondriasis and health anxiety may improve and update the treatment protocols for these patients. La hipocondria es un trastorno caracterizado por el miedo o la creencia de padecer una enfermedad grave a partir de la interpretacion negativa de los signos y sintomas corporales. La confirmacion por parte de un medico, despues de una evaluacion exhaustiva, de que el paciente no padece una enfermedad medica, no tiene como resultado una tranquilizacion segura y duradera. Por lo general, las personas que presentan hipocondria pueden experimentar una reduccion de la ansiedad despues de visitar al medico, pero esta reduccion dura solo horas o dias. Cuando se presenta otro sintoma, la ansiedad reaparece y el ciclo de preocupacion hipocondriaca se reanuda. Ademas, la hipocondria se puede manifestar de diferentes maneras. Algunos pacientes tienen numerosos pensamientos intrusos y sensaciones durante el dia que los llevan a consultar con la familia, amigos, internet o diferentes especialistas medicos para asegurarse de que no estan gravemente enfermos o para identificar el curso de la enfermedad. Y, otros pacientes, por el contrario, evitan a los proveedores de servicios de salud y cualquier referencia a la enfermedad en su vida diaria, para que no aumente la ansiedad que buscan reprimir. La hipocondria se ha conceptualizado tambien, desde los modelos cognitivos, como la forma mas extrema de ansiedad por la salud. Las propuestas cognitivo-conductuales de la hipocondria y las investigaciones recientes en torno a este trastorno han sugerido diferentes variables cognitivas como posibles factores de riesgo para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del problema. Entre ellos, destacan: los pensamientos intrusos sobre los posibles peligros para la salud (PIEs), las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a estos pensamientos, y los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad. Aunque todas estas variables se han senalado, en la literatura cientifica, como factores de vulnerabilidad hacia la hipocondria, no existen apenas estudios en los que se analice su papel en la genesis y evolucion del trastorno, y los resultados obtenidos tampoco son del todo concluyentes. Por todo ello, la presente Tesis tiene como finalidad clarificar el rol que juegan los pensamientos intrusos, las valoraciones/interpretaciones y las creencias disfuncionales (sobre los pensamientos y sobre la salud/enfermedad) en la hipocondria y la ansiedad por la salud. El estudio preliminar proporciono un instrumento fiable y valido para evaluar la ansiedad por la salud en adultos de habla hispana, el Inventario Breve de Ansiedad por la Salud (SHAI). El Estudio 1 exploro la presencia y caracteristicas de los PIEs en la poblacion general, y a traves de este estudio se ha proporcionado un nuevo instrumento de autoinforme, el Inventario de Pensamientos Intrusos sobre la Enfermedad (INPIE), para evaluar los PIEs. El estudio 2 examino las diferencias entre los pacientes con hipocondria y los participantes de la comunidad en la recurrencia con la que se experimentaban PIEs y las consecuencias derivadas de su experimentacion. Los estudios 2 y 3 tambien evaluaron el papel de las valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs. El estudio 4 analizo la importancia del contexto familiar en la adopcion de supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos. Los resultados muestran que (1) el SHAI es un instrumento de autoinforme apropiado para medir la ansiedad por la salud en la poblacion adulta de habla hispana; (2) el INPIE es un cuestionario de autoinforme adecuado para evaluar la frecuencia de los PIEs, asi como las valoraciones y estrategias de control asociadas a estos pensamientos; (3) los PIEs son un fenomeno universal y dimensional; (4) las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs juegan un papel significativo en la escalada de los pensamientos intrusos normales y sus consecuencias funcionales a los sintomas clinicos relacionados con la ansiedad por la salud, y (5) los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos pueden adquirirse en el seno familiar. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones clinicas sustanciales, ya que la comprension del funcionamiento y las caracteristicas de algunos de los elementos clave para la genesis y el desarrollo de la hipocondria y la ansiedad para la salud puede mejorar y actualizar los protocolos de tratamiento para estos pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Addiction to alcohol or any other psychoactive substance can run parallel with other diseases or mental disorders. One can then observe co-occurrence and mutual interaction of dysfunctions typical of addiction and of other mental disorders that accompany addiction. That is why, clinical pictures of such states (double diagnosis) are usually less unique, have an unusual course and cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty. The problem of forensic psychiatric opinion and treatment of people with a double diagnosis is another aspect of these difficulties. It is caused by the fact that forensic psychiatric assessment of the mental state of such people requires taking into consideration a very complex clinical and legal situation triggered by the interference of various ethiopathogenetic and clinical disorders. It leads to the need for complex evaluation and reference to sanity or other signs of functioning within the current law should result, first of all, from the analyses directly pertaining to the influence of the diagnosed disorders on the state of patients with double diagnosis. The forensic psychiatric aspect of disorders connected with double diagnosis is particularly significant as there is a relatively high risk of behaviours posing a threat to public order in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Connected Separateness or Separate Connection:Envisioning Body with Mind Nancy Kennedy, DrPH (bio) Consumers, including those who are poor and underserved, do not experience mental and physical health separately, although the dualism of the health care systems for primary care and mental health suggests that they do. Few consumers seeking health care services, whatever their socioeconomic circumstances, do so because they themselves recognize that they suffer from a mental disorder, a substance use disorder or even one of the ubiquitous problems of living that increase stress, anxiety and other negative feelings that give rise to deleterious behaviors (such as increased drug use, overeating, excessive shopping, inappropriate acts of violence). In contrast, lay people quite commonly self-diagnose and seek out health care services, motivated by physical discomfort or concerns about illness or by physical situations such as pregnancy; accidents and injuries; sexually transmitted diseases; headaches, stomach aches, and other assorted pains; and complications from diabetes, liver and kidney disease and hypertension. Approximately 37 million Americans 15 years old or older, or 15% of the population, have some sort of physical, mental, or emotional disability, making this one of the largest minorities in the country.1 (In fact 15% is probably lower than the actual percentage but it is the confirmable number given the paucity of the data and difficulties associated with epidemiological research.) An overwhelming 70% of the total U.S. population at some point in their lives will endure a condition lasting at least 6 months that interferes with activities of daily living, qualifying them as disabled.2 Unfortunately, our current health care system, in both its organization and financing, legitimizes the medicalization of these conditions, relegating problems associated with mental health to a lesser status. Meanwhile, the current U.S. health care system, having shifted its focus from infectious disease to chronic disease and behavioral disorders, engages in an unending discussion of how to integrate primary care and mental health, without emerging with significant changes to the medical model. [End Page 501] Providers, policymakers, and administrators, as well as consumers, must realize that the stigma associated with mental disorders, emotional problems, and even the normal sequellae to bereavement, physical relocation, marriage, divorce or separation, financial difficulties, weather-related disasters, and job loss is an impediment to positive outcomes including resiliency and wellness, self-care, and disease management for chronic conditions. In studies, conferences, and articles, health professionals implore the primary care and mental health systems to integrate rather than remaining separate. Federal efforts to promote these connections can be traced at least as far back as 1967, when community and migrant health centers were founded and to 1973, when federally qualified health maintenance organizations were first formed.3 Despite these efforts and the existence of some excellent models and programs where attention to body with mind is paramount, requests for integration continue to pour out, as is evident in the final report of President Bush's 2003 Commission on Mental Health.4 Significantly, the authors of that report note, \"Primary care providers may lack the necessary time, training, or resources to provide appropriate treatment for mental health problems. (page 21)\"4 Experts and practitioners in behavioral medicine and public health typically welcome the opportunity to integrate psychosocial with biomedical approaches to health and illness. Such opportunities arise during primary prevention encounters and the attendant attempts to change factors influencing health or well being, especially lifestyle and attitudes, beliefs, and moods that influence adaptation to stressors or illness. However, with the exception of behavioral medicine, a discipline whose intervention techniques ultimately are based on learning theory,5 few physicians or other primary care providers are interested in or profess to have the time to impart strategies to enhance mental health, prevent mental disorders or teach disease management techniques to treat mind with body. Health care is evolutionary. The emergence of managed care shifted the spotlight to primary care. In the early 1990s, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) appointed an expert Committee to assess the opportunities and challenges for primary care.6 One central characteristic of primary care is noted in the IOM report: \"Primary care does not consider mental health separately from physical health.

However, mental health and addiction treatment systems often are separated. This situation may result in patients' being treated at one location for addiction and at another for mental disorders.

The major situations in Psychiatry and Addiction include: Agitation, suicidal and auto-aggressive behavior, convulsive seizures and status epilepticus; Nonalcoholic (somatogenic) delirium; amential syndrome, Delirium tremens (complicated and uncomplicated), acute alcoholic encephalopathy Gayet-Wernicke; Syndromes Off consciousness Refusal to eat due to mental disorders, severe (deep) drunkenness; overdose of opiates or opioids; Main types of withdrawal syndromes; Panic attacks and vegetative crises; poisoning with psychotropic drugs, acute complications in the application of psychotropic drugs. In psychiatric practice conditions are not determined by the intensity of the patient experience, and psycho-motor manifestations of the disease or expected actions and behavior of the patient. Emergency assistance for mental illness, along with drug treatment includes special activities for the care, supervision and oversight. It should be emphasized that the services have not only acute but also in chronic psychotic disorders occurring involving dangerous actions of patients. Of all the categories of emergencies in psychiatry are three main, related to: • suicide attempt or threat; • Unmanaged agitated;• physical violence or its threat. The provision of care for mentally ill need to establish an accurate diagnosis of acute symptoms and underlying mental illness that caused the syndrome, and be sure to monitor the behavior of the patient. If the primary diagnosis of mental illness is not possible, to exclude the organic etiology of acute agitation or other mental disorders, as high doses of haloperidol, chlorpromazine and other neuroleptics inside (as in relieving mania or schizophrenia) can lead to death. The most pressing problem of differential diagnosis in mental is the establishment of an organic or inorganic nature of acute mental syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a therapeutic condition, a chronic relapsing disease. As in other domains of experimental medicine, appropriate experimental investigations are needed in order to better understand the disease. People with an addiction do not have control over what they are doing, taking or using. Their addiction may reach a point at which it is harmful. Addictions do not only include physical things we consume, such as drugs or alcohol, but may include virtually anything, such abstract things as gambling to seemingly harmless products, such as chocolate - in other words, addiction may refer to a substance dependence (e.g. drug addiction) or behavioural addiction (e.g. gambling addiction).However, to understand the diverse facets of drug effects and of the underlying pathophysiology it is necessary to keep in mind the complexity of the psychopathological processes. The main symptoms that characterize addiction correspond to expressions of dysfunctions within specific circuits and regions. Pathways to addiction are numerous and comorbidity and in the real world poly-drug use are common.The study show that so many molecules and formulations are present in the market that used as drug addiction like codein phasphte syrup, alprazolam tablet, pentazocine injection, combination of gandapuro tel and turpine tel ointment, lorazepam tablet, pheniramine maleate, nitrazepam tablet.",

Due to their potential as drugs of abuse, recreational use of most of these substances is illegal since 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In recent years, new psychoactive substances have emerged mainly as synthetic cathinones with new molecules frequently complementing the list. Psychostimulant related movement disorders are a known entity often seen in emergency rooms around the world.These admissions are becoming more frequent as are fatalities associated with drug abuse. Still the legal constraints of the novel synthetic molecules are bypassed. At the same time, chronic and permanent movement disorders are much less frequently encountered.These disorders frequently manifest as a combination of movement disorders. The more common symptoms include agitation, tremor, hyperkinetic and stereotypical movements, cognitive impairment, and also hyperthermia and cardiovascular dysfunction.The pathophysiological mechanisms behind the clinical manifestations have been researched for decades.The common denominator is the monoaminergic signaling. Dopamine has received the most attention but further research has demonstrated involvement of other pathways. Common mechanisms linking psychostimulant use and several movement disorders exist.",

Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence.

      "abstract": "Nearly every category of psychotropic drug has been investigated in an attempt to find a pharmacologic treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This study reviews published trials from the English literature in which tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, and other agents were employed for treatment of OCD. Weaknesses in the current methodology including diagnosis, measurement of severity and criteria for improvement have contributed to invalid conclusions about drug treatment and efficacy. It appears that OCD is an etiologically heterogeneous disorder with a complex differential diagnosis. For the clinician, a major conclusion drawn from this review is that no agent emerges as a drug of choice. Although clorimipramine, the most actively investigated agent, shows some promise, it has not been conclusively demonstrated that other, more readily available heterocyclic agents are less effective. Furthermore, when other disorders co-exist, such as panic disorder, alternative agents may prove as effective.",

On estime ainsi qu’entre un et deux tiers des épisodes dépressifs majeurs ne répondront pas à un premier antidépresseur prescrit. Mais avant de parler d’inefficacité d’un traitement, il est important d’évaluer certains aspects susceptibles d’entraver l’efficacité de ce dernier. Un examen clinique complet ainsi que certains examens complémentaires (TSH par exemple) seront dans un premier temps nécessaires afin de d’éliminer une pathologie organique responsable d’une symptomatologie dépressive, qui pourra régresser une fois cette pathologie traitée. Une cause iatrogène médicamenteuse devra aussi être éliminée, ainsi qu’une cause toxique (abus de substances). L’entretien clinique nous permettra ensuite de confirmer le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif majeur et de son évolution sous traitement, ainsi que d’éliminer des diagnostics psychiatriques différentiels (un trouble bipolaire par exemple) ou certaines comorbidités psychiatriques, tels qu’un trouble de la personnalité. Après s’être assuré que la posologie prescrite et la durée de traitement antidépresseur sont adéquates, l’un des critères fondamentaux à évaluer est l’observance du traitement prescrit. Il est de plus indispensable d’évaluer le contexte de vie et les facteurs de stress parfois responsables d’une chronicisation de la symptomatologie dépressive. Il est donc nécessaire de prendre le temps d’évaluer globalement la situation pour s’assurer que le traitement antidépresseur mis en place est réellement inefficace, avant de passer à une autre stratégie thérapeutique.",

Benzodiazepines are still among the most commonly used classes of medications, and they differ in their pharmacodynamic properties. They have varied uses as monotherapy or as adjunctive medication because of their efficacy in the treatment of conditions involving a dysfunction of the GABAergic system or where neuronal inhibition is required. In multiple therapy, benzodiazepines augment the efficacy of other drugs such as lithium in mania, antipsychotics in psychotic agitation and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence and tolerance in most patients; predisposed individuals are at greater risk. Short- and intermediate-beta half-life compounds carry a greater risk of rebound and withdrawal reactions, and drug dependence than long acting agents. Adverse effects include sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, memory loss, potentiation of other central nervous system depressants and treatment-emergent depression. Drug potency and beta elimination half-life are reviewed and compared as pharmacokinetic variables.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibiity seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleo-vestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

It may follow any sort of illness; it may exist as an underlying cause of headache, of other pains or aches, and of definite dysfunctions of different organ systems. It is usually recognized by the sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and loss of general interest that accompanies it, but undoubtedly many people are given needless operations and many patients refuse to get well because the symptoms rather than the underlying depression are treated. The depression is a reaction of the total being and as such has its physiological and psychological aspects. In this paper, the disorder will be approached as a personality problem and from the psychiatrist's point of view with the idea of making it possible for the general",

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

Despite intensive treatment research, the role of pharmacotherapy in the illness remains uncertain.An updated review is given of pharmacotherapy in CFS, with a focus on non-antidepressant, controlled drug trials performed between 1988 and August 2009.Antiviral, immunological and antibiotic therapies, although sometimes associated with symptom amelioration, can be more harmful than beneficial in CFS. Stimulants seem to benefit some CFS patients but their long-term effects is uncertain. Although antidepressants are not curative for the illness, they might be useful for some symptomatic aspects and co-morbid anxiety and depression. There is little or no evidence that CFS patients benefit from other pharmacological agents (e.g., steroids) or from dietary supplements and complementary medicine products. Future research into treatment should take specific subgroups into account and should target immunological aspects of the illness as well as the complex relationships between CFS, stress and depression.Pharmacotherapy can currently not be considered first-line treatment in CFS and should always be used in a context of self-management and rehabilitation.",

Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

Are you disinterested?\" in suspected cases. • There is a need for developing Indian consensus to identify co-morbid depression, to decide when to start an antidepressant drug, in what dosage and duration with special focus on the when to refer to a psychiatrist.

Therefore, it is not surprising for patients with SCI to develop mental health problems, such as depression and/or anxiety. Depressive symptoms include agitation, restlessness, fatigue, changes in appetite, helplessness, loss of interest as well as problems in sleeping. The presence of depression has been connected with extended length of hospitalization and development of secondary medical complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy. The purpose of this review is to investigate the existing literature to identify the effect of depression on hospitalization and rehabilitation in patients with SCI. From the 31 studies included in this paper, it is obvious that SCI patients with depression have longer periods of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation as well as worse functional outcomes. Moreover, it was shown that SCI individuals with depressive symptoms frequently develop other secondary medical complications which subsequently affect the length of stay and the rehabilitation outcomes. Acknowledging these facts can improve diagnosis and intervention, which may also improve the patient’s recovery outcome.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain and Depression: Understanding 2 Culprits in Common: Does a Shared Pathophysiology Hold the Key to Managing These Conditions When They Coexist?",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Any discussion of the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic encounters an obstacle immediately: Neither has a singular pathophysiology. Furthermore, MDD and, to a significant extent, chronic are defined more by their symptoms than by a presumed etiology and pathogenesis. Why does this matter to a busy clinician? Explicitly or implicitly, we often align our treatment approaches with what we assume is the underlying pathophysiology of the conditions we are addressing. An overview of shared pathophysiology of chronic conditions and MDD therefore can be useful in practice. What is chronic pain? Defined as pain that persists past the healing phase following an injury, (1) chronic often is subdivided into 4 types (2,3): * nociceptive (caused by a lesion or potential tissue damage) * inflammatory * neuropathic (spontaneous or hypersensitivity to related to neurologic illness or injury) * functional (hypersensitivity to due to abnormal central processing of a normal input). Although fibromyalgia often is categorized as a dysfunctional syndrome, persons who suffer from it, much like those who suffer neuropathic pain, commonly report hyperalgesia (augmented sensitivity to painful stimuli), allodynia (abnormal response to non-noxious stimuli), and paresthesias. These shared clinical features of fibromyalgia and neuropathic are consistent with central sensitization, which suggests overlapping pathophysiology. (4) Comorbidity between depression and is common. A 30% to 60% co-occurrence rate of MDD and chronic has been reported. (5) Some subtypes of chronic pain, such as fibromyalgia, are so commonly comorbid with psychiatric conditions that they have spawned a scientific debate as to whether the conditions are most parsimoniously considered (1) separate illnesses with high comorbidity or (2) different symptomatic manifestations of a single underlying condition. (6) Moreover, cumulative evidence suggests that chronic and depression do not just co-occur; each one facilitates development of the other, such that chronic is a strong predictor of subsequent onset of MDD, and vice versa. When and depression are comorbid, they also tend to make treatment of each condition more difficult. For example, presents (1) a major obstacle to achieving remission when treating depression (7,8) and (2) significant risk of relapse. (9) A 3-year longitudinal study showed that painful symptoms substantially reduced the chance of recovery in a group of older depressed patients (n = 327). A substantially greater percentage of patients with MDD alone attained recovery (47%), compared with only 9% in whom MDD and painful symptoms were comorbid. (10) Furthermore, a higher level of can delay remission when treating MDD, (11) thus reducing the likelihood of an optimal outcome. (12) Understanding shared processes. Recent developments in neuroscience and psychoimmunology point to the fact that comorbid and depression might be driven by overlapping pathophysiological processes in the brain and body. In the 2 parts of this article, we (1) review scientific understanding of these shared processes and (2) demonstrate how recent advances in the epidemiology, phenomenology, and etiology of chronic and MDD provide important clues for more effective diagnosis (Part 1) and treatment (Part 2, March 2016)--and, therefore, better outcomes. Our focus is primarily on the relationship between MDD and the best-studied comorbid chronic conditions: fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, chronic back pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. The societal burden of chronic conditions is enormous A recent epidemiological study (13) projected that as many as 100 million people in the United States--30.7% of the population--suffer some form of chronic pain, including arthritis and joint pain. …",

      "abstract": "Medication treatment can only 'level the playing field'.Psychosocial treatment, group therapy, and individual counselling do the actual treatment to prevent relapse\" (James Halikas, 1993).Psychosocial treatment for substance use disorders is a broad \"umbrella\" term that brings under its folds a diverse array of non-pharmacological interventions for effective and global management of drug abuse.The common thread underlying these interventions is that they do not involve prescribing medicines in any form.This does not mean, however, that psychosocial treatment has any conflict with pharmacological treatment.Quite on the contrary, it has been documented that each modality of treatment helps the other.Specifically, psychosocial interventions can enhance pharmacological treatment efficacy by increasing medication compliance, retention in treatment, and acquisition of skills that reinforce the effects of medications.Other than this short-term goal of strengthening pharmacological efficacy, psychosocial treatment serves the even more important long-term goal of abstinence maintenance.Getting detoxified from an abused drug is relatively much easier than staying away from the drug in the long run, as evidenced by the world-wide high rate of relapse of treated drug addicts.Psychosocial treatment aims to overcome, or approximate, this difficult challenge.Staying drug free for a long period of time may be practically impossible for a substance abuser living a particular life style, often in a drug-using \"sub-culture\", where the primary preoccupation's and themes of living revolve around drugs.Thus, long-term abstinence also necessarily implies, ultimately, a change of life style and adoption of a more productive life style.Accordingly, it follows that these are also the ultimate goals of psychosocial treatment for substance use disorders.Treatment for specific drugs can differ depending on the characteristics of the patient, and the problems associated with an individual's drug addiction.The main goals of psychosocial treatments are-to enhance efficacy of pharmacotherapy, to achieve a sustained drug free status, a change of life style, and have an improved quality of life.In keeping with these goals, the short-term goals are-increasing medication compliance, increasing retention in treatment, and acquisition of skills that reinforce the effects of medication.The long-term goals are-maintenance of abstinence, a change of life style, and corresponding adoption of a productive life style.",

      "title": "THE EVIL SEQUELAE OF COMPLETE BED REST",
      "abstract": "It is rarely possible to ascribe to bed rest alone the disorders which become manifest in patients confined to bed during the treatment of disease or injury. Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

      "title": "The treatment of the first seizure: The risks",
      "abstract": "The risks associated with prescribing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in a person who had a single unprovoked seizure fall into three domains: (1) the risk that treatment will not be effective in preventing seizure relapse, and the consequences thereof; (2) the risks of a person's life being affected by the psychological, social, and legal aspects of receiving treatment for a seizure disorder; (3) the health risks associated with intake of antiepileptic medication. This article with focus on the latter, addressing in particular concerns related to adverse drug effects. Serious or life-threatening adverse reactions are very uncommon in people started on AEDs, although some (e.g., teratogenic effects) can be a major concern in specific patient groups. Nonserious adverse reactions leading to withdrawal of treatment are relatively common, although in most cases these are reversible following removal of the offending agent. Adverse effects associated with prolonged treatment and not leading to drug withdrawal are an important concern, because such effects are often under-recognized and may affect significantly quality of life. Additional risks relate to the occurrence of drug-drug interactions. In all cases, risks can be minimized by careful selection of the AED to be used (with particular consideration of individual characteristics which contraindicate a specific AED, or predispose to specific adverse effects), gradual dose titration, choice of an appropriate target dose and, most important of all, careful monitoring of clinical response.",

      "title": "Use of Benzodiazepines and Hypnotic Medications in Psychiatry Older Adult Outpatients",
      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines have anxiolytic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxing properties, therefore, a widely prescribed treatment for anxiety and insomnia. They bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, which are responsible for most of the inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and these receptors are a major target of alcohol, barbiturates, muscle relaxants, and other medications with sedative effects, resulting in tolerance and dependence [1]. Benzodiazepines are categorized into short (15 to 30 minutes), intermediate (30 to 60 minutes), and long-acting agents (one hour or longer).\r\nBenzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for elderly patients living in the community and for those in hospitals and institutions. Prolonged use of benzodiazepines is particularly likely in old age for the treatment not only of insomnia and anxiety, but also of a wide range of nonspecific symptoms. Long term users are likely to have multiple concomitant physical and psychological health problems [2].\r\nBenzodiazepines produce dependence, reduce attention, memory, and motor ability. They can cause disinhibition or aggressive behavior, facilitate the appearance of delirium, and increase accident and mortality rates in people older than 60 [3].\r\nAccording to Maudsley guidelines, benzodiazepines use in elderly are poorly supported for their link to cognitive decline, increase risk of falls and hip fractures [4]. And, if indicated, short acting agents should be avoided. Long acting agents should be started in low doses and patients need to be followed and reassessed regularly. Zolpidem or melatonin are indicated for insomnia, clonazepam and diazepam for agitation and pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder [5].",

One of the reasons for this is that renal and liver functions are often impaired in elderly people. Dementia and delirium (an acute confused state) are known to be associated with drug toxicity. Anticholinergic medications are common causes of both acute and chronic cognitive impairment. Psychoactive drugs, antidepressants and anticonvulsants can cause dementia and delirium. In addition, non-psychoactive drugs such as histamine H2 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent), and cardiac medications, may cause acute or chronic cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis and withdrawal of the offending agent are essential for the prevention of drug-induced dementia and delirium.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

Are anxiety and depression entirely separate disorders which may co-exist in the same patient? Does anxiety give rise to the depression? Does depression give rise to the anxiety? Are anxiety and depression manifestations of a single underlying disorders, dysphoria? Therapeutic responsivity to specific drugs suggest: relief of anxiety may reveal an underlying depression; anxiety syndromes which fail to respond to anxiolytics may respond to antidepressants; short-term relief of depression may occur at times with anxiolytics. Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content. These may be related in turn to biogenic amines, beta-endorphins, diazepam receptors and possibly cocaine receptors.",

Treatment options are thus limited to symptomatic presentations and strive to relieve patients and caregivers of some of the behavioral and psychiatric sequelae that can severely impact the quality of life. In fact, neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia affect virtually all patients with dementia at some time during the disease course and are associated with earlier institutionalization, increased caregiving costs (both financial and otherwise), and worsened disease progression. Unfortunately, pharmacological measures acting on neurocircuitry that may be damaged in the brains of patients with dementia as well as attempts to utilize non-pharmacological, cognition-acting strategies in cognitively impaired patients with dementia may not be as effective as they are for younger, non-demented patients. It is also important to note that improvements in behavioral symptoms (e.g., depression) may be due not solely to a prescribed psychotropic agent but may also be a result of the extra social contact with the treatment team that medication warrants.",

In the first instance, intemperance may appear as a hurtful habit of the individual favouring the development of the spasmodic neurosis, or again, as a constitutional tendency entailed by parent on offspring with similar dreadful consequences. In the second instance, the moral perversion ordinarily wrought by their disease on the character and conduct of several epileptics, drives them to vicious indulgence in drinking, which aggravates and changes the original character of their fits. The majority of writers have not distinguished in estimating the relationship of intemperance to epilepsy, or insanity, the number of cases immediately ascribable to vice from those in which the uncontrollable passion, or craving for drink, is, as it also happens with masturbation, merely the sign of the outbreak of an inherited predisposition to insanity, or epilepsy, or of the early stages in the evolution of either of these maladies as consequence of accidental causes. Nor has the influence which traumatic injuries to the head, syphilis, or other derangements possibly coincident with the abuse of alcoholics, by themselves exert, been taken into proper account in calculating the part of the latter in the spread, on a wide and increasing scale, of mental and nervous affections. Although this discrimination is by no means always practicable, we may yet arrive at it by diligent inquiry and with a material change in the results, as evinced by the cases we pass on to analyse.",

In the first instance, intemperance may appear as a hurtful habit of the individual favouring the development of the spasmodic neurosis, or again, as a constitutional tendency entailed by parent on offspring with similar dreadful consequences. In the second instance, the moral perversion ordinarily wrought by their disease on the character and conduct of several epileptics, drives them to vicious indulgence in drinking, which aggravates and changes the original character of their fits. The majority of writers have not distinguished in estimating the relationship of intemperance to epilepsy, or insanity, the number of cases immediately ascribable to vice from those in which the uncontrollable passion, or craving for drink, is, as it also happens with masturbation, merely the sign of the outbreak of an inherited predisposition to insanity, or epilepsy, or of the early stages in the evolution of either of these maladies as consequence of accidental causes. Nor has the influence which traumatic injuries to the head, syphilis, or other derangements possibly coincident with the abuse of alcoholics, by themselves exert, been taken into proper account in calculating the part of the latter in the spread, on a wide and increasing scale, of mental and nervous affections. Although this discrimination is by no means always practicable, we may yet arrive at it by diligent inquiry and with a material change in the results, as evinced by the cases we pass on to analyse.",

      "title": "Behavior therapy of the sexual disorders",
      "abstract": "The behavioral therapies are bringing with them a new and interestingly effective approach to the treatment of sexual disorders based upon theories of learning. The two basic means used are: (1) reciprocal inhibition, as shown in J. Wolpe's (1958, 1961) systematic desensitization, wherein anxietyprovoking situations are overcome by the presentation of graduated fear stimuli in the presence of relaxation, and (2) aversive techniques, wherein pleasureful sexual sensations are converted to painful ones by chemical or electrical means. Systematic desensitization is what its name implies, a systematic or gradual desensitization to a noxious agent, through the use of the patient's visual imagination. It is most successful when employed against anxiety-provoking situations such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and frigidity. Also against the nonsexual aspects of homosexuality, exhibitionism, and other sexual deviations. The pleasureful aspects of the sexual deviations present another problem. It is no easy task to induce a person to give up what to him is exquisite pleasure. Consequently, aversive therapy is used to convert the pleasure into pain. More of this later. Systematic desensitization is preceded by the taking of a detailed history as in any good medical examination. The history is of particular importance; it is used to determine the fear elements which enter into a disorder. As an instance, a woman who feared snakes was given a realistic synthetic snake to handle. She did so without compunction. Asked why it had not disturbed her, she replied that it was not the snake itself that bothered her, but the eyes and the forked tongue. Any list of fears must include these items separately. For another example, Eysenck (1960) recorded the history of a man with impotence which was present only when attempting intercourse with his wife at home; he did not experience it anywhere else. It appeared that as a young man he had been surprised by an irate husband in the process of seducing his wife. The husband thrashed the patient within an inch of his life. It happened that the wall",

      "title": "The craziness in losing weight. A systematic review and case report of sibutramine’s psychosis",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sibutramine is an anorexigenic drug that has been used to treat obesity. After its commercialization, FDA ordered the suspension of its prescription in USA because of the adverse effects. It has structural similarities to amphetamine and is a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. The primary metabolites are responsible for the activity and inhibit the reuptake of noradrenalin and serotonin from the synaptic cleft. This substance can interfere with one of the known mechanisms of psychosis increasing dopaminergic transmission and leading to potential psychomimetic effects. Objectives The main objective in this paper is to obtain a critical evaluation of the literature regarding psychosis and sibutramine. There has been done a bibliographic review in databases such us SCOPUS, Web of Science, UptoDate and PubMed. This review was realized under certain criteria and keywords. The motivations behind this research were generated after an unusual clinical case (in symptomatology’s presentation). Sibutramine is a compound, which is not commercialized in the UE, so the diagnosis of the toxic psychosis was more complicated than the average psychedelics drugs. Methods To develop this review, numerous databases were chosen: PubMed, Scopus, UpToDate and Web of Science. However, only in PubMed we have obtain relevant results. For descriptors we have used two terms: “psychosis” and “sibutramine”. In this database, 27 results were obtained. With the criteria previously designed, which were free text access and works published in the last 20 years, only ten of them met all the criteria. With these ten articles, a systematic and qualitative analysis has been done, focusing on the ones which described similar cases. Results The sibutramine psychosis is difficult to identify. Frequently is mixed up with other substances in dietary supplements, which can appear as harmless. So, as clinics, we need to be careful, always considering this information in the clinical records. This case was peculiar; a 24 years old woman was consuming sibutramine as a compound in one supplement she was taken for losing weight. Three weeks prior to the consult the symptons started with an erotomaniac delusions, accompanied by disruptive behaviour, mood swings (dysphoria) and irritability. She was hospitalized and treated with antipsychotic medication (aripiprazole) showing a full recovery in five days. Conclusions Sibutramine can cause severe mental health disorders. As a compound of dietary supplements, can be easily acquired through online stores. Our work as clinics is to be vigilant of this kind of substances because of the danger that can generate. More studies should be done, to acquire knowledge of the psychobiological mechanisms involved in these cases. The prognosis seems to be positive, but there are certain risks in patients with unknown vulnerability factors. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "The submitted paper is a preliminary trial of comparison between two illnesses: depression (or affective disorders) and epilepsy. Despite specific phenotypical differences determining the diagnostic and classification belongings there are a lot of similarities or common elements between both groups of disorders. Special stress was put on the bioelectrical background or phenomena accompanying epilepsy and depression. Current knowledge about biochemical and structural background of depression is wide and enough well recognized. In contrast, studies on bioelectric conditions of depressive disorders are quite poor, despite the fact that the bioelectric phenomena are--beside biochemical processes--the immanent feature of nervous cells. Currently--apart from the kindling phenomenon--there is a lack of theories or hypotheses trying to explain the origin of depression (affective disorders) with perturbation of bioelectrical functions in neurons. Certain bioelectrical phenomena accompanying the different forms of antidepressant therapy (e.g. changing in the threshold level) are recognized as accidental side effects or not possessing the clinical meaning. The analysis conducted shows a necessity of intensifying experimental and clinical investigations over explaining the usefulness of the electric phenomena in the pathomechanism of depressive disorders.",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

Syndromet blev beskrevet af Hippokrates for ca. 2.500 ar siden [1]. To syndromer gav han betegnelserne phrenitis og lethargus, hvilket svarer til henholdsvis hyperaktivt og hypoaktivt delirium. Betegnelsen delirium blev indfort af den romerske feltlaege Celsus i ca. ar 30. Syndromet har haft mange forskellige navne helt op til vor tid. I faglitteraturen fra de seneste 30 ar kan der findes mindst 25 forskellige betegnelser for delirium. I 1980 blev begrebet delirium genindfort i den amerikanske diagnoseliste DSM-III, hvor der for forste gang blev opstillet specifikke diagnostiske kriterier for lidelsen. I ICD-10-diagnoselisten, der blev taget i brug i 1993, er delirium ogsa indfort som diagnose. De diagnostiske kernesymptomer ved delirium er vist i Tabel 1. Associerede symptomer kan vaere de mest dominerende og umiddelbart iojnefaldende [2, 3]. Afgorende for diagnosen er ofte den akutte debut og det svingende forlob i lobet af dognet samt forekomst af akut somatisk sygdom eller postoperativ tilstand hos en praedisponeret patient (hoj alder, kognitiv svaekkelse m.v.). Delirium inddeles i hypoaktivt, hyperaktivt og blandet delirium med fluktuerende hypoog hyperaktivitet [4, 5]. Karakteristiske forskelle mellem hypoog hyperaktivt delirium fremgar af Tabel 1. Hallucinationer og vrangforestillinger forekommer hyppigst ved hyperaktivt delirium (ca. 75%), men disse symptomer er ogsa hyppige ved hypoaktivt delirium (40-50%) [4]. En subtype vil i de fleste tilfaelde forblive samme subtype under hele forlobet [5]. Det er uafklaret, om subtyperne har forskellig aetiologi, patofysiologi og prognose [2-5]. Delirium bliver ofte underdiagnosticeret i akutmodtagelser, og dette gaelder isaer hypoaktivt delirium [3, 6, 7]. I Tabel 2 er angivet differentialdiagnoser ved delirium.",

      "abstract": "The vast majority of people with Alzheimer disease and other dementia show agitation, delusions, aggression, and other disruptive behaviors during their illness; and suffer and cause great distress because of them. Most patients with disruptive behaviors are prescribed psychotropics, presumably as attempts to ameliorate their problems. Researchers and governments have cautioned that the drugs may be both ineffective and dangerous. Review efficacy/effectiveness evidence for antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Review expert and committee recommendations, (e.g., the APA, ACNP, AAN, Alzheimer's Association, California Alzheimer Association, industry, regulatory organizations, and continuing medical education). The target symptoms and circumstances under which the drugs are used are vaguely described. Individual clinical trials generally do not show meaningful efficacy. Pooling trials reveals statistically significant modest effects for two antipsychotics and considerable adversity for the range of psychotropics. There is lack of evidence for long-term use even though the drugs are often used in this manner. Well-known adverse effects for antipsychotics include mortality, cardiovascular events, and sedation. Other drugs show substantial toxicity as well. Observed reduction in symptoms may be due to the soporific suppression of expressive behaviors. Expert panels tend to cautiously recommend the drugs, particularly antipsychotics, less so SSRIs; and antidepressants are prescribed more frequently than antipsychotics. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are also ineffective for disruptive behaviors but have a better safety profile. There is a lack of data supporting other classes of medications. The causes of these pleomorphic behaviors are not known even as their antecedents are and interventions can be made. Misinterpretation of trials outcomes may lead to poor medical practice. Short term use of antipsychotics and possibly other classes may help; longer use not. Despite the many trials and consensus panels there is overall limited information to inform physicians and patients beyond their potential for harm. Drug companies have pled guilty to fraud with respect to the drugs; and some law enforcement workers interpret their use in the elderly as assault with a deadly weapon subject to prosecution. As we try to develop treatments for AD we need to attend to societal concerns.",

      "abstract": "A craving or longing for alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs is common, especially in the early weeks and months of stopping substance use, regardless of how motivated clients are to stay substance-free. Cravings are mediated by brain activation in the amygdala region. Cravings can be activated by exposure to drug cues via classical conditioning. Memories associated with substance use can trigger a craving. Usually, cravings decrease in frequency and intensity as recovery progresses and the client abstains from substance use. The objectives of this chapter are to help the client identify and label a craving to use substances, to teach the client to monitor and rate the level of intensity of cravings, to identify internal and external factors that trigger cravings, and to teach cognitive, behavioral, environmental, and interpersonal strategies to manage alcohol or drug cravings.",

Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

Dicho aumento ha ido acompanado de un uso no medico en adultos, bien por motivos recreacionales o con la finalidad de aumentar el rendimiento, academico o profesional. ?Tienen estas situaciones alguna relacion? En la infancia se utilizan los psicoestimulantes para tratar una enfermedad, con lo que en sentido estricto se utilizan exclusivamente como terapia. Pero al haberse relajado la interpretacion de los criterios diagnosticos del TDAH se plantea una situacion diferente, de medicalizacion (proceso por el cual queda bajo el control medico una situacion previamente vivida como fuera de ese ambito), mas que de mejoramiento (uso de un farmaco o tecnologia para mejorar una actividad de un sujeto sano). El aumento del uso de psicoestimulantes en la infancia seria un caso de medicalizacion. Este uso cada vez mas frecuente en la infancia tendria un efecto normalizador, de uso cotidiano. En la adolescencia y edad adulta, con dificultad para mantener o establecer el diagnostico de TDAH, se podria usar con criterios diferentes, de automedicacion con la finalidad de mejoramiento. Se analiza si el concepto de �enfermedad� que utilicemos puede llevar a un mayor o menor uso de psicofarmacos en la infancia, y si podria influir tambien en la edad adulta.",

      "title": "Drug treatments for schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

Due to their potential as drugs of abuse, recreational use of most of these substances is illegal since the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In recent years, new psychoactive substances have emerged mainly as synthetic cathinones with new molecules frequently complementing the list. Psychostimulant related movement disorders are a known entity often seen in emergency rooms around the world. These admissions are becoming more frequent as are fatalities associated with drug abuse. Still the legal constraints of the novel synthetic molecules are bypassed. At the same time chronic and permanent movement disorders are much less frequently encountered. These disorders frequently manifest as a combination of movement disorders. The more common symptoms include agitation, tremor, hyperkinetic and stereotypical movements, cognitive impairment, and also hyperthermia and cardiovascular dysfunction. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind the clinical manifestations have been researched for decades. The common denominator is the monoaminergic signaling. Dopamine has received the most attention but further research has demonstrated involvement of other pathways. Common mechanisms linking psychostimulant use and several movement disorders exist.",

A growing body of research also demonstrates that SCT is uniquely associated with poorer functioning in various domains of major life activities, including academic difficulties (including poor organization, homework problems, and lower grade point average), social problems (especially peer withdrawal and isolation), and emotion dysregulation.

      "abstract": "The use of ketamine for treatment of comorbid pain, depression, and substance use disorders (SUDs) is becoming an option of increasing interest, as multiple clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy. Ketamine's efficacy in this diagnostically complex population is mechanistically based on a wide array of affected brain areas in addition to presynaptic neurons of the spine. Efficacy has been shown in both depressive and pain disorders with durability lasting 3 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of ketamine. Although ketamine itself is a drug of potential abuse when used recreationally, its lasting effects without repeated daily use have also shown promise for patients with SUDs. Assisted psychotherapy concurrent with ketamine treatment can help dependent patients cultivate new perceptions and ideals consistent with sobriety. Decreased opiate cravings in patients with SUDs may be related to ketamine's effects on reducing opiate-induced hyperalgesia. Given this and additional properties, ketamine can help reduce opiate medication burden, augment opiates in the hospice setting, or acutely alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal.

Recently developed measurements of stress, specifically the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS), allow a more focused perspective on the differing psychosocial pathways to psychiatric and physical disorder. This is the result of the level of measurement employed by the LEDS, whereby specific qualities of distress, such as losses, dangers, frustrations, and so on, can be distinguished from each other within the overall category of distressing/unpleasant experience. Studies of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, abdominal pain, appendectomy, menorrhagia, secondary amenorrhea, and myocardial infarction using the LEDS suggest that the specific qualities of the stressors involved in the onset of each condition may parallel similar predisposing vulnerabilities in the personalities of those becoming ill, and corresponding psychiatric conditions between stressor and somatic onset. An overall framework is outlined within which disorders are typified as more or less disengaged/overengaged, and suggestions are offered for future research.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacologically induced/exacerbated restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), and REM behavior disorder/REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) are increasingly recognized in clinical sleep medicine. A scoring system to evaluate the literature was created and implemented. The aim was to identify the evidence with the least amount of confound, allowing for more reliable determinations of iatrogenic etiology.Points were provided for the following criteria: manuscript type (abstract, peer-reviewed paper); population size studied (large retrospective study, small case series, case report); explicitly stated dosage timing; identification of peak symptoms related to time of medication administration (i.e., medication was ingested in the evening or at bedtime); initiation of a treatment plan; symptoms subsided or ceased with decreased dosage or drug discontinuation (for RLS articles only); negative personal history for RLS prior to use of the medication; exclusion of tobacco/alcohol/excessive caffeine use; exclusion of sleep disordered breathing by polysomnography (PSG); and PSG documentation of presence or absence of PLMS. For RLS and PLMS articles were also given points for the following criteria: each 2003 National Institutes of Health (NIH) RLS criteria met; exclusion of low serum ferritin; and exclusion of peripheral neuropathy by neurological examination.Thirty-two articles on drug-induced RLS, 6 articles on drug-induced PLMS, and 15 articles on drug-induced RBD/ RSWA were analyzed.Based on scores < or = 10 and trials of medication reduction/cessation, the strongest evidence available for drug induced RLS are for the following drugs: escitalopram; fluoxetine; L-dopa/carbidopa and pergolide; L-thyroxine; mianserin; mirtazapine; olanzapine; and tramadol. Since none of the PLMS articles assessed PLMI in trials of medication reduction/cessation, the strongest evidence based on scores > or = 10 are for the following drugs: bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Based on scores > or = 10 and/or trials of medication cessation, the strongest evidence for drug induced RBD/ RSWA is for the following drugs: clomipramine, selegiline, and phenelzine.",

In the field of clinical psychology, it is understood to contribute to many different forms of psychopathology (Whiteside &amp; Lynam, 2001). It is part of borderline personality disorder (a disorder characterized by emotional lability and ill‐considered, self‐harming acts); antisocial personality disorder (characterized by rash, ill‐thought out acts that often harm others); attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (characterized by difficulty waiting one's turn and persevering on tasks); bulimia nervosa (characterized by binge eating and subsequent purging); alcohol and drug‐use disorders; and a whole set of impulse‐control disorders, such as kleptomania, pyromania, and intermittent explosive disorder. For many of these forms of psychopathology, impulsivity is understood to contribute to their emergence.",

      "abstract": "Varying resistance to psychotherapy occurred in patients fantasying that the rapid removal of depressions was effected by a “miracle drug” which could be relied upon for “magical” solutions to future problems. Most patients easily transferred their desires for assistance from the medication to the psychotherapist who prescribed it (and might possibly have to do so again). The administration of adrenocorticosteroids, however, may result in undesirable complications. The medical contraindications to steroid therapy must be heeded, and constant watchfulness for the possible development of harmful physical side-effects is essential. Psychiatric and neurologic disturbances may follow the administration of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropin( 4, 5). A too rapid tapering of steroid dosage may result in a period of relative hypoadrenalism, thereby exacerbating and compounding psychiatric difficulties(5). During this study, reappearance of severe depressions occurred in 1 manicdepressive and 2 neurotic-depressives, in each case about 2 months after the discontinuation of medication. These relapses may indicate the necessity for maintaining the recovered depressive patient on small doses of steroids for periods approximating the average duration of previous phases of severe depression. In this study the rapid relief of depressive symptomatology afforded by therapy with prednisone accentuated the patients’ basic personality problems. In schizo-affectives, adequate doses of phenothiazines were needed to treat the intensification of psychotic thought disorders which began concurrently with the remission of depression. The treatment of patients having involutional psychotic depressions with some paranoid features likewise required phenothiazines to suppress the paranoid thought disorders which replaced their affective disorders.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is common in presenile population. The overlapping symptoms with other psychiatric disorders can lead to wrong/late diagnosis which cause delays/difficulties regarding case-management. Especially, long-standing and/or late-onset depression can descriptively envelop bvFTD (behavioral-variant) and leads to unnecessary treatments and increased distress. It’s important to implement a descriptive diagnostic algorithm which will help clinicians to distinguish the phenomenology of these disorders. Objectives This presentation aims to call attention of the clinicians/researchers to an elaborated effort concerning differential diagnosis of two common disorders with overlapping features through a case-study of a 59-year-old male patient. Methods One case from an inpatient unit of a psychiatric clinic in Lower Saxony, Germany will be reported. Results Case: The patient was referred to our acute-psychiatric-ward from the day-clinic-unit because of treatment-resistant, severe and long-lasting depressive symptoms. He was depressed, desperate, hopeless, listless and had suicidal thoughts. During the first days of treatment, symptoms like apathy, bad hygiene, weird eating-behavior, urinary incontinence, lack of empathy, language disorders and other behavioral symptoms were evident. Brain-MRI yielded frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Trail-Making-Test and Frontal-Assessment-Battery showed pronounced impairment of executive functions. Mini mental state examination and DemTect yielded light to moderate memory dysfunction. Diagnostic Criteria for Probable bvFTD (International-Consensus-Criteria) were fulfilled. Conclusions The diagnosis of bvFTD enabled a rapid assignment of a legal representative and relieved the long-lasting discomfort of the patient and his family that was caused by multiple unsuccessful treatment trials against depression. The differential diagnostic frame between bvFTD and depression will be discussed in view of the current literature. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

It can present as sensory symptoms in the hands and/or feet, typically in a “stocking-glove” pattern; pain, numbness, or tingling; or motor symptoms, manifested as weakness, cranial nerve deficits, or autonomic neuropathy. In a recent meta-analysis of 31 CIPn studies involving 4179 patients, the aggregate prevalence of CIPn was 48%. Within the first month of completing chemotherapy, the prevalence of CIPn was 68.1%; after 6 or more months of completing chemotherapy, the prevalence of CIPn decreased to 30.0%. The course of CIPn can be unpredictable, and although some symptoms may improve with time, others may persist or worsen as a result of permanent nerve damage. There are limited data on the natural history of CIPn in long-term cancer survivors, who are beyond 1 year of completing chemotherapy. Patients with breast cancer, who received taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, had neuropathy symptoms up to 2 years after completing treatment, and patients with colon cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy had numbness or tingling of hands and feet up to 6 years from starting treatment. One of the challenges in managing and preventing CIPn is that the exact pathophysiology is not well understood. The hypothesized mechanisms of taxane-induced neuropathy include the disruption of the axonal microtubule structure and a deficit in axonal energy supply from the toxic effect of chemotherapy on mitochondria in primary afferent neurons. CIPn due to vinca alkaloid therapy is thought to be due to alterations in the neuronal cytoskeleton that cause axonal degeneration. Platinum agents are thought to cause CIPn by exerting damage in the dorsal root ganglion through mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis, either by Dna crosslinking or oxidative stress. Despite investigations leading to hypotheses of several mechanisms of CIPn, none has resulted in clinically relevant therapeutic interventions. Several studies have attempted to identify risk factors for CIPn development, which also vary with different chemotherapeutic agents. Some of the clinical factors implicated in the development of CIPn include baseline neuropathy, the presence of diabetes, smoking history, and decreased creatinine clearance. In addition, there is interest in pharmacogenomics and identifying genes that may play a role in the development of CIPn. although numerous genes have been investigated, such as GSTP1, CYP2C8, and AGXT, there have been no conclusive findings. One of the clinical implications of CIPn is that the symptoms can result in treatment dose reduction or discontinuation, which may ultimately affect overall survival.

The excessive motor activity apparently is purposeless and is not influenced by external stimuli. There may be extreme negativism that is manifested by resistance to all instructions or the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved.

      "title": "Biomarcadores de estrés e inflamación en la psicosis temprana",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, de consecuencias devastadoras, que afecta como una persona piensa, siente y actua. Tiene un gran impacto en la salud de la poblacion, afectando entre 7 a 8 personas por cada 1.000. Mas alarmante es el hecho de que en Espana, los anos de vida potencialmente perdidos por muerte prematura o discapacidad atribuible, la situan en el primer lugar junto con otras enfermedades neurologicas. En la esquizofrenia se debe intervenir cuanto antes, ya que el tiempo de psicosis que transcurra sin tratar, conduce a la persona hacia una evolucion poco satisfactoria. Para cuando un joven reciba tratamiento por un trastorno psicotico incipiente, el dano neurologico y psicosocial ya habra ocurrido, afectando dominios fundamentales para su desarrollo como persona, que le aseguraran un futuro con peores logros educativos, mayor desempleo y una menor autonomia e independencia. No se conoce con exactitud como se origina la esquizofrenia, pero diversas variantes del genoma, al igual que los factores ambientales, el estres y la inflamacion, juegan un papel relevante. La evidencia acumulada demuestra tambien que en estos pacientes se encuentran niveles aumentados de marcadores inflamatorios (interleucina 6 [IL-6], proteina C reactiva [CRP] y fibrinogeno) y de prolactina (no asociado al tratamiento antipsicotico), ademas de un deterioro en la regulacion del eje hipotalamo-hipofisis-suprarrenal (HHS). El diagnostico de sujetos con alto riesgo de psicosis es eminentemente clinico, siendo perentoria la identificacion de posibles biomarcadores que contribuyan a aumentar el valor predictivo de los criterios de riesgo ultra elevado (UHR). Este trabajo de tesis doctoral se centra en el estudio de dichos biomarcadores, integrando el trabajo experimental al estudio de sujetos con estado mental de alto riesgo (EMAR) de psicosis y pacientes con un trastorno psicotico incipiente (TPI) que asisten a un centro de intervencion precoz, por lo que nos planteamos como supuesto fundamental, que el estres ambiental y los biomarcadores relacionados con el estres (cortisol y prolactina) y la inflamacion (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogeno y albumina), se asocian con el riesgo de desarrollar un TPI en las etapas iniciales de la psicosis. Para ello se determinaron los niveles de los distintos biomarcadores en suero (IL-6, CRP, albumina, cortisol y prolactina), plasma (fibrinogeno) y saliva (cortisol basal y respuesta del cortisol al despertar). Tambien se genotipo a partir del DNA genomico el SNP funcional del IL6 rs1800795. Se valoro clinicamente a los participantes mediante la adaptacion espanola del SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) a fin de obtener diagnosticos segun el DSM-IV. Se valoro el nivel de UHR en sujetos EMAR mediante la aplicacion de la CAARMS (Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States). Por ultimo, se midio la severidad de los sintomas positivos y negativos mediante la escala PANSS, el estres percibido mediante la Escala de Reajuste Social de Holmes-Rahe, la percepcion psicologica del estres aplicando la Escala de Estres Percibido, se valoro los habitos dieteticos mediante la entrevista clinica nutricional, y los sintomas depresivos aplicando las escalas de depresion de Hamilton (HDRS) y de Calgary para esquizofrenia (CDSS). Un primer estudio transversal demostro niveles aumentados de IL-6 en sujetos EMAR frente a controles sanos, y la asociacion positiva de la IL-6 con los sintomas negativos tanto en EMAR como en TPI, y la asociacion positiva (EMAR) y negativa (TPI) con los sintomas positivos. 35% de los sujetos EMAR hicieron la transicion a psicosis (EMAR-P) presentando un aumento no significativas del nivel de la IL-6 frente a quienes no la hicieron (EMAR-NP). Un segundo estudio, de caracter longitudinal, demostro niveles elevados de estres psicologico, prolactina y mas bajos de albumina en sujetos EMAR-P frente a los EMAR-NP y el grupo control. Tambien encontramos diferencias significativas en la secrecion de cortisol al despertar. En el tercer estudio de esta tesis doctoral, de caracter transversal, confirmamos la hipotesis que niveles bajos de los marcadores de inflamacion periferica (CRP y fibrinogeno) estan asociados con el tratamiento antidepresivo en sujetos con un TPI.",

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

Few posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes are more disruptive to interpersonal familial, societal, educational, and occupational functioning and activities than agitation, aggression, and violent behaviors. Agitation and irritability that occur in a patient during the acute stages of recovery from TBI not only endanger the safety of the patient and his or her caregivers but also predict increased lengths of hospital stay and impaired cognition (Bogner et al. 2001). As recovery continues, low frustration tolerance and explosive behavior may develop in response to minimal provocation or sometimes may occur without any warning at all. These behaviors may be limited to irritability or may include violent outbursts resulting in damage to property or assaults on others. In severe cases, it may be unsafe for individuals with aggressive disorders to remain in the community or with their families, and referral to long-term psychiatric or neurobehavioral facilities is sometimes required. All clinicians, and especially mental health professionals, need to be knowledgeable about and able to evaluate and treat neurologically induced agitation, irritability, aggression, and violence among their patients with TBI.",

Schizophrenia falls under the larger umbrella of psychosis, from which, in general terms, the patient has difficulty telling the real apart from the imaginary. Differentiating schizophrenia from other forms of psychosis is the first step, as certain psychotic symptoms can lead to illnesses other than schizophrenia. A full psychiatric evaluation that assesses a patient’s physical and mental states, among others, is generally used to weed out the possibilities and identify the types of schizophrenia the patient is suffering from. Additionally, it is not unheard of for schizophrenia to develop earlier than the established baseline of adolescence to young adulthood, although there is added difficulty in diagnosing childhood-onset schizophrenia due to the possibility of a child’s still-growing body as being partly responsible for some of the symptoms involved.",

In addition, the actual causes of fatigue are difficult to isolate, particularly in the person who is receiving palliative care because the symptom usually overlaps with concurrent disease-related problems such as malnutrition, sleep disturbances, pain, depression, asthenia, infections, and anemia. No consensus exists on the definition of fatigue or a standardized method of assessment. The working diagnosis used for the purpose of this review was “fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness, weakness or lack of energy” (Radbruch et al., 2008, p. 15).\r\nIn the context of palliative and advanced disease, fatigue can be viewed as an inevitable characteristic of the last phase of life. However, several pharmacologic treatments have been studied in an attempt to reduce the severity of the symptom and thereby improve the overall quality of life. Knowledge of effective medical treatments will be of particular interest to nurses who care for patients who frequently experience debilitating fatigue.",

      "title": "Low-Dose Clozapine for an Adolescent with TBI-Related Fregoli Delusions",
      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities. Had a history of MVA, 10 months ago, incurred severe TBI, admitt ed to ICU, discharged on prophylactic Valproate 1000 mg/d for posttraumatic seizures. He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment. He was seen by a private psychiatrist, a diagnosis of psychotic depression was entertained, and fluoxetine (Prozac",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD) is a common mental disorder, but it is rarely diagnosed and adequately treated. Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

      "title": "Role of Sertraline in insomnia associated with post traumatic brain injury (TBI) depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain. Treatment takes into account the aforementioned risk factors, plus interventions appropriate to the malfunctioning system.",

Patients A cohort of 93 nondemented patients with Parkinson disease enrolled in a prospective study of nonmotor and motor disease manifestations. Main Outcome Measure The presence of DAWS, defined as a severe, stereotyped cluster of physical and psychological symptoms that correlate with DA withdrawal in a dose-dependent manner, cause clinically significant distress or social/occupational dysfunction, are refractory to levodopa and other Parkinson disease medications, and cannot be accounted for by other clinical factors.Of 40 subjects treated with a DA, 26 underwent subsequent DA taper. Of these 26 subjects, 5 (19%) developed DAWS and 21 (81%) did not. All subjects with DAWS had baseline DA-related impulse control disorders. Symptoms of DAWS resembled those of other drug withdrawal syndromes and included anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia, depression, dysphoria, diaphoresis, fatigue, pain, orthostatic hypotension, and drug cravings. Subjects with DAWS as compared with those without DAWS had higher baseline DA use (mean [SD], 420 [170] vs 230 [180] DA levodopa equivalent daily doses [DA-LEDD], respectively; P = .04) and higher cumulative DA exposure (mean [SD], 1800 [1200] vs 700 [900] DA-LEDD-years, respectively; P = .03). Subjects with DAWS also had considerably lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores than those without DAWS (mean [SD], 21 [5] vs 31 [10], respectively; P = .007), despite comparable disease duration (mean [SD], 7.3 [7] vs 6.3 [4] years, respectively; P = .77) and similar total dopaminergic medication use (mean [SD], 830 [450] vs 640 [610] total LEDD, respectively; P = .52) in the 2 groups.Dopamine agonists have a stereotyped withdrawal syndrome that can lead to profound disability in a subset of patients.

Llegando a negativa para ingerir alimentos y permanencia en posición fija de sedestación, como elementos clave para la sospecha clínica y el diagnóstico oportuno. Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona.

Also, some of them have been shown to be effective in the depressive phase of unipolar mood illness.

Essentially, it may occur either for interactions (with other drugs or foods) or for biopharmaceutical issues. The risk arising from interactions is generally well characterised and physicians are well aware of it, and the importance of reporting cases of failure due to interactions is obvious. Less is known about the mechanisms and potential risk deriving from biopharmaceutical problems, and we will therefore focus on this issue. Biopharmaceutics describes the influence of the physical/chemical properties of the drug and drug product on the rate and extent of systemic drug absorption. Because after oral administration of solid pharmaceutical forms drugs must dissolve in gastrointestinal fluids before being absorbed through the intestinal epithelium, biopharmaceutical problems essentially arise from an insufficient dissolution performance. A typical situation where an insufficient dissolution may cause unexpected drug failure is when a patient is switched from one drug product to a different product. Different drug products with the same active substance may differ in manufacture and excipient composition.",

Although a definite association between cannabis use and suicidal ideation or behavior has been already reported in the literature, the described case presents two original clinical aspects that deserve consideration. First, episodic assumption of cannabis induced suicidal ideation abruptly. Second, suicidal ideation appeared independent of mood depression, stressors, or life events, suggesting that suicidality may be not a direct consequence of depression and appears to be a relatively independent psychopathological dimension. There seems to be no linear relation between the severity of depression and the risk of suicide.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

Symptoms of this nature, which can include frightening hallucinations or anxiety of phobic proportions, are subjectively distressing and can lead both to unsafe or violent situations as well as to the preventable use of inappropriate medication, physical restraint, and frequently to institutionalization. These psychopathologic manifestations of dementia often prove to be a burden on family, caregivers, and the health care system as well.

Es necesario llamar la atencion sobre este hecho, ya que muchas veces se cre que la dependencia supone en todas los casos una dependencia fisica unida a la necesidad de aumentar la dosis de la droga. Por el contrario, a veces se descarta erroneamente la existencia de dependencia cuando no se observa un incremento en la dosificacion. \nSe ha descrito ademas una serie de trastornos que aumentan la necesidad de administrarse el medicamento o la droga independientemente del tiempo de evolucion de la dependencia.

For years, there has been a controversy as to whether addiction was simply a moral failing or a brain disease. Obviously, the latter is true. As with any disease, addiction and co-occurring disorders are frequently considered to be primary, progressive, chronic, and, if untreated, fatal. With the advent of more sophisticated neurobiological and multivariate research, we can get beyond trivializing this serious disease entity by labeling it as a weakness or character defect, and get on with the significant work of focusing on those neurological pathways and their etiology that are responsible for addictive patterns of behavior.",

It acts as a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, inducing a dissociative state that manifests as catalepsy, unconsciousness and amnesia. Recreational use of ketamine and the number of illicit seizures of ketamine have increased in recent years, prompting a review of current evidence on its toxicity. Recreational ketamine use is associated with a number of toxic effects, both acute and chronic. Predominant among the acute effects are psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and aggression, which can lead to serious injuries. Chronic ketamine use leads to intractable urological problems and neuropsychiatric problems, Long-term effects also include gastrointestinal problems such as abdominal pain and liver function abnormalities. This review summarizes current evidences on the acute and chronic ketamine toxicity associated with its recreational use.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic and disabling mental disorder characterized by periods of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. It affects individuals in their personal, school, and professional lives. While the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown, it often runs in families, and factors like premature birth, low birth weight, alcohol, smoking, and drug abuse during pregnancy may contribute to it. ADHD is typically classified into three main types: hyperactive/impulsive type, which involves excessive movement, restlessness, and impulsive actions; inattentive type, which includes difficulty staying focused on tasks, organizing work, losing things, and being easily distracted; and combined type, which is diagnosed when both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms are present.",

      "title": "Effects of ozone treatment on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a promising research area",
      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of chemotherapy (CT), which involves mainly platinum-derived drugs, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and proteasome inhibitors. The usual symptoms of CIPN are numbness and tingling, hypoesthesia or allodynia, pain, loss of strength, and alterations in proprioception or thermal sensitivity. CIPN can become chronic, persist for months or years after completing CT, and be associated with and worsen other symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fatigue. CIPN affects the ability to carry out activities of daily living and markedly reduces patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL).1,2 When CIPN occurs during treatment, it can lead to a decreased CT dose or even premature withdrawal, with a subsequent negative impact on cancer prognosis. Current status of CIPN: Unfortunately, prophylactic and therapeutic measures for managing CIPN are very limited in number and degree of effectiveness.1 Duloxetine is the only evidence-based treatment, but only for \"pain\" management, with a \"moderate degree\" of recommendation, given the \"modest magnitude of its benefit.1\" In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), compared with the placebo group (0.34), duloxetine provided a pain reduction of 1.06 points on a 10-point scale (using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form \"average pain\"), which disappeared 1 week after stopping the treatment, and it is a treatment associated with potential side effects.3 Although multiple treatments are usually administered for the management of numbness and tingling secondary to CIPN (such as venlafaxine, oxcarbazepine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and several antioxidants), the Clinical Guideline of the American Society of Medical Oncology established that there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use outside of RCTs.1 Moreover, the development and evaluation of new strategies to mitigate and manage the chronic side effects of cancer treatments (CIPN included) was established as an area of urgent research by the American Society of Medical Oncology.4 The pathogenesis of CIPN is multifactorial, and different combinations of factors are likely predominant for different drugs. Alterations have been described in the following aspects: i) microtubule activity; ii) ion channel activity (Na, K, Ca, transient receptor potential channels); iii) DNA (with subsequent alterations and dysregulation of intracellular transcriptional and signaling pathways, particularly those associated with DNA repair and apoptosis); iv) mitochondrial functions and cellular metabolism (with a local increase in oxidative stress and scavenger alterations); v) local alterations in the immune system (with local processes of neuroinflammation and microischemia); and vi) myelin alterations and axonal degeneration.2,5 Ozone (O3) treatment (O3T): O3 is a highly reactive compound composed of three oxygen (O2) atoms with higher oxidizing power than O2, meaning that it can chemically react with different substances by adding an atom of oxygen (or removing electrons) to its molecular structure. Because its oxidizing properties produce lung toxicity, O3T must always be carried out to avoid airway exposure to O3.6 Medical O3 is produced from medical-grade O2 using certified medical O3 generators. Its clinical use is based on an O3/O2 mixture at different concentrations, where O2 continues to be the most frequent component of the mixture (95–99%), with only a small percentage of O3 (< 1–5%). Owing to its short half-life (approximately 25 minutes at 30°C), the O3/O2 gas mixture cannot be encapsulated or stored and must be produced and administered in situ. The two main routes of O3/O2 administration that induce systemic effects are autohemotherapy and rectal insufflation. Using any of those approaches, O3T can produce an indirect systemic effect by inducing an adaptive response of the tissue and organism. O3 does not bind to specific receptors, nor does it follow the usual principles of pharmacology: it does not circulate through the bloodstream, nor does it follow the processes of distribution, metabolism or elimination. At adequate concentrations and for administration, O3/O2 interacts with the mucosa of the colon and rectum (rectal route) or with blood components (intravenous route). This produces rapid, moderate, and \"controlled\" oxidative stress at the local level, especially through interactions with double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids, with the disappearance of O3 and the generation of O3 peroxides i) intracellularly, with further actions as second messengers, and ii) extracellularly, as alkenals (mainly 4-hydroxynonenal), which can reach distant tissues through the bloodstream. These second messengers can modulate the glutathione redox system and activate nuclear transcription factors such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, which induces the transcription of antioxidant response elements and the subsequent increase in antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, at moderate O3 concentrations, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 can also induce a decrease in the activity of Nfkb (nuclear factor kappa B, with proinflammatory action), which is one of the immune pathways modulated by O3T and leads to anti-inflammatory action. Additionally, O3/O2 can induce the activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase metabolism in red blood cells (with a further increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and a shift to the right of the oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve) as well as nitric oxide liberation by the microvasculature, with potential improvements in oxygen delivery to tissues and blood flow, respectively.6 In this way, O3/O2 can facilitate local autoregulation of ischemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation, with potential beneficial effects on diseases mediated by factors such as chronic ischemic diseases or inflammatory diseases. In the same way, these potential effects of O3/O2 look promising against some of the mechanisms involved in the production of CIPN that we have mentioned above. Two reviews have described the potential mechanisms of action and potential role of O3T in CIPN.5,7 Additionally, the potential role of the gut microbiota in CIPN has also been suggested, which could offer another potential target for the mechanism of action of O3T. Experience in O3T of CIPN: Because of the limited therapeutic options available for CIPN, treatments are usually offered to patients based on their mechanisms of action or their usefulness in other similar conditions, even if they have not proven effective in CIPN. With the same approach, according to the mechanisms of action of O3/O2, our multidisciplinary chronic pain unit offers O3T for the management of patients when symptoms are refractory to usual treatments, do not have effective treatment, or conventional treatment is potentially associated with high morbidity. In our hospital, the compassionate use of the O3T approach was approved by the Health Care Ethics Committee (September 20, 2017). This decision was based on the 37th Article of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza 2013). Currently, in our center, O3T is prospectively evaluated with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Las Palmas (April 29, 2022), which is registered in the Spanish Clinical Studies Registry (REEC 0063-2022-OBS) and ClinicalTrials.org (NCT05417737). Therefore, our current experience with O3T in CIPN patients is focused on different symptoms associated with CIPN and is based on compassionate use in a limited number of patients, pending subsequent evaluation in RCTs. The next paragraphs describe our main preliminary findings using O3T in CIPN. (Further details are shown in Additional Table 1. https://links.lww.com/MGAR/A98) The first report8 assessed 11 different locations (four hands and seven feet) in a group of seven patients with chronic pain secondary to CIPN (median age of 49 years, range: 36–73 years). Before submission for compassionate O3T, patients' symptoms were under unsuccessful treatment for a median time of 12 months. Rectal O3T provided significant and clinically relevant pain relief. A decrease in pain was reported by 86% of the patients. According to the visual analog scale (VAS), the pain level significantly decreased at the end of O3T (VAS score from 7 to 4) and remained significantly reduced 3 months (VAS score: 5.5) and 6 months (VAS score: 6) after the end of O3T. This long-lasting effect of O3T in CIPN pain is consistent with the protracted effect described in the management of some radiation-induced toxicities.9 The initial magnitude of the effect on the VAS score (3 points on a 10-point scale) and duration of improvement (6 months) compared favorably with those described for duloxetine (a 1-point decrease in a 10-point scale that disappeared 1 week after the end of duloxetine treatment) (Figure 1).Figure 1: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): clinical changes at the end of O 3 T.Clinical details before O3T and at the end of O3T: i) Pain, assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS), from 0 (better) to 10 (worse); ii) Health status (EQ-VAS) included in the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire, from 0 (worse) to 100 (better); and iii) Grade of toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0) scale of the National Cancer Institute of EEUU, from 0 (no toxicity) to 5 (death). P value of paired comparisons according to the exact (significance) Wilcoxon rank test. Box: Quartiles 1 and 3; O3T: ozone treatment; X: median value.The second report10 described 26 cancer survivors treated with rectal O3T because of persistent or refractory side effects of cancer treatment. The analysis of the subgroup of 15 patients with CIPN revealed statistically significant improvements in all five domains of the EQ-5D-5 L HRQOL questionnaire (developed by the EuroQol Group), which includes mobility, self-care capacity, ability to carry out activities of daily living, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The median value of the self-evaluation of health status (EQ-VAS) included in the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire (from 0 (worse) to 100 (better)) also significantly improved after O3T (from 50 to 75). Additionally, after O3T, there was a significant improvement in the grade of CIPN toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0) scale of the National Cancer Institute of EEUU. This work revealed that O3T could improve CIPN toxicity, and patients positively evaluated the impact of O3T on their HRQOL (Figure 1). A final report in 202311 specifically evaluated the impact of O3T on anxiety and depression in 16 patients treated because of refractory symptoms of severe diseases, most of which were secondary to CIPN. In this work, after O3T, patients reported a significant improvement in i) the anxiety/depression dimension of the general EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire and ii) both subscales (anxiety and depression) of the focused Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Both subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were significantly i) correlated with the anxiety/depression dimension of the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire and ii) inversely correlated with self perceived health status. However, in this study, it was not possible to determine whether the improvement in anxiety and depression was a direct effect of O3T or if it was partially related to the improvement in physical symptoms reported by most of the patients. In the complementary management of these patients, O3T was planned by rectal insufflation, 40 sessions in 4 months. Initial pharmacological treatments were maintained during O3T and were further reduced or removed in many patients when clinically indicated. Rectal insufflation of O3/O2 was well tolerated. The main side effects of O3T were soft and transient meteorism and bowel bloating, as expected with this O3T approach. The mild side effects of the procedure were described in our different manuscripts and are consistent with large reviews.12 In these works, many patients receiving O3T also reported improvements in different symptoms associated with CIPN, such as numbness and tingling, and alterations in hand and foot proprioception, a sense of balance, thermal sensitivity, or desire and sexual potency. However, these are encouraging but unpublished data, and they are currently under evaluation. These reports evaluated patients with refractory symptoms of CIPN after many months (median more than 12 months) of conventional management and revealed relevant clinical improvement (in magnitude and duration) after 4 months of O3T. These findings are encouraging and merit further research in a clinical condition (CIPN) without established therapy, except for the described effect of duloxetine on painful CIPN. However, these preliminary studies have two notable limitations: they were non-RCTs and had small sample sizes. Therefore, the results must be evaluated with caution. Focused RCTs are needed to validate these preliminary results. Currently, our hospital is carrying out two related RCTs in patients with CIPN: i) one focused on \"pain\" (EU CT ID: 2024-518021-16-00, NCT04299893) and ii) another ongoing RCT focused on \"numbness and tingling\" (EU CT ID: 2024–517196–20–00 and NCT06706544). Additionally, a prospective study is evaluating the impact of O3T on HRQOL, anxiety, and depression in cancer and noncancer patients treated with symptomatic and compassionate intention (AEMPS/REEC: 0063-2022-OBS, NCT05417737) in our chronic pain unit. Multicenter collaboration could facilitate and accelerate these advances and further research. Conclusion: CIPN is a common side effect of CT, with a potentially high impact on the administration of CT and the HRQOL of patients. Except for the small benefit of duloxetine for pain related to CIPN, there are limited therapeutic options for the different symptoms associated with CIPN. Few preliminary reports suggest that O3T could offer clinically relevant improvements in different symptoms associated with CIPN. The magnitude and duration of these results merit further focused research. RCTs are ongoing.

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "title": "Behavioural Effects of Anti‐epileptic Drugs",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY There is increasing evidence that various types of behavioural disturbance, other than those described for phenytoin, for example, may occur from the use of anti‐epileptic medication, and it has been suggested that these disturbances may not always be reversible. There are suspicions also that certain groups of patients—especially those with structural brain damage—are particularly susceptible. These and other factors relevant to the study of the effects of anti‐epileptic drugs on behaviour are comprehensively reviewed. It is concluded that the psycho‐pharmacology of anti‐epileptic drugs is unsatisfactory at present because of inadequate and unsophisticated reporting of behavioural change and because of the common problem of polypharmacy, and that more accurate observations are needed on less heterogeneous groups of patients than have been described in the past. RÉSUMÉ Effets des medications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement Il devient de plus en plus évident que des types variés de troubles du comportement, autres que ceux traditionnellement attribués à la phénytoïne, par exemple, peuvent suivre l'emploi de medication anti‐épileptique; il a même été suggéré que ces troubles ne sont pas toujours réversibles. Certaines indications laissent à penser que certains groupes de malades, notamment ceux qui présentent des troubles cérébraux structuraux, sont particulièrement sensibles. Ces faits et les autres facteurs relevant d'une étude de l'action des médications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement sont systématiquement analysés. L'auteur concluent qu'à l'heure actuelle la psychopharmacologie des médications anti‐épileptiques n'est pas satisfaisante en raison de rapports inadéquats et non qualifiés sur les troubles du comportement ainsi que sur le problème commun des associations médicamenteures. Il est indispensable de disposer d'observations plus précises, de groupes de malades moins hétérogènes que ce qui a été fait dans le passé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verhaltenseinflüsse von Antiepileptika Es gibt zunehmend Hinweise darauf, daß verschiedene Arten von Verhaltensstörungen, andere als die zum Beispiel traditionell vom Diphenylhydantoin beschriebenen, bei der Anwendung von Antiepileptika auftreten können; es wurde vermutet, daß die Störungen nicht in alien Fällen reversibel sein könnten. Es gibt weiterhin Vermutungen, daß eine bestimmte Gruppe von Patienten—besonders solche mit strukturellen Hirnschädigungen—im besonderen dafür empfänglich sind. Es wird eine umfassende Übersicht dieser und anderer, für diese Studie der Effekte antikonvulsiver Medikamente auf das Verhalten relevanter Faktoren gegeben. Es wird festgestellt, daß die Psychopharmakologie der Antikonvulsiva zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt unzureichend ist, da adäquate und sorgfältige Berichte über Verhaltensanderungen und die allgemeinen Probleme der Polypharmazie fehlen; es werden genauere Beobachtungen an weniger heterogenen Patientengruppen benötigt, als sie bisher beschrieben sind. RESUMEN Efectos sobre la conducta de los fármacos antiepilépticos Hay una evidencia creciente de que diversos tipos de alteraciones en el comportamiento, además de los ya tradicionalmente descritos para la fenitoína por ejemplo, pueden aparecer por el uso de medicación antiepiléptica, y se ha sugerido que estas alteraciones no siempre pueden ser reversibles. Hay sospechas también de que algunos grupos de pacientes, especialmente aquellos con lesión estructural cerebral, sen particularmente susceptibles. Se revisan de forma complet estos y otros factores en relación con el estudio de los efectos de los fármacos antiepilépticos sobre el comportamiento. Se concluye que la psicofarmacología de los fármacos antiepilépticos no es satisfactoria en el momento presente debido a unas comunicaciones inadecuadas o no sofisticadas sobre los cambios del comportamiento y el problema común de la polifarmacia, y que es necesaria una observación más atenta en grupos de pacientes menos heterogéneos de los que han sido descritos en el pasado.",

      "title": "S69. A CASE STUDY OF CLOZAPINE AND COGNITION: FRIEND OR FOE?",
      "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is as a hallmark feature of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medication is effective for treating the positive symptoms of psychosis, but their potential for therapeutic effects on cognition continues to divide researchers. Improvements in clinical symptoms can occur independently of cognitive functioning, whereby typical antipsychotics improve different clinical domains, but have little or no efficacy for improving primary cognitive functions. However, it has been suggested that the second-generation antipsychotic clozapine can improve cognition in schizophrenia. Unusual cases, such as remitted patients who decide to stop taking clozapine, thus represent a unique opportunity to understand the effect of antipsychotic medication on cognition, as described in the case study below. A 38-year old man suffered severe psychotic episodes at age 19, leading to a diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine was initiated at age 21, with excellent treatment response and complete remission of positive, negative and depressive symptoms. For the following 16 years, he had a full-time paid job, lived independently and had an ample social circle. For the last five years, he was stable and compliant taking 175 mg of clozapine, with clozapine levels in sub-therapeutic range (between 0.17 and 0.26 mg/L). He had no metabolic syndrome and no oversedation, but complained of hypersalivation and persistent memory problems. He decided, against advice, that medication was no longer needed and requested support for waning off clozapine. A five-month program was subsequently implemented, with 25 mg reductions of clozapine every six weeks. Four enhanced assessments were scheduled after two weeks on stable doses of 125, 75, 25 and 0 mg, respectively, which included the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia scale (CGI-SCH). At each level of clozapine dose, the patient continued to be stable. However, the patient showed impaired cognitive performance at the highest dose of clozapine titration (see T-scores from Table and figure), with improvements then shown at each level of dose reduction (75 and 25 mg). The final assessment was done after 6 weeks of not taking medication. At this time, he was admitted to hospital for psychotic relapse. Unfortunately, the patient refused to re-initiate clozapine and has remained floridly psychotic for 18 months. Our case suggests that cognitive impairment is dose-dependent with clozapine. As presented, the t-score of the patient at 125 mg was worse than normative data reported for healthy controls (z-score=0.50) and patients with schizophrenia treated with other first-or second generation antipsychotics (z-score=-1.42). However, cognitive performance of the patient was most notably impaired when medication-free. The longterm effects of high-dose antipsychotic medication on cognition in patients with schizophrenia are largely unknown. It is also possible that changes in cognitive states are either domain-specific with clozapine. Nonetheless, daily antipsychotic dose and polypharmacy have been shown to predict poor cognitive functioning. The present case is also a reminder that the appropriate long-term maintenance dose of clozapine is poorly understood. As this case suggests, the current recommended therapeutic levels of clozapine (0.35 to 0.50 mg/L) might be unnecessarily high for patients in full remission. Controlled studies are therefore needed to evaluate the potential for cognitive improvements in schizophrenia as a function of reduced clozapine dose, to ensure the optimal delivery needed not just for good clinical but also good cognitive outcome.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a pervasive and prevalent mental health disorder among prisoners, yet it frequently remains undiagnosed due to the phenomenon of diagnostic overshadowing - a clinical bias where prominent conditions or contexts obscure less obvious mental health issues. This review explores diagnostic overshadowing as a key barrier to identifying depression in people in custody, focusing on diagnostic failures, their consequences, and solutions. We review global literature on depression prevalence, which affects prisoners at significantly higher rates than the general population, yet it is frequently misdiagnosed or goes unrecognized due to overshadowing by the more prominent features of substance use, challenging behaviours or the prison context itself. Failure to recognize readily treatable depressive disorders because of diagnostic overshadowing results in serious but avoidable consequences, including elevated suicide rates, increased recidivism, and other adverse outcomes such as substance abuse and institutional violence, which collectively and individually perpetuate the cycle of personal distress and dysfunction, as well as the human and associated costs to others in society. By describing and highlighting diagnostic overshadowing as a particular problem in correctional settings, and by exploring its mechanisms in correctional psychiatry settings, we advocate for solutions for more reliable recognition of depression in prisoners, which is an essential first step to effectively address this readily treatable but easily overlooked serious mental disorder.",

One of the few psychiatric conditions that is defined by an illegal activity, kleptomania has been classified as one of the impulse control disorders under ICD-10 and DSM IV-TR. In terms of assessment, it is not sufficient merely to look at the operational criteria. One should take a complete history and probe for predisposing factors including childhood development and behaviour, previous relationships, losses, and habits. It is also necessary to detect current stressors and concomitant symptoms or disorders that may precipitate and perpetuate the condition. Some of the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective claim or report which may be unreliable. The use or value of the articles stolen is relative but may be easier to assess. As a guide, kleptomania should be a diagnosis by exclusion of other contributing disorders. When other contributing symptoms/disorders such as depression are present, care should be exercised before a diagnosis of kleptomania is made.",

Emotional control, when we consider that almost always the patient, if an adult, knows he is suffering from a very serious disease, is usually better than would be expected. When, then, mental symptoms do occur, three questions arise: (1) Is the abnormal mental state a mere accidental complication, merely happening at the time of the tetanus and in no way caused by it? (2) Is it due to the medication employed?

      "abstract": "In this Part II psychiatric disorders coexisting with organic diseases are discussed. \"Comorbidity phenomenon\" defines the not univocal interrelation between medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders, each other negatively influencing morbidity and mortality. Most severe psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, show increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, related to poverty, use of psychotropic medication, and higher rate of preventable risk factors such as smoking, addiction, poor diet and lack of exercise. Moreover, psychiatric and organic disorders can develop together in different conditions of toxic substance and prescription drug use or abuse, especially in the emergency setting population. Different combinations with mutual interaction of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders are defined by the so called \"dual diagnosis\". The hypotheses that attempt to explain the psychiatric disorders and substance abuse relationship are examined: (1) common risk factors; (2) psychiatric disorders precipitated by substance use; (3) psychiatric disorders precipitating substance use (self-medication hypothesis); and (4) synergistic interaction. Diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty concerning the problem of dual diagnosis, and legal implications, are also discussed. Substance induced psychiatric and organic symptoms can occur both in the intoxication and withdrawal state. Since ancient history, humans selected indigene psychotropic plants for recreational, medicinal, doping or spiritual purpose. After the isolation of active principles or their chemical synthesis, higher blood concentrations reached predispose to substance use, abuse and dependence. Abuse substances have specific molecular targets and very different acute mechanisms of action, mainly involving dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems, but finally converging on the brain's reward pathways, increasing dopamine in nucleus accumbens. The most common substances producing an addiction status may be assembled in depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates), stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine, caffeine, modafinil), hallucinogens (mescaline, LSD, ecstasy) and other substances (cannabis, dissociatives, inhalants). Anxiety disorders can occur in intoxication by stimulants, as well as in withdrawal syndrome, both by stimulants and sedatives. Substance induced mood disorders and psychotic symptoms are as much frequent conditions in ED, and the recognition of associated organic symptoms may allow to achieve diagnosis. Finally, psychiatric and organic symptoms may be caused by prescription and doping medications, either as a direct effect or after withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions can be divided in type A, dose dependent and predictable, including psychotropic drugs and hormones; and type B, dose independent and unpredictable, usually including non psychotropic drugs, more commonly included being cardiovascular, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic medications.",

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited.

      "abstract": "A esquizofrenia é uma doença mental crônica que afeta a maneira como uma pessoa pensa, sente e se comporta. Caracterizada por sintomas como delírios, alucinações, confusão e dificuldade de concentração, seus sintomas podem variar em intensidade e frequência, geralmente se manifestando na adolescência ou início da idade adulta. Afetando cerca de 1% da população mundial, a esquizofrenia tem raízes em uma complexa interação entre fatores genéticos, neurobiológicos e ambientais. Alterações nos neurotransmissores, como dopamina e glutamato, desempenham um papel significativo na fisiopatologia da doença, que também está ligada a anomalias estruturais e funcionais do cérebro. O diagnóstico da esquizofrenia é feito através de uma avaliação clínica detalhada, com critérios estabelecidos como os do DSM-5 ou CID-10. O tratamento geralmente envolve uma combinação de medicamentos antipsicóticos, como clorpromazina, haloperidol, olanzapina, risperidona e quetiapina, e terapia psicossocial. A escolha do medicamento depende de vários fatores, incluindo a gravidade dos sintomas e a tolerabilidade do paciente. Embora esses medicamentos sejam eficazes no controle dos sintomas, eles podem estar associados a efeitos colaterais, e é essencial monitorar de perto os pacientes durante o tratamento. Um estudo recente revisou a literatura dos últimos 5 anos sobre métodos terapêuticos medicamentosos para o controle da esquizofrenia. Foram selecionados 6 estudos que abordaram tratamentos eficazes para a esquizofrenia, incluindo medicamentos como xanomelina, tróspio, dexmedetomidina, raloxifeno, tropissetron, blonanserina e olanzapina. Esses estudos mostraram redução dos sintomas da esquizofrenia, apesar de apresentarem diferentes perfis de efeitos colaterais e eficácia. Mais pesquisas são necessárias para compreender totalmente o potencial de cada medicamento no tratamento desse transtorno. Em suma, a esquizofrenia é uma condição que requer uma abordagem holística e colaborativa, com tratamentos eficazes e monitoramento cuidadoso dos pacientes para melhorar sua qualidade de vida.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

Exacerbations bear clinical and prognostic relevance, and may result in marked functional and clinical deterioration. The varying presentations of COPD mean that exacerbations, although more frequent in patients with severe or very severe disease, may occur regardless of the degree of functional impairment. The new Spanish COPD Guideline (GesEPOC) has provided new insights into the management of the disease. The GesEPOC defines various disease phenotypes with different clinical, prognostic and therapeutic implications. One of these phenotypes is the so-called 'exacerbator', characterized by the incidence of an increased number of exacerbations (two or more moderate–severe exacerbations in the last year). An exacerbation must be defined by: an increase in symptom intensity occurring after a certain period of time since the last exacerbation (so that treatment failure can be excluded as the cause of the event); and the contribution of social criteria or reasons concerning the choice of therapy. The availability of certain tools to detect exacerbations would enable establishment of a homogeneous definition of exacerbation, and improved diagnosis, a suitable treatment choice and a more appropriate patient selection for clinical studies. Validated clinical questionnaires and biomarkers are the most helpful instruments to reach the above objectives. Following the clinical diagnosis of a COPD exacerbation, associated comorbidities must be evaluated and an etiologic diagnosis must be made, all of which will partially drive the choice of treatment. Once a diagnosis has been made, the severity of the exacerbation should be established in order to define where and how the patient should be treated. Based on the patient's clinical history, clinical examination and diagnostic tests, the severity will be classified in one of these four degrees: very severe, severe, moderate and mild.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia requires both a report of poor sleep at night and residual daytime impairment associated with the poor sleep. Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "AbstractGambling disorders are a serious public health problem. This manuscript will provide a comprehensive overview on this topic. Gambling disorder involves repeated patterns of gambling behaviors, that result in significant distress or impairment in a person’s interpersonal relationships, employment, educational/career opportunities, and finances over a period of 12 months. Gambling is defined as an activity that involves risking something of value with the hopes of acquiring something of greater value. Comparable to substance use disorders, individuals with a gambling disorder may be unsuccessful in exercising control over their problematic behavior, engage in the behavior despite negative consequences, and have preoccupations/cravings to gamble. Gambling disorder has higher comorbidity rates of mental disorders including depression, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders. Gamblers rarely seek treatment. Treatments must be tailored to the individual which may include psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, gamblers anonymous, and psychopharmacological agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and opioid antagonists to treat clinical symptoms.

      "title": "Análise da prevalência de Síndrome Metabólica e fatores de risco associados em pacientes com Esquizofrenia Refratária",
      "abstract": "APRESENTACAO: A esquizofrenia e uma doenca cronica, incapacitante, que afeta mais de 21 milhoes de pessoas em todo o mundo. E concebida, na atualidade, como um transtorno mental persistente e complexo, caracterizado por um conjunto de sinais e sintomas que incluem discurso e comportamento desorganizados, delirios, alucinacoes e alteracao na cognicao. O tratamento baseia-se, essencialmente, no uso de medicamentos denominados antipsicoticos, associados a terapias psicossociais. Cerca de 30% das pessoas que possuem esquizofrenia nao apresentam melhora do quadro clinico, sendo denominadas refratarias ou resistentes ao tratamento. Os diferentes mecanismos fisiopatologicos desse transtorno podem estar envolvidos em sua etiologia. Apesar de nao existir um consenso unico e globalmente aceito, a esquizofrenia refrataria pode ser caracterizada quando nao ha melhora dos principais sintomas apos o tratamento com dois antipsicoticos de classes diferentes (sendo pelo menos um atipico), em doses adequadas, durante um determinado periodo de tempo (4-6 ou 6-8 semanas). O tratamento medicamentoso de escolha, para os casos de esquizofrenia resistente (ou refrataria), e a prescricao do antipsicotico atipico clozapina. Ja a Sindrome metabolica (SM) caracteriza-se por um conjunto de fatores de risco para diabetes mellitus do tipo 2 e doencas cardiovasculares, tendo como componentes centrais a obesidade abdominal, resistencia a insulina, dislipidemia e hipertensao. Alem disso, tambem esta associada ao desenvolvimento de doencas hepaticas, respiratorias, osteoarticulares e câncer. Em pacientes com esquizofrenia, estima-se que, aproximadamente, 34% das mortes entre pessoas do sexo masculino e 31% naquelas do sexo feminino sejam atribuidas a doenca cardiovascular, o que so e superado pelo suicidio. Desta forma, apresenta-se como uma condicao complexa que acarreta alto custo social e economico para os sistemas de saude e familias, atingindo todas as populacoes do mundo. Pessoas que possuem esquizofrenia apresentam um risco aumentado para alteracoes metabolicas, em comparacao ao da populacao geral. Este artigo foi elaborado com o objetivo de estimar a prevalencia de sindrome metabolica (SM) e os fatores associados, segundo as variaveis sociodemograficas, clinicas e comportamentais em pacientes com esquizofrenia refrataria em uso de clozapina. METODOLOGIA: Foi realizado um estudo de delineamento transversal na Regiao Ampliada Oeste do Estado de Minas Gerais (MG). A populacao foi composta por 169 pessoas que constavam no cadastro da Superintendencia Regional de Saude (SRS) dessa regiao, com diagnostico medico de esquizofrenia refrataria que estavam em uso do antipsicotico atipico clozapina, maiores de 18 anos, de ambos os sexos e com capacidade de entendimento. O calculo amostral foi realizado, utilizando-se o programa OpenEpi, versao 3.03a, considerando-se uma populacao de 169 individuos para uma proporcao esperada do evento de 50%, um nivel de significância de 5% e margem de erro de 10%, estimando-se uma amostra de, aproximadamente, 62 individuos. A amostra final foi composta por todos os pacientes que compareceram ao CAPS de Divinopolis, durante o periodo de coleta de dados (dezembro de 2014 a junho de 2015), totalizando-se 72 individuos. Foram excluidas do estudo as mulheres gravidas, os participantes que nao estavam em jejum e aqueles que apresentaram qualquer condicao que pudesse interferir na coleta e mensuracao dos dados. O projeto foi aprovado pelo Comite de Etica em Pesquisa com Seres Humanos da Universidade Federal de Sao Joao Del-Rei, Campus Centro-Oeste Dona Lindu (UFSJ/CCO) sob o parecer 572.288. Foram coletados dados sociodemograficos, clinicos, antropometricos e bioquimicos. O processamento e a analise dos dados foram realizados por meio do programa Statistical Package for the Social Science®, versao 20.0. As variaveis foram descritas por meio de suas frequencias absolutas e relativas. Para a comparacao dos pacientes com e sem sindrome metabolica, foram utilizados os testes de Qui-Quadrado de Pearson e exato de Fischer. Na analise multivariada, para avaliar os fatores associados a SM, foi utilizado o modelo de regressao logistica binaria. Para a entrada das variaveis preditoras no modelo, foi considerado um valor-p menor que 0,20 na analise univariada. Utilizou-se o criterio forward para a entrada das variaveis no modelo e para a permanencia delas no modelo final foi adotado um nivel de 5% de significância. Apos ajuste do modelo final, foi avaliada a estimativa do OddsRatio ajustado com o respectivo intervalo de confianca de 95% (IC 95%). O ajuste do modelo foi avaliado por meio da estatistica de Hosmer& Lemeshow. Observou-se prevalencia de SM em 47,2% da amostra, com predominio entre as mulheres (58,8%). Pacientes com a sindrome apresentaram percentuais mais elevados de alteracoes, em todos os componentes. As razoes para essa elevada prevalencia ainda e muito controversa, principalmente em funcao da possivel participacao dos medicamentos antipsicoticos na genese das anormalidades metabolicas. A esquizofrenia, por si so, ja representa um fator de risco para as anormalidades que compoem a SM e, neste contexto, as medicacoes atipicas ou de segunda-geracao, estando entre elas a clozapina, possuem um papel importante na potencializacao do risco. A relacao precisa entre o uso de medicacoes antipsicoticas e o desenvolvimento de SM ainda permanece incerta, podendo-se afirmar, com clareza, que pessoas tratadas com esses medicamentos apresentam SM em uma frequencia superior a da populacao geral. A prevalencia de SM gira em torno de 4 a 26% nas pessoas que nao fazem uso desses medicamentos, chegando a 69% naqueles medicados. O uso de quatro ou mais medicamentos, sobrepeso e obesidade indicaram associacao significativa. Observa-se que a ingesta de varios medicamentos aumenta o risco para o aparecimento de efeitos adversos metabolicos, contribuindo, por conseguinte, para o desenvolvimento de SM. Um estudo que analisou o uso de mais de um psicotropico (politerapia), em comparacao a monoterapia, confirmou um risco aumentado para o desenvolvimento de alteracoes metabolicas e outras comorbidades. Deste modo, este achado deve ser visto com cuidado, considerando-se que pacientes que possuem esquizofrenia refrataria tendem a utilizar um numero maior de medicamentos em detrimento da gravidade da doenca e de sintomas diversos. Somando-se a isso, uma relacao causal mostra-se inviavel de ser estabelecida, tendo em vista a natureza deste estudo. Pacientes com a sindrome apresentaram um historico de menos internacoes psiquiatricas, comparados aqueles que nao a possuem , sendo associado a SM na analise multivariada. A prevalencia de SM foi elevada, considerando-se que esta taxa representa um valioso indicador de saude e aponta para a necessidade de cuidado e atencao. Sugere-se que esses pacientes sejam continuamente monitorados clinicamente, tanto no inicio do tratamento com clozapina quanto no seu decorrer, por meio de avaliacoes frequentes de seu peso, circunferencia da cintura e pressao arterial, bem como realizacao de exames bioquimicos quanto aos componentes de SM. Alem disso, indica-se que eles sejam incluidos em grupos e outras estrategias de educacao em saude e de qualidade de vida nas unidades de saude. Para isso, e necessario que esse grupo de pacientes seja visto como prioritario pelos gestores e profissionais de saude, considerando-se a necessidade de vigilância continua desses fatores de risco para o estabelecimento de intervencoes precoces e efetivas.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression, is a serious mental disorder and ranks first among psychiatric disorders that dominate the global disease burden. Recently, it was found that psilocybin, active compound derived from psychotropic mushrooms, can relieve depression symptoms rapidly and sustained benefits for several months. Beside MDD, psilocybin can alleviate symptoms of anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In the human body, psilocybin is dephosphorylated to form its active metabolite, psilocin which exhibits its effect through binding to various serotonin receptors. Is is considered relatively safe and can potentially meet the therapeutic needs without addictiveness and overdose risk. Although psilocybin has great potential in treating MDD and other psychological disorders, many studies so far lack homogeneity in their methodology, which limits conclusions. Further studies are needed in more extensive and diverse populations.",

      "abstract": "Context: During the 1950s and 1960s, anxiety was the emblematic mental health problem in the United States, and depression was considered to be a rare condition. One of the most puzzling phenomena regarding mental health treatment, research, and policy is why depression has become the central component of the stress tradition since then. Methods: This article reviews statistical trends in diagnosis, treatment, drug prescriptions, and textual readings of diagnostic criteria and secondary literature. Findings: The association of anxiety with diffuse and amorphous conceptions of \"stress\" and \"neuroses\" became incompatible with professional norms demanding diagnostic specificity. At the same time, the contrasting nosologies of anxiety and depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (DSM-III) extended major depressive disorder to encompass far more patients than any particular anxiety disorder. In addition, antidepressant drugs were not associated with the stigma and alleged side effects of the anxiolytic drugs. Conclusion: Various factors combined between the 1970s and the 1990s to transform conditions that had been viewed as \"anxiety\" into \"depression.\" New interests in the twenty-first century, however, might lead to the reemergence of anxiety as the signature mental health problem of American society.",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

      "abstract": "The disruption of psychosocial functioning (PSF) is currently listed as one of the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and PSF is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of successful treatment of the disease. Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Manic-depressive illness is recently named as a mood disorder according to the ICD-10 or DSM-III R diagnostic criteria. It consists of two opposite states, manic state and depressive state. Typical manic symptoms include a pathologic delightful mood, flight of ideas, heightened level of activity and sexual interest. Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness. Many rating scales, for instance Zung's SDS or HDSR, have been utilized as diagnostic aids. Rating scales and the symptomatology and diagnosis of manic-depressive illness are described in general.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

As a normal mood, depression is a common human reaction to a significant loss; as a medical term, it is also used to describe the sadness seen in patients who have other severe medical and psychiatric disorders. Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses. The first proposes that affective disorders result from functional changes in the central noradrenergic systems. The second postulates that the primary abnormality is in central serotonergic pathways. These two hypotheses are supported by the pharmacological effects of antidepressant drugs.",

      "title": "A PRISONER OF WAR SYNDROME: APATHY AS A REACTION TO SEVERE STRESS",
      "abstract": "We have pointed out that one defensive adjustment of POW's to stress is withdrawal. If the stresses are not too severe the person will withdraw physically if possible, or in any case will refuse to allow himself to become involved with the environment to as great an extent as possible. Certain kinds of overt behavior will be inhibited and most emotional responses will be suppressed. If the environment is severely stressful and physically depriving as well, the individual may regress into a more complete withdrawal and adopt a maladaptive state of dependency in which he ceases to take care of himself even to the point of death. We have labelled this type of defense \"apathy\" and distinguish it from states like catatonic stupor, or depression. \"Apathy\" appears not to be a single absolute reaction, but a syndrome which can vary markedly in degree. One major symptom in the syndrome is reduced or modulated affect, but only in extreme cases can one speak of true apathy or affectlessness. Other symptoms are listlessness, uncommunicativeness, lack of spontaneity, indifference, slowed reactions, lack of enthusiasm, and lack of initiative. It is important to note that underlying the overt lack of emotional spontaneity may lie great quantities of pent-up feelings, and that these will continue to be a problem to the individual when he is no longer in the environment that produced the \"apathy syndrome.\" The apathy syndrome serves to maintain personality integration in the face of severe reality and psychological stresses.",

      "abstract": "Unmada (a broad term which denotes various psychiatric problems under one umbrella) is a major psychiatric illness described in all Ayurvedic classics which is characterized by deranged mental functions. The etymological meaning of Unmada is \"a state of disturbed mental functions.\" Kaphaja Unmada is one among the five types of Unmada, which is caused by the aggravation of Kapha dosha. The description of Kaphaja Unmada is available in all classical texts of Ayurveda along with its symptomatology. Previous works have correlated \"Kaphaja Unmada\" with \"depressive disorder\"/\"depression\"/\"major depressive disorder.\" The symptomatology of Kaphaja Unmada and depressive disorder is 70% similar, but some of the signs and symptoms of Kaphaja Unmada such as laala sighanaka sravanam, swapna nityata, svayathuranane, shukla stimita malopadigdha akshata, naari priyata, chhardi, balam cha bhukte, ushnasevi, nakhadi shauklyam, kasa, and raatrau bhrisham are not seen in depressive disorders and they denote hypersomnia, puffiness of face, pernicious or megaloblastic anemia, hypersexual behavior, vomiting, nocturnal and postprandial aggravation, cold intolerance, depression, and dementia conditions which are due to the underlying hypothyroidism instead of depression only. These signs and symptoms can be explained in a better way when Kaphaja Unmada is compared with myxedema/hypothyroidism with depression. The present study considers that Kaphaja Unmada is more similar with hypothyroidism with depression/myxedema madness/myxedema psychosis than primary depression/typical depression alone.",

The meaning of the symptom is essential: it may reveal a crisis related to his developmental phase, antecedent infantile disease or the offset of adult disease. Secondly, at this age, the prescription of drugs rises questions about pharmacokinetics, possible side-effects, expected therapeutic effects and the way the prescription is experienced psychologically. Neuroleptics, which may be necessary in spite of their side-effects, should be restricted to psychotic conditions. Antidepressants, lithium, tranquilizers are also discussed with respect to their usefulness, risks and indications. But the meaning of any prescription is dependent upon the therapeutic relationship, and this is even more so for adolescents with whom careful listening is essential.",

      "title": "Are we compulsively chasing rainbows?",
      "abstract": "Addiction is commonly defined as a chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by taking drugs in excess, compulsive drug seeking, and continued use despite harmful consequences (NIDA, SAMSHA) despite the fact that the word \"compulsive\" is not explicitly stated in the DSM-or ICD-based diagnostic classification of substance use disorders (SUD), and that the role of compulsivity in addiction remains highly debated [1].Similarly, in the preclinical addiction field, the idea that the only way to identify an individual with addictionlike behaviors is to measure compulsive drug use/drug seeking is pervasive and often treated as the only approach for studying neuropharmacological mechanisms relevant to addiction.Recently, the addiction neuroscience field has moved from recognizing that \"compulsive drug seeking/use\" and \"continued seeking/use despite negative consequences\" are two distinct aspects of addiction to defining the former nearly exclusively by the latter [2-7].In our opinion, this informal but pervasive re-definition of compulsion has sacrificed construct validity for operationalization, and a direct consequence of this re-definition is that continued drug use (or seeking) despite punishment (e.g., painful footshock or bitter tastants) is widely considered the behavioral hallmark for compulsive-like drug-seeking behavior in preclinical models.We believe that over-reliance of addiction neuroscientists (including ourselves) on this measure hinges more on experimental convenience (i.e., testability) than on construct validity, and we also believe that over-reliance on this approach may be detrimental to the field.Here, we highlight several issues associated with the definition of compulsivity in addiction, problems associated with the regard for compulsivity as the defining feature of addiction, and the existence of conceptual and methodological limitations in preclinical studies.We also suggest ways for the field to move forward from the current position.Note that 'drug' in this commentary is a generic term that refers to alcohol, nicotine, and tobacco products, and illicit drugs.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

Psychotherapeutic treatments embody individual, group, or family and matrimonial psychotherapy; psychotherapy techniques (such as relaxation coaching or exposure therapy); and psychotherapy. Most studies recommend that for major psychological state disorders, a treatment approach involving each medication and psychotherapy is more practical than either treatment technique used alone. The psychotherapeutic drug trade continues to go through a quad of problems that square measure directly or indirectly poignant competition. Some hurdles recently faced by competitors during this market embody advertising restrictions, label changes, and a few general negative views regarding psychological state treatments.

Over 100,000 American veterans of Desert Storm/Shield (approximately 15% of deployed U. S.

These symptoms are not localized to any one organ, and the signs and symptoms and routine laboratory test results are not consistent with a single, specific disease (1). The signs and symptoms of GWI have been reported by 27/28 of the Coalition Armed Forces that were deployed against Iraqi units in Kuwait and Southern Iraq. The only exception is France. This brief review will summarize some of the possible exposures that occurred, the types of illnesses that resulted from these exposures, and some of the treatments that have been used on GWI patients.

      "abstract": "Summary There is both pharmacological and clinical support for a classification of the schizophrenic syndrome into negative and positive subtypes. For neuroleptics that act upon both types of symptoms, it appears that lower doses are required for treatment of negative than for positive symptoms. Successful drug treatment of negative symptoms may therefore depend upon the choice of a correct dosage for the individual patient. Due to variation in pharamacokinetic parameters, similar doses of a neuroleptic drug may result in different plasma levels in individual patients, especially after oral medication. Pharmacokinetic variations, if not under proper control, may easily disguise a concentration-dependent relationship, such as the effects of a neuroleptic drug upon negative and positive symptoms. In drug treatment of negative symptoms it may therefore be an advantage to individualize the doses as a function of plasma drug level measurements, when available. No general relationship has been demonstrated between the chemical properties or pharmacodynamics of neuroleptic drugs and their potential to act upon negative symptoms. Also, the drugs which have been demonstrated to have an “energizing” effect have widely different pharmacokinetic properties. A chemical or pharmacological classification of neuroleptics therefore does not seem to give any information about their possible efficacy in treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Cannabis-Based Medicines and Medical Cannabis for Chronic Neuropathic Pain",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain represents a broad category of pain syndromes that include a wide variety of peripheral and central disorders. The overall prevalence of neuropathic pain in the general population is reported to be between 7 and 10%. Management of neuropathic pain presents an unmet clinical need, with less than 50% of patients achieving substantial pain relief with medications currently recommended such as pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine and various tricyclic antidepressants. It has been suggested that cannabis-based medicines (CbMs) and medical cannabis (MC) may be a treatment option for those with chronic neuropathic pain. CbMs/MC are available in different forms: licensed medications or medical products (plant-derived and/or synthetic products such as tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol); magistral preparations of cannabis plant derivatives with defined molecular content such as dronabinol (tetrahydrocannabinol); and herbal cannabis with a defined content of tetrahydrocannabinol and/or cannabidiol, together with other active ingredients (phytocannabinoids other than cannabidiol/tetrahydrocannabinol, terpenes and flavonoids). The availability of different types of CbMs/MC varies between countries worldwide. Systematic reviews of available randomised controlled trials have stated low-quality evidence for CbMs and MC for chronic neuropathic pain. Depending on the studies included in the various quantitative syntheses, authors have reached divergent conclusions on the efficacy of CbMs/MC for chronic neuropathic pain (from not effective to a clinically meaningful benefit). Clinically relevant side effects of CbMs/MC, especially for central nervous system and psychiatric disorders, have been reported by some systematic reviews. Recommendations for the use of CbMs/MC for chronic neuropathic pain by various medical associations also differ, from negative recommendations, no recommendation possible, recommended as third-line therapy, or recommended as an alternative in selected cases failing standard therapies within a multimodal concept. After reading this paper, readers are invited to formulate their own conclusions regarding the potential benefits and harms of CbMs/MC for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

In recent years there has been a move to consider and classify patients with less severe forms of cognitive impairment—so-called mild cognitive impairment—and non-memory presentations, with the latest DSM-V criteria identifying individuals with major or minor neurocognitive syndromes. Ongoing research using biomarkers suggest that there is a long presymptomatic phase for many causes of dementia.",

      "abstract": "ZusammenfassungRückenschmerzen sind neben Kopfschmerzen die häufigsten Schmerzprobleme, die aufgrund von rnedizinischen, sozialen und psychischen Faktoren zu einer Langzeitbehinderung führen, Nach heutiger Erkenntnis werden die gravierendsten Kosten in überwiegendem Ausmaße nicht durch spezifische Rückenschmerzprobleme verursacht, sondern durch den sogenannten nichtspezifischen Rückenschmerz. Als solcher wird Rückenschmerz definiert, der ohne identifizierbare anatomische und/oder neurophysiologische Faktoren auftritt. Davon abzugrenzen sind Rückenschmerzen bei Irritationen der Nervenwurzeln und anderen spinalen neurologischen Prozessen wie beispielsweise Tumorleiden oder entzündliche Prozesse. Als spezifische Rückenschmerzursachen können Faktoren identifiziert werden, wie Bandscheibenherniation, Spondylolisthesis, Spinalstenosen, Instabilität der Wirbelsäule, Wirbelfrakturen, Wirbeltumore, Infektionen oder entzündliche Erkrankungen. Patienten mit einer neurologisch identifizierbaren Lumboischialgie mit klarer radikulärer Ausbreitung gehören zur Gruppe der Patienten mit spezifischen Rückenschmerzen. Gemäß aktueller epidemiologischer Daten sind jedoch nur maximal 150/0 der Patienten mit Rückenschmerzen in diese bekannten spezifischen Ursachengruppen einzuordnen, der übergroße Teil von rund 850/0 der Rückenschmerzpatienten leidet an unspezifischen Rückenschmerzen.",

      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of drug and substance abuse has become a contemporary social problem among youth. Alarmingly, large number of youth in Nigeria becomes involved up to the extent of some of them becoming dependents thereby affecting their quality of life. Understanding the nature of this phenomenon is related to operationalizing basic concepts such as use, misuse and abuse. The boundaries that separate these concepts have remained ambiguous and debatable, varying from drug/substance to drug/substance, user to user. Given the broad typology and varied nature of what is consumed and abused today, some of the drugs/substances put users to sleep while some wake them up. They are typically grouped as – depressants, hallucinogens, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, sedatives, stimulants, synthetic drugs, solvents/inhalants and tranquilizers. The reasons for abusing drugs/substances and the implications are so complex involving many issues, some of which are situated around the individual; external to the individual or are situated within the society or the environment. There is no single theory of drug/substance abuse, the propositions of scholars in respect of socio-psychological, trait, bio-social, learning, availability, relative deprivation, social disorganization, gateway/stepping-stone, strain and anomie theories are instructive. No society has been spared from the devastating havoc caused by drug/substance abuse especially the implications on socio-economic and political development. The adverse consequences could be social, economic, political, physical, psychological, medical and physiological, affecting users, immediate families and the society. Government, communities, using educators, should continue with the efforts on raising awareness about drugs/substances and their effects.",

      "abstract": "While schizophrenia-like psychosis is known to occur with chronic alcoholism the nosological differentiation of schizophrenia-like psychosis in patients with drug abuse remains difficult. An increased risk for the development of such psychoses has been discussed for various substances, e.g. cannabis. On the one hand this is supported by clinical and epidemiological studies but a final agreement has not been reached. On the other hand high prevalence estimates for substance abuse in schizophrenics have been reported in the angloamerican literature. Prevalence estimates for drug abuse and dependence range between 7-65% and a comparatively distinct abuse pattern in schizophrenics has been discerned: Apart from alcohol schizophrenics tend to abuse cannabis and psychostimulants including cocaine and hallucinogenes, whereas narcotics are abused only infrequently. Whether these recent figures for substance abuse and dependence are due to a real increase (32) or to improved diagnostic instruments and differences in the classification of psychiatric disorders or to selected samples (3, 122) is still a matter of controversy. In comparison with other schizophrenics dual diagnosis schizophrenics show more positive (psychotic) and less negative symptoms. In this review some clinical and neuro-biological problems concerning the concept of drug-induced psychosis and basic principles of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in schizophrenic patients with substance abuse are discussed.",

She had a one-month history of altered behavioral and presented paranoid delusional though. Hallucinations were excluded. A detailed clinical evaluation excluded dementia, late-onset chronic psychosis and primary mood disorders with psychotic symptoms and revealed that symptoms initiate few days after the introduction of metformin to treat her diabetes. After Metformin suspension, total remission of psychotic symptoms was obtained in one week and patient return to previous functionality. Psychosis secondary to metformin use is a very rare complication of oral antidiabetic drugs use but the awareness of this condition can lead to an earlier recognition and diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "In patients with consequences of a stroke, disturbances in motor, cognitive, and sensory functions are observed; cardiovascular, endocrine and other body systems, impairment of self-care and independent walking. Physical dependence, the inability to self-care in fulfilling urgent biological needs leads to a feeling of helplessness and is accompanied by depressive, neurotic reactions to the disease. Restoration of impaired functions after a stroke has a long period and the success of recovery depends, on the one hand, on the volume and location of the brain lesion, the severity of motor and cognitive impairments, on the other hand, on the position of the patient himself, the attitude of the patient’s personality to the disease and adherence to treatment. A patient’s stay in a hospital is associated with the social expectations of the staff for certain behavior of the patient: fulfilling the instructions of the attending physician, partnership with staff (physical therapy methodologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, etc.), the patient’s activity, the formation of healthy lifestyle attitudes (giving up smoking, alcohol, fatty food, etc.), which can be called psychological conditions for rehabilitation. However, not all patients are ready to fulfill these rehabilitation conditions, which are targets for psychological correction. The tasks of psychological assistance should be focused on developing adherence to treatment, forming cooperative relationships with staff, and healthy lifestyle attitudes, which can contribute to restorative treatment and the prevention of recurrent stroke. Psychological assistance during individual and group work should be focused on providing emotional support, setting realistic and understandable goals for the patient, adequate to the patient’s capabilities, both in a hospital and clinic, which can ensure his active inclusion in the treatment process.",

      "abstract": "Community abuse of prescription medication is typically limited to overuse or inappropriate sharing of medication. In jails and prisons, the demand characteristics are dramatically altered, creating an elaborate laboratory for medication alteration, diversion, and abuse. While prescription medications are sometimes used to achieve a ‘high,’ they may also be sought to ease discomforts commonly experienced in a jail or prison. Some may seek stimulating medications to counteract the effects of prescribed sedatives to allow them to be ready to respond to real or perceived dangers. Thus, inmates may feign or exaggerate mood, anxiety, psychotic, or somatic symptoms with the goal of being prescribed medications with the desired effects. More insidious is the diversion of prescribed medications to a third party. Many prescribed medicines have a ‘street value’ in correctional settings. A patient with a legitimate need for medication, who may already have poor illness insight, may be enticed or coerced into transferring their medication to a peer. This creates several dangerous problems. The source inmate may worsen or fail to improve, which may lead to dose escalation, an incorrect conclusion about a treatment failure, poor functioning, and behavioral sequelae including disruptive or violent conduct. Meanwhile, the recipient is exposed to medication risks without the benefits of informed consent or medical supervision. This chapter presents data on specific classes of prescribed medication abuses, methods of abuse, and approaches to minimize abuse or diversion of prescribed medications.",

ECT is considered a low risk procedure and most commonly experienced side effects are minor in nature. Many of these side effects can be relieved by reassurance and over-the-counter medications. The minor side effects may include headache, muscle pain, nausea rarely associated with vomiting, confusion and post treatment agitation. Memory disturbance is usually limited to impaired short term memory during the treatment course and for a few weeks following the completion of the course. Adolescents who have been evaluated months or years following ECT do not differ significantly from those who did not receive this treatment. Prolonged seizures may be somewhat commoner in adolescents than in adults and may be prevented and treated by appropriate steps. No fatalities, which could be directly attributed to ECT, have been ever reported in this age group.",

      "title": "Emotional injury OCD - overlooked and misidentified",
      "abstract": "Obsessions of physically harming others are common in OCD. Current inventories largely do not include obsessions of emotionally injuring others, of diminishing another’s perceived value or worth. This may reflect a low prevalence rate or specific barriers to identification. Hypothesized barriers to clinical identification of emotional injury OCD include the atypically pleasant presentation of characteristic affirming compulsions. Patient self-identification is hypothesized to be diminished by the nature of overt and mental compulsions; for instance, agreeing with others and self-criticism. Recommendations are provided for differential diagnoses with social anxiety and codependency, as well as specific contraindications for common psychotherapeutic approaches. Hypothesized comorbid pathology are presented as opportunities for initial identification of cases. In establishing an a priori conceptual framework, this overlooked and misidentified OCD subtype can better be assessed, researched, and effectively treated.",

      "title": "A Behaviorist Perspective",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a sensory experience that produces suffering and functional impairment and is the result of both sensory input as well as secondary adaptation of the nervous system. The sensitization of the nervous system to pain is influenced by physical activity (or inactivity) and medication exposure. Medication taking and physical activity are behaviors that are increased or decreased by positive and negative reinforcement. Patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions at presentation, including addictions, mood disorders, personality vulnerabilities and life circumstances that amplify their disability and impede their recovery. Behavioral conditioning contributes to chronic pain disorders in the form of both classical (Pavlov) and operant (Skinner) conditioning that increases the experience of pain, the liability to ongoing injury, the central amplification of pain, the use of reinforcing medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and behaviors associated with disability. The term 'abnormal illness behavior' has been used to describe behaviors that are associated with illness but are not explained physiologically. Behavioral conditioning often amplifies these abnormal behaviors in patients with chronic pain. Addiction can also be seen as a behavior that is reinforced and conditioned. The same factors that amplify abnormal illness behaviors also increase the liability to addiction. Psychiatric comorbidities also complicate and amplify abnormal illness behaviors and addictive behaviors and further contribute to the disability of chronic pain patients. Model interventions that reinforce healthy behaviors and extinguish illness behaviors are effective in patients with addictions and chronic pain. Maladaptive behaviors including addictive behaviors can be used as targets for classical and operant conditioning techniques, and these techniques are demonstrably effective in patients with chronic pain and addictions.",

Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

      "abstract": "Currently detoxification of drug and alcohol dependent patients is pharmacologically unresolved, and long-term treatment following the acute phase is also not very successful including a high number of relapses. We would need medications that on the short term cease: the severe vegetative symptoms, the pain, the extremely distressing psychosyndrome characterised by restlessness, anxiety or acute depressive symptoms, and the craving. The optimal would be if there was one medication capable of simultaneously alleviating or diminishing all the above symptoms without causing dependency and preventing relapse in the long-term. Dependency is almost all cases accompanied by primary and/or secondary mood disorder or sleep disorder which should also be treated. It should be considered, however, that following withdrawal of the agent benzodiazepine dependency often develops. The serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) trazodone is effective in the treatment of depression accompanied by sleeping disorder and it has also shown efficacy in alcohol and benzodiazepine-dependency. Its administration may improve the efficacy of detoxification and treatment of following conditions, may decrease medication load and the risk of the development of benzodiazepine dependency. In our clinical practice we frequently use this agent to treat our patients simultaneously suffering from depression and addiction problems, gaining experience comparing it to other pharmacotherapies (benzodiazepines or other antidepressants). The medication is not approved for alcohol and drug dependence, however, treatment t of comorbid conditions is not against to the official recommendations. Our aim was, in addition to reviewing the literature, to share our experience which, although cannot be considered an evidence based study, we deemed worthy of publishing. We cannot, at this point, put forward a protocol addressing all related scientific problems and problems of off-label treatment, and we could not so far treat enough patients with trazodone so that our results would be statistically proven. \"Acute\" and long term treatment of dependency is not sufficiently effective with a substantial relapse rate, which is in part related to the lack of specific medication also for long term treatment. Among the available psychopharmacons, trazodone is a possible choice, since, as based on patients' reports and clinical observations, improvement of their depressive conditions and sleep problems potentially decreases the risk of relapse of drug and alcohol dependence.",

The disorder has received attention from a wide range of clinicians and researchers. The mechanism of causation of this disorder has been poorly understood, though biological, psychological and social factors seem to play a role. The disorder causes significant impairment and is highly comorbid with other disorders. Non-pharmacological measures like graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy seem to work better for treatment than pharmacological measures.

This article reviews the clinical effects and treatment of persons who use cocaine, methamphetamines, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), synthetic cannabinoids, and synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\"). Cocaine blocks the reuptake of the monoamine transporters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Immediate clinical effects include increased energy and euphoria, as well as hypertension and arrhythmias. Acute myocardial infarction, seizures, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and movement disorders are among the possible adverse effects. Like cocaine, methamphetamine blocks reuptake of monoamine transporters, but also stimulates dopamine release and has a longer duration of action. Methamphetamine misuse is associated with severe dental problems. MDMA is a stimulant and psychedelic with a chemical structure similar to serotonin. Adverse effects include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, long-term memory impairment, and mood disorders. Synthetic cannabinoids can have a more intense and long-lasting effect than natural cannabis. Acute intoxication may cause severe cardiac and respiratory complications and seizures. Synthetic cathinones are marketed as cheap substitutes for other stimulants. Their effects are similar to those of other stimulants, and they are addictive. Psychosocial intervention is the main form of treatment for addiction to these substances. Promising therapies include disulfiram and substitution therapy for cocaine misuse disorders, and mirtazapine for methamphetamine use disorder.",

Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders. Comorbid psychopathology, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors/obsessive-compulsive disorder, affects the majority of patients and is correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist. The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life; the relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood. This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, current understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The modern era of psychiatric drug treatment began with the introduction of chlorpromazine into the chaotic mental hospital setting in the 1950s as a new psychotropic agent for controlling excitement, agitation, and aggressivity. In that setting the urgency of management problems operated to shrink the complexity of the patient as a psychosocial being down to specific symptoms targeted for chemical subjugation. From this beginning - a chemically produced quieting or tranquillisation - there emerged a revitalised psychiatric movement to expand the strictly medical understanding and treatment of psychological disturbance that acknowledges no limits. This state of affairs has achieved a position of dominance and respect in the mental health industry, based upon social forces operating within psychiatry as a profession and outside of psychiatry in the larger political-economic realm. The catastrophe of widespread and expanding medically-produced disease has failed to alarm psychiatry into taking stock of the determinants of the catastrophe - indeed the existence and magnitude of the tragedy is barely recognised within psychiatry. This conclusion is illustrated by detailed examination of the psychopharmacologic agents alprazolam (Xanax) and fluoxetine (Prozac).",

The more contrasted treatment guidelines are adapted in accordance with the severity of the case. In addition, the set guidelines are given which are also utilised and published, but by less reliable authors. Chlormethiazole, tetrabamate and the benzodiazepines are the most used drugs and the ones on which more data exists on efficacy and safety but details are given of certain studies with other drugs such as carbamazephine and other anticonvulsivants, the beta-blockers, the alpha2 antagonists, the calcium antagonists and others. Lastly, therapeutic recommendations are given for special cases such as delirium tremens, convulsions during abstinence, cases of pregnant women, the old or the post operational patient.",

A high proportion of patients will have been or will be addicted to drugs. Complicating the anesthetic plan are the acute and chronic impact of drug use on the patient. Acute intoxication can potentiate anesthetics, leading to overdose. Chronic drug abuse can cause end-organ damage and tolerance to anesthetics and require modification of the anesthetic plan. Further complicating the anesthetic plan are the drugs used in medication assistance treatment programs for patients with addiction.

      "abstract": "One of the reasons why drug misuse is managed substantially as a psychiatric specialty is that it is strongly associated with various pervasive and clinically important psychiatric conditions. Studies have examined the relationship both ways round – that is, investigating rates of mental disorders in drug misusers, or the extent of drug misuse in mentally ill populations, and some of these are discussed here. In practice, clinicians must be skilled in recognizing personality disorder (often as a continuation of adolescent conduct disorder), depression, and anxiety states, all of which are extremely common and need to be distinguished from the effects of drug misuse itself. Personality disorder is particularly important, as it is often the main cause of abnormal mood in drug misusers and it exerts strong negative effects on many forms of treatment; the first part of the chapter focuses on this and the difficult area of drug-induced psychosis. The rest of the chapter is then given over to a discussion from the other perspective, of substance misuse problems in those with severe mental illness, as the rising rates of such problems are currently posing great difficulties in the provision of general psychiatric treatment in the community.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of epilepsy is always a s0.urce of sh?ck to the family and is frequently accompamed by anXIety concerning the cause. In extreme cases the diagnosis can even lead to suicide. Parents feel guilty and search for reasons why this has happened to one of their children. Is it attributable to some defect in their family, such as an alcoholic uncle or a mentally disturbed relative, or to their own misdeeds? The mother may blame herself for trying to avoid pregnancy, or for an attempted termination, or just not wanting the child. Arising from these deeply-felt feelings and anxieties the child may be rejected or overprotected. . The child who has epilepsy will have to grow up ID an atmosphere of anxiety about his condition. Parents are concerned about their responsibility and how far they can allow the child to follow a normal existence. There may be disputes about this, and as to how far the child should be subject to the same discipline as the other children. The child may endure many restrictions (swimming, riding a bicycle, etc), limitations on activities or going out with other children. Drugs may have to be taken-a nuisance in itself-and he will suffer the effects of taking drugs even if these are minimal. There may be difficulty in keeping up with schooling, and in many ways he will feel different from other children. Later the inability to drive a car may be a social handicap. Epilepsy, to the individual, means a ~reat deal ~f uncertainty. Will a seizure interfere with taking an exan:nnation or an interview for a job, or plans for some social activity or a holiday? Epileptics may feel that the risk. of causing a disturbance at a cinema or a dance by havIDg a seizure is too embarrassing, and so they become more and more isolated. All these factors play a significant role in the development of the individual and his per~onality. There is no clear evidence that epilepsy itself causes behavioural disturbance. Occasionally the underlying cause of the seizure may be responsible for disturbed behaviour in a child or some cases of temporal lobe epilepsy cause behavioural disorders. The extremes of epileptic personalitv are more often the sort of behaviour which follows lo~g periods of institutional care and it is r~re ~o find someone demonstrating the old textbook epileptic personality outside of an institution.

Although insight has been studied specifically in schizophrenia and its study in mood disorders has traditionally received limited attention, the evaluation of this concept in mood disorders is also very important because of the impact on treatment compliance and outcome. In bipolar disorder (BD), clinical insight varies substantially over time. Most researchers observed that insight is more impaired during an illness episode than during remission, in mixed than in pure manic episodes, in bipolar II than in bipolar I patients, and in pure mania than in bipolar or unipolar depression. Lack of insight is a consistent factor of non-adherence to medication in bipolar patients, along with severity of BD, side effects of medication, effectiveness, and patient-related factors. Also, impaired insight into treatment and a great number of previous hospitalizations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes (psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, violent or suicidal behavior) among the patients with bipolar I disorder. In the management of bipolar disorder, improving quality of life (QoL) and outcome should be one the most important goals.",

      "abstract": "The concept ``psychosomatic'', initially introduced in the first half of this century, has recently being reconfirmed by the theory and practice of modern medicine. The psychosomatic disorders are generally defined as physical (somatic) diseases produced, in part, by psychological factors, primarily stress. The organs of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and endocrine system are being affected, as a result of innervation by the autonomic nervous system. In some of these diseases the psychological factors can play relatively essential role; these are named ``primary psychosomatic diseases'': essential hypertension, peptic ulcer, bronchial asthma, ulcerative colitis, neurodermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and hyperthyroidism (the last two diseases were later replaced by eating disorders as bulimia and anorexia nervosa). In many other cases the psychological element is only one among several parallel factors; these are sometimes called ``secondary psychosomatic diseases''. As known from the psychosomatic medicine, the stressors are being refracted through the individual history of a person as through a prism, leading to a spectrum of possible reactions. The personality prism comprises heredity, early child experiences and actual conflict, while the resulting disorders, as a response of the human being, have the form of neuroses, disturbed behavior and psychoses from one side, and psychophysiological disorders and othermore » psychosomatic diseases, including synergetic amplification, from the other side.

      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "title": "Tinjauan hukum pidana Islam terhadap pasal 59 ayat (2) uu nomor 5 tahun 1997 tentang psikotropika: studi analisis pidana mati bagi pengedar psikotropika golongan I",
      "abstract": "Penyalahgunaan narkotika saat ini termasuk salah satu tindak pidana yang paling banyak terjadi di antaranya penyalahgunaan psikotropika. Psikotropika merupakan obat atau bahan yang bermanfaat di bidang pengobatan atau pelayanan kesehatan dan pengembangan ilmu pengetahuan, dan di sisi lain, dapat menimbulkan ketergantungan yang sangat merugikan apabila dipergunakan tanpa pengendalian dan pengawasan yang ketat dan seksama. Perkembangan penyalahgunaan psikotropika dalam kenyataan semakin meningkat, mendorong Pemerintah Indonesia menerbitkan Undang-Undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1997 tentang Psikotropika.\r\nPsikotropika Golongan I mempunyai potensi amat kuat yang berakibat pada sindrom ketergantungan. Psikotropika golongan I hanya diperuntukkan untuk penelitian dan ilmu pengetahuan. Penyalahgunaan psikotropika golongan I sangat membahayakan jiwa dan raga dari pengkonsumsinya. Psikotropika golongan I dapat mengakibatkan gangguan terhadap kesehatan fisik, keracunan, dan gejala putus obat, psikotropika juga menimbulkan gangguan psikis pada penggunanya. Antara lain gelisah, cemas, takut, curiga, paranoid, mudah panik, disorientasi, bingung, fotofobia, mudah tersinggung, depresi, halusinasi visual, euphoria, agresif, ganggan daya ingat, gangguan nalar, banyak bicara, gangguan kesadaran, kognitif, afektif, persepsi, dan perilaku.\r\nTindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika dan Psikotropika dapat menghancurkan masa depan suatu bangsa dengan membunuh secara perlahan tapi pasti seluruh potensi dan aset berharga sebuah bangsa. Mulai dari generasi muda, kinerja manusia, dana negara untuk penyediaan obat dan pemeliharaan korban, biaya sosial ekonomi akibat penyalahgunaan dan peredaran gelap narkotika dan psikotropika. \r\nTindak pidana penyalahgunaan psikotropika golongan I seperti tindak pidana produksi, pengimporan, dan pengedaran psikotropika golongan I yang dilakukan secara ilegal dan terorganisir dengan tujuan agar psikotropika golongan I tersebut disalahgunakan, pelakunya dapat dihukum dengan hukuman mati. Karena sangat besar akibat dan bahaya yang ditimbulkan bagi jiwa pemakai psikotropika, bagi keluarga, masyarakat sekitar, dan bagi bangsa Indonesia, maka hukuman mati harus tetap ditetapkan bagi pengedar psikotropika golongan I. Penghapusan hukuman mati justru akan mengundang pengedar-pengedar dari Negara lain masuk ke Indonesia.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy of Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is chiefly characterized by a cognitive focus on threats and risks towards the individual and/or the immediate family. It is accompanied by a sense of tension, worry, muscle pain, disturbed sleep and irritability. The condition impairs work capacity, relations, and leisure activities, and aggravates concurrent somatic diseases. Due to its chronic course, GAD increases costs for the individual, the family, and health care services, and reduces work and educational performance. In cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes and neurological diseases, GAD is a risk factor for somatic complications and for lowered adherence to somatic treatments. There is evidence that GAD can be treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and/or with medications. First-line pharmacotherapies are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and pregabalin. If such therapies fail, one may reconsider the diagnosis, question adherence with the prescribed schedule, and determine the adverse influence of comorbidity (such as depression, substance use, and physical ill-health) as well as the influence of social stressors. Second-line pharmacotherapies are largely not supported by controlled trials, and so leave much to clinical judgment and careful monitoring. One may attempt treatments with benzodiazepine anxiolytics, with quetiapine, or with pregabalin as an adjunct therapy in patients with partial response to SSRI or SNRI treatment. CBT is a valid alternative to pharmacotherapy, depending on patient preference.",

      "title": "The assessment and management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia in perspective",
      "abstract": "Consensus was reached on the five following points: (1) \"Treatment resistance\" is a term which is widely used, but not adequately defined. In particular, definitions of \"responders\" and \"non-responders\" need to be more precise. (2) There is a need to extend the assessment of the results of treatment to include factors such as quality of life and the subjective evaluation by the patient and relatives. (3) Clozapine (Clozaril((R))/Leponex((R))) has become the standard for atypical antipsychotic drugs. The adjective \"atypical\" is not an exact descriptor. The vague nature of the term leads to confusion with other drugs that are putative atypical antipsychotic agents but have different properties. D(2) dopamine receptor antagonism is the single factor common to all antipsychotic drugs. Antagonism at a specific D(2)-like receptor may underlie the atypical antipsychotic actions of clozapine. Drugs described as being atypical antipsychotics share a relatively low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. (4) Clozapine is the only drug that produces antipsychotic (therapeutic) effects at doses that do not result, in significant extrapyramidal side effects. This may be due to the fact that antipsychotic efficacy is obtained with clozapine in doses that result in significantly less striatal D(2) occupancy. Other factors including concomitant 5-HT(2) antagonism, may contribute to the lack of motor side effects observed with clozapine treatment. (5) Clozapine is the only drug currently well proven in therapy-resistant schizophrenia, and there is a case for its earlier use in patients who can be anticipated to become therapy resistant. Other antipsychotic therapies remain unproven in this group of patients.",

Volatile substances are ubiquitous. The practice of inhalation to produce euphoria can be traced to the ancient Greeks. The disorders discussed in the chapter are classified under the inhalant-related disorders section of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM) -5 and are subdivided into four groups: inhalant use disorder, inhalant intoxication, other inhalant-induced disorders, and unspecified inhalant-related disorder. Exposure to organic solvents during inhalant abuse occurs at levels several thousand times higher than in the occupational setting and results in numerous irreversible disease states. Some toxicity has been validated through animal studies; others have been only tentatively correlated with certain substances. Adolescents and adults with inhalant use disorders are among the most disadvantaged, comorbidly disordered, and challenging of all psychiatric patient subgroups.",

They include comorbid physical illnesses, social isolation, sensory deficits, cognitive changes, polypharmacy, and substance abuse. Agitation and aggressiveness are also associated with psychosis in the elderly and frequently are the precipitating reasons for psychiatric consultation. A review of psychoses in the elderly must, therefore, consider psychotic symptoms within the context of the underlying etiologies of the psychotic symptoms. Elderly patients who present with psychotic symptoms require social, behavioral, and environmental interventions that are necessary for their safety and orientation. Given the likelihood of comorbid medical disorders and concomitant medications, the mere presence of delusions or hallucinations is not always an indication for additional medications. However, some patients may need pharmacologic intervention in order to manage the behavioral disturbance that often results from the psychotic symptoms. The atypical antipsychotics with their low propensity to produce extrapyramidal and cognitive side effects have greatly advanced the pharmacotherapy for elderly patients with psychoses.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that some drugs and neurodegenerative processes, such asParkinson’s disease, can cause extrapyramidal side effects (1). Extrapyramidal symptoms (ES) may be drug-induced and due affect tolerance and compliance (2). ES includes akathisia, parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. tremor, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity) and impaired involuntary movements (e.g. acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia) (3). Especially, antipsychotic drugs therapy (4), antiemetics, and a variety of other drugs (5) can frequently cause severe occurrences and complications (4). Some drugs induced ES are thought to causean imbalance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal pathway(1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine and doxepine, may have antidopaminergic effect(2). However, antidepressant drugs are not directly acting as dopamine antagonists(6), but some movement disorders symptoms are rarely described as a side effect of tricyclic antidepressants(2). Enuresis nocturna is a multidisciplinary problem worked on by such many physicians as pediatricians, urologists and child and adolescent psychiatrists (7) can cause a significant psychosocial problem for children and their parents (8), which is estimated at 3.8% to 25% (9). That is, there are over 50 million children with enuresis around the world (10). Theaetiology of this condition is not totally known. Medical therapies including imipramine, desmopressin and anticholinergics, behavioural therapy and enuretic alarm devices are proposed to manage this condition(8). TCAs drugs are widely used in the process of managing this condition (11), for instance, Imipramine can reduce wetting in some children and young people (12).Unsal et al. Here we report a case of imipramine induced acute dystonia in an enuretic child. 8- year-old boy with severe torticollis was assessed in our outpatient clinic and. Beforehand, he had been diagnosed as enuresis nocturna by a child psychiatrist and was given imipramine 10 mg/day for treatment. After three days initiating imipramine 10 mg/day, he had severe muscular spasm on his neck. He had no psychiatric and neurological history. Physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistries, blood counts were within normal limits. He wasonly taking imipramine, and no other medication had been used during this three days. He was diagnosed with imipramine induced dystonia and biperiden 5 mg was administered intramusculary. After 45 minutes, it was seen that torticollis was resolved and he was referred to child psychiatry for the treatment of enuresis nocturna.",

In dysphoric patients the drugs have a broad-spectrum effect, not only reducing phobias and rituals but also anxiety-depression, panic, anger, and hostility, all of which are highly intercorrelated, but none yet demonstrated to be the core disturbance. Phobics, but not obsessive-compulsives, have an unusually high dropout rate from treatment when drugs or placebo are given. When antidepressants are stopped, even after 6-8 months, relapse is likely. The drugs do not reduce the liability of many phobics and obsessive-compulsives to have dysphoric episodes over the years. Exposure treatments are not lastingly effective for phobias and for rituals, but do not reduce the liability to later dysphoric episodes.",

      "abstract": "Burnout or professional fatigue syndrome has never been more talked about than in recent times. It is the result of exposure to a situation in which the strategies of the subject who are supposed to manage the stresses of the environment become outdated and inoperative. An imbalance is created between the demands and the material, operational and psychological resources to cope with them. Many health professions are confronted with the challenge of managing burnout. Among them, the general practitioner is very often on the front line. This paper is dedicated to him in priority. In its first part, it deals successively with the classification of the pathology (ICD-10 and DSM-5), its prevalence, its socio-economic impacts, its clinical picture (three stages), its diagnosis (by clinic and questionnaires), its causes, its evolution (from denial to acceptance), and its long-term consequences in the absence of treatment.Le burnout ou syndrome de fatigue professionnelle n’a jamais autant fait parler de lui que ces derniers temps.

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

Depressive symptoms are a collection of behaviors and feelings that can be specifically classified as depression. Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders. The results showed that faith can be a factor that can improve the mental health of an individual.",

Exposure therapy, that is implemented as part of cognitive and behavioral psychotherapeutic approaches, has been found to be effective for treating specific phobias, compared to no treatment, placebo treatment, or alternative psychotherapeutic treatment. More research needs to take place however on specific phobias, which have been understudied compared to other anxiety disorders. At the same time, the outcomes of psychotherapy for specific phobias need to be examined longitudinally, so that the long-term effectiveness of therapy can be assessed. Finally, due to the fact that specific phobias are a heterogenous group of disorder, it is difficult to draw informed conclusions as to the effectiveness of various psychotherapeutic approaches for all specific phobias.",

Although it can be achieved by non-pharmacological measurements (sleeping, computer training, exercising), people often tend to reach for pharmacological solutions like OTC substances (coffee, energy drinks and Ginkgo biloba extract pills), and most recently, psychostimulant drugs (amphetamines, methylphenidat, modafinil) perscribed by doctors for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy, which are obtained illegaly from a „black market“. This kind of practice is usually associated with certain social groups like pupils and students with prevalence rates between 1 and 20%, depending on the design of study. Efficiency of pharmacological cognitive enhancement (PCE) also differs among individuals and appears to be the highest in those whose initial neurotransmiter (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin) concentrations are low. On the other hand, media, as well as public, sees „smart drugs“ as highly efficient and considers PCE to be cheating. Using drugs to inhance cognitive performance is a controversial subject that opens up many scientific and moral questions, which, for now, stay unaswered: should the use of „smart drugs“ be legalized and would legalization lead to social progress, what kind of health consequences (especially on young people) would PCE have, having in mind differences in efficiancy among individuals, how would it be determined in which individuals would the benefit of PCE be bigger than risks, which steps should be taken to educate the public etc. Further research about efficiancy and safety of use of drugs as cognitive enhancers is needed.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

The diagnostic criteria require the history of one or more depressive episodes in the absence of a history of mania. In contrast to adults, youth may experience predominantly irritable rather than sad mood. The assessment of depression should include a psychiatric evaluation, medical history, and focused laboratory studies to rule out medical and/or substance-related causes. The evaluation should also consider potential precipitants such as recent losses, interpersonal problems, or trauma. The patient should be asked directly about suicidal ideation, plans, and past attempts. Psychotherapy alone or in combination with antidepressant therapy is effective for the treatment of pediatric depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are the most well-studied psychotherapies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medication class and should be considered in moderate to severe cases of depression.",

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia afflicts millions of people in the United States. It is associated with decreased quality of life, accidents, several comorbid conditions, increased morbidity, and substantial direct and indirect costs. Chronic insomnia is a multifactorial and individualized disorder. Its etiology may be cognitive or physiologic in nature (or both), and is more often than not associated with a comorbid condition, complicating its recognition, evaluation, and treatment. Effective nonpharmacotherapeutic (cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia) and pharmacotherapeutic (hypnotic medications) treatment modalities are available. Treatment of chronic insomnia can make a significant improvement in quality of life, and may also be associated with an improvement in comorbid conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abuse of alcohol (ethanol) and abuse of an increasing number of drugs (e.g. analgesics and sedatives) are among the outstanding social and medical problems of many industrialized countries including Switzerland. Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the \"metabolic\" and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

      "abstract": "Unhealed trauma causes distress in the body. When the nature of the distress overrides a person's existing system for coping, or the trauma is not processed, survivors may numb themselves or seek a more pleasurable experience to escape. Such behavior is a completely natural response to unprocessed trauma. This book continues challenging the existing paradigms for treating addiction and related issues. Despite the longstanding existence of professional treatment in North America, recidivism is high. People are still dying at alarming rates not just from the opioid crisis that dominates news headlines, also from the impact of alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, and other maladaptive behaviors. Moreover, the social isolation and collective trauma caused by the <abbrev>COVID-19</abbrev> pandemic added fuel to an already raging fire, revealing massive cracks in a system for care that is barely functional. In the authors' assessment, no single drug, substance, or behavior is the culprit—the real issue is the untreated trauma that lurks underneath, causing people to seek out the relief of these substances in the first place. The literature and practice knowledge in the field of addictions have long identified untreated posttraumatic stress disorder as a relapse risk factor. There is a rich history of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (<abbrev>EMDR</abbrev>) therapy's role in helping to heal addiction at a holistic level due to the long-established connection between unprocessed trauma and addiction. <abbrev>EMDR</abbrev> therapists must remember that <abbrev>EMDR</abbrev> therapy is a complete system of psychotherapy and ought to be honored as such when conceptualizing cases connected to compulsive behavior, substance use disorders, or other addictions.",

Children with ASD demonstrate early deviations from standard social development that persist across their lifespan.

      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "abstract": "A complaint of bloating or swelling of sufficient severity to lead to medical consultation is the lead symptom of a syndrome (the fluid retention syndrome) which includes affective, somatic and autonomic symptoms. These appear to have a primary origin in a neuroendocrine disturbance of limbic and hypothalamic function and form a substantial part of the work-load of a menopause clinic. The fluid retention syndrome, in turn, is one component of a spectrum of affective-somatic-autonomic disorders which comprise a significant part of the general practitioner's work load. Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

It most commonly develops after an arm or leg injury. Patients typically present with extreme hyperalgesia and/or allodynia. The Budapest Criteria are used to make this clinical diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive management are critical because long-term outcomes are improved when treatment is initiated soon after symptom onset. The primary management options are rehabilitation and physical therapy, including such approaches as progressive tactile stimulation, normalization of movement to prevent limited range of motion, and others. No drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CRPS management, but some evidence supports the use of drugs used to manage other types of neuropathic pain (eg, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also are used, and corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, ketamine, and other drugs can be helpful, particularly for early-stage CRPS. When pain severity prevents patients from participating in rehabilitation, referral to a pain specialist is warranted for consideration of procedural interventions, including sympathetic nerve blockade and spinal cord stimulation.",

In specific, owing to the power of drug contrast with alternative products and owing to the effect of some drugs, it was considered that the drugs are (in spite of their side effects) more helpful and efficient to relieve neuropathic pain than the option, since neuropathic pain represents a serious illness and needs a more strong and effective therapy technology (particularly in severe cases).",

      "abstract": "The stability of sleep was examined in two kinds of induced insomnia, namely after caffeine administration and after hypnotic drug withdrawal. The duration of each episode of any one sleep stage or any episode of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness was determined. After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes. Caffeine 'insomnia' thus seems characterized by increased stability of wakefulness, and hypnotic withdrawal 'insomnia' by decreased stability fo sleep. The type of analysis undertaken in this study could increase understanding of other types of insomnia.",

      "title": "Beyond Dopamine: The 'Other' Effects of Antipsychotics: Antipsychotics Exert Anti-Immuno-Inflammatory, Antioxidative, and Neuroplasticity Effects",
      "abstract": "Ask any psychiatrist how antipsychotics (APs) work and the overwhelming response will be blocking dopamine receptors. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This mechanism of action (MOA) has been elevated to dogma because no agent has been approved for treating psychosis that does not exert a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist effect. However, as advances in the neurobiology of psychosis accelerate, several other functions of APs have been identified, which can be considered additional MOM that may help mitigate psychosis' deleterious effect on brain tissue. Consider the following beneficial effects of APs (especially second-generation APs [SGAs]) of which many clinicians are unaware: APs suppress induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (1) It is well established that psychotic episodes of schizophrenia are associated with neuroinflammation and elevations of cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-[alpha]), and interferon gamma (IFN-[gamma]). These inflammatory biomarkers are released by microglia, which are rapidly activated by psychosis (2) and mediate brain tissue damage during psychosis. APs' rapid inhibitory action on pro-inflammatory cytokines obviously is neuroprotective. APs suppress immune-inflammatory pathways. (3) This occurs with atypical agents but not haloperidol (4) and results in decreased IL-1 [beta] and IL-6 and transforming growth factor-[beta]. APs significantly decrease levels of neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATS) such as 3-OHK and QUIN, which mediate the immune-inflammatory effects on neuronal activity. APs also increase levels of neuroprotective TRYCATS such as kynurenic acid. (5) APs activate cholesterol-transport proteins such as apolipoprotein E (APOE). (6) This implies that APs may improve low levels of APOE observed during psychosis and decrease myelination abnormalities and mitigate impairment of synaptic plasticity. (7), (8) APs increase neurotrophic growth factors that plummet during psychosis, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor. (9) This beneficial effect is seen with SGAs but not first-generation APs (FGAs) and is attributed to strong serotonin 5HT-2A receptor antagonism by SGAs. (10) SGAs but not FGAs significantly increase the number of newly divided cells in the subventricular zone by 200% to 300%. This enhancement of neurogenesis and increased production of progenitor cells that differentiate into neurons and glia may help regenerate brain tissue lost during psychotic episodes. Various SGAs have neuroprotective effects: * Clozapine has neuroprotective effects against liposaccharide-induced neurodegeneration and reduces microglial activation by limiting production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals). (11) * Aripiprazole inhibits glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and, in contrast to haloperidol, increases BDNF, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-1[beta], and the anti-apoptotic protein Bc1-2. * Olanzapine increases BDNF, GSK-3[beta], and [beta]-catenin, increases mitosis in neuronal cell culture, and protects against neuronal death in cell cultures that lack nutrients (which fluphenazine or risperidone do not). * Paliperidone demonstrates a higher antioxidant effect than any other SGA and clearly is better than haloperidol, olanzapine, or risperidone in preventing neuronal death when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. * Quetiapine, ziprasidone, and lurasidone have inhibitory effects on nitric oxide release. Quetiapine, but not ziprasidone, inhibits TNF-[alpha]. * Ziprasidone inhibits apoptosis and microglial activation and synthesis of nitric oxide and other free radicals. * Lurasidone increases BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex of rodents. (13) Although most clinicians uphold the dopamine neurotransmitter model of schizophrenia (ie, a hyperdopaminergic state that requires treatment with dopamine antagonists), research is moving toward a multi-faceted neurotoxicity and neuroprogression model of impaired neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, immune dysfunction, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondria' dysfunction. …",

      "abstract": "Unexplained physical signs and symptoms represent a significant portion of patient presentations in acute care settings. Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

The whole clinical diversity of tobacco-smoking is reduced to the common system in which two independently existing variants of tobacco-smoking are distinguished: in the form of a tobacco-smoking habit and tobacco dependence. Tobacco dependence is viewed as a current psychopathological process having a localized and partial nature. A psychopathological delineation of tobacco dependence is provided. Three forms of tobacco dependence are described at the syndromal level. It is emphasized that tobacco dependence does not refer to toxicomania or narcomania in terms of its clinical manifestations, occupying an intermediate place in psychopathology, namely between mental health, one the one hand, and borderline neuropsychic disorders, on the other one.",

In the case of the latter, catatonia mostly resolves when the seizures respond to the anticonvulsive treatment. We report, to our knowledge, the first case of a patient without affective or psychotic disorder, who developed catatonia in the postictum and whose catatonia did not resolve with anticonvulsive treatment, but did so with lorazepam. We describe a 36-year-old man, with no psychiatric history, except for a possible disorder in the use of cannabis, who developed catatonia after epileptic seizures. The catatonia did not respond to the anticonvulsant therapy, but did so to lorazepam 17 mg/d. Lorazepam could be tapered slowly and stopped without reemergence of catatonic signs. Catatonia should be part of the differential diagnosis in patients with bradyphrenia and/or remarkable postictal behavior. This report shows that lorazepam should be taken into consideration (before moving to ECT), in cases of unresolved catatonia, even if the seizures are reduced with anticonvulsants.",

The case of Emma, who was presented to the pediatric emergency room, with numerous physiological complaints, such as; dizziness, severe headache, unconsciousness, vomiting. Specific examinations showed the absence of any possible organic cause. Based on the sessions conducted with the patient, it appears that the girl was sexually abused. During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives. The girl was asked to draw all the members of her family. Interpretation of drawing when observed for therapeutic purposes.",

Moreover, Alzheimer's or Parknson's diseases are otherwise incurable, so the application of rehabilitating procedures like music-based therapy becomes preferential. The advances both in the identification of the specific auditory musical-sensitive circuits and of the non-musical neuro-connections but activated indirectly by music, otherwise inaccessible by other techniques, and in the understanding of consciousness, which can be described by seven cognitive centers, allows to improve and develop the music based therapy. A multitask procedure based on the activation of these cognition centers is presented, allowing to increase the personal psychical engagement of the patient in the recommended music based therapeutic program, addressed both to the rehabilitation of the main degenerative disease and to the secondary induced dysfunctions. This procedure combines the evidence based medicine assisted by laboratory expertise for the determination of a correct diagnostic, and narrative based medicine allowing to quantify the personal engaging qualities of the patient with respect to the proposed music based program, reducing in this way the gap between these two basic procedures and bringing in a first plane the patient care, not only the disease, with beneficial consequence for the therapy efficiency and for the patient-medical care relations.",

It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

Prudent primary care and mental health clinicians should screen for insomnia using valid and reliable tools when clients report sleep difficulties. When screening is positive, further assessment with a sleep diary is warranted. The primary treatment for insomnia is CBT-I, and pharmacological treatment may provide temporary support for no more than 2 to 4 weeks.

However, perhaps the most important symptom in this context is the failure of attempts to stop smoking when a person tries to accomplish this. Frequent smoking is thought to set up a subconscious learning process linked to the release of nicotine from cigarettes.2 When a person decides to stop smoking, s/he is afflicted by urges to smoke, often in places where smoking has previously taken place.3 Furthermore, such a person usually experiences withdrawal symptoms.4 These are mostly adverse moods, but with some physical symptoms as well. It is thought that these urges to smoke are primarily responsible for the failure of most attempts to stop smoking. Without support around half of all attempts to stop fail within the first week of attempted abstinence.5 The typical smoker who seeks treatment for cessation has never managed more than a few weeks without smoking.6 The period of withdrawal varies by symptom, but typically lasts a few weeks.4 Therefore most smokers' experience of not smoking is state of withdrawal and perhaps beliefs that smoking is a stress reliever, for example, stem from experiencing withdrawal during abstinence.\n\nThe two main approaches to assist cessation are pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims primarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive symptoms. Behavioural support aims to boost or support motivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people's capacity to implement their plans to avoid smoking. These interventions last typically only a few months. It is thought that during these months, the strength of the associative learning between smoking and …",

This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
