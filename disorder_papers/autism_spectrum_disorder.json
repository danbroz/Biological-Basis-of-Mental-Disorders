      "title": "Functioning and development of conscious ability in communication, play, artistic activity",
      "abstract": "A necessary condition for the existence of conscious ability in the way of correlative correlation between the planes of mental acts (noesis) and content-meanings (noema) – is an activity. Despite the communicative content of other activities, there is actually a communicative activity – communication, the leading motive of which is communication itself. Psychological and physical contact with the object of such communication is a self-sufficient goal for the subject. The emotional-dispositional basis of his motivation is all kinds of love and amicability. Deprivation of communication causes serious damage to the mental health of almost all people. Therefore, communication is a basic condition and a way of normal functioning of human conscious ability, the main factor of mental development of speech as a basis for this ability of infants and young children, who desperately need communication, full of expressive manifestations of love and tenderness. Children, who suffer from the deprivation of such communication, noticeably lag behind in development: their own speech and understanding of what is addressed to them, intelligence, self-awareness, adequate emotionality, social activity and adaptability. Mechanisms of social-psychological interaction are gradually “connected” to the process of intuitive “interiorization” of infants and young children, the essence of which is that in the noems of the subject’s conscious ability, the attitude to him, to other people, to the world of authoritative and referent for him individuals and groups is reflected. The most powerful subjective factor of the effectiveness of a child’s personal development is authentic activity through the volitional effort required to follow the rules of the game that attracts and captures it. Children benevolently accept the restrictions required by the rules of the game and are happy to follow them, because these are the conditions for testing their mental and somatic life potential, because in the process of the game «play» the vital forces of the child that please her. Such pleasure is the emotional-motivational basis of any real game and the deep foundation of the psychological affinity of game self-limitation and self-overcoming with the morality and spirituality of a personality, and thus a subjective factor in the development of his spiritual-moral conscious ability. At the same time, its aesthetic sensitivity develops due to the fact that the rules of the game form the harmonious system that gives the aesthetic impression of the beauty of the game. The deep basis of motivation of artistic-figurative activity (creation and perception of works of art) is a secret human desire – freedom of spirit, liberation from the shackles of its biological and social “handcuff”. Therefore, the ideological-emotional core of the images of high art is the freedom-loving human spirit, which is subject to the urges caused by the biological nature of human and social taboos and imperatives that oppress him. In the process of artistic-figurative activity, the subject empathically identifies with the struggles of the spirit of the art works’ heroes. These empathic shifts of one’s own spiritual-moral ability delight the subject, who develops the emotional-dispositional foundations of corresponding noems of his conscious ability. Cognition requires a serious attitude and hard work, which is most motivated by interest in its content. An effective way of such interest is the game psychological content of teaching. In general, the question of including the game into cognitive activity makes sense only as a fulfillment of the learning process with game psychological content. To organically combine the hard efforts of students, which requires knowledge and assimilation of scientific truths and spiritual values with game attractiveness - is not easy, but possible, especially concerning subjects of artistic-aesthetic cycle due to the semantic affinity of motivation of game and artistic-figurative activities. A necessary condition for the humanistic mission of sport is that it must be a noble competition, that is, a real game.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this study is to research how to utilize nonverbal communication and what it means. Nonverbal behavior like tone or volume of voice, actions, touching are ways of communication which can complement or substitute for verbal language. Successful human relationships hinge on the ability to express oneself non verbally and to understand the nonverbal communication of others. The reasons why nonverbal behavior is important in communication are as follows. 1. Nonverbal behavior may form a universal language system. 2. Nonverbal behavior reflects one's social and cultural background. 3. Nonverbal behavior creates an expectation of the verbal message. 4. Nonverbal behavior is unconscious and instinctive, so people are apt to put more faith in it than utterances. 5. Nonverbal behavior can express feelings and emotions that can't be expressed through verbal language. 6. Because nonverbal behavior is visual, its expressive capability is strong. The subjects of this study are limited to facial expressions, eye contact, hand gestures and touching. Other elements of nonverbal communication like silence, physical appearance, the use of time, the use of space will be dealt with in the next study.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nonverbal communication is hard to define but is often said to be all those modes of communicating other than words or a parallel way to process social stimuli alongside language cues. The nonverbal communication system comprises facial expressions, body movements, vocalic or paralinguistic cues, personal and environmental space, objects, time, physical appearance, and smell/odor. These nonverbal modes perform important functions for us, such as sending relational messages, emotional expression, and impression formation. Theories have been developed to explain how some of these functions work, with particular attention given to changes in intimacy or immediacy (forms of relational messages) and deception and its detection.",

      "abstract": "Nonverbal communication is an instrument of information transmitting, such as written or spoken word, nonverbal messages are there to replace, intensify or contradict verbal messages. Nonverbal communication consists of sending nonverbal signals through facial expressions, gestures, posture, dressing style etc. With nonverbal communication people in interaction show true emotions and thoughts that they experience in certain situations. Nonverbal signals such as facial expressions or gestures should not be studied separately, but one should look at the context of the situation in which certain signals appear. Gestures as part of nonverbal communication serve to people so that they can transmit an idea, intention or a feeling. Sometimes gestures replace verbal messages, regulate converation, maintain listener's attention, emphasize certain messages etc. As one must not ignore the context of the situatuion in which certain gestures appear, the meaning of the same gestures, but in different cultures, must not be ignored. Ignoring the meaning of individual gestures in foreign cultures can lead to very unpleasant situations. People should be aware of different interpretations of the same gestures, so it can extenuate mutual interaction.",

      "abstract": "Stories of loss are often polyvocal, spoken differently from the perspective of the many participants in a grief system, or even from the vantage point of the many voices that issue from a given individual, simultaneously or across time. Disrupted narratives take two forms: those that are chaotic, and those that are conflictual. In both cases, an existing and previously adequate life narrative is challenged by the loss, and ceases to provide a coherent structure for integrating past experience, enacting a meaningful social role in the present, and projecting into the future. Intrapersonal chaos occurs when a loss intrudes into an individual's heretofore coherent story of the self or significant others, in such a way that it cannot easily be assimilated. Interpersonal chaos refers to the jarring disruption of a shared or communal narrative that leaves two or more persons struggling to make sense of the destabilizing transition, without access to any clear means of doing so.",

      "title": "Amae as seen in diverse interpersonal interactions",
      "abstract": "The word amae is generally used in the Japanese language with a variety of emotions depending on different interpersonal interactions. (1) When an adult identifies with an infant or a child and directs appropriate emotional availability, the affect of dependence and attachment that the adult recognizes in the child is called amae (the prototype of the word). (2) When an adult has little empathy with the dependency or attachment shown by the child, the adult negatively perceives that the child is \"amaeru-ing.\" Experiencing such discommunications, the child begins to test adults to see if they have empathy with him or her. In other words, he or she begins to formulate certain psychological functions linked with amae such as reading other people's expressions—hitomishiri (stranger anxiety) or enryo (hesitation or reserve). (3) When the child is good at actively manipulating the emotions of adults and creates such a state of affect as to satisfy his or her dependence or attachment, he or she is said to be an amaeru-ing child. (4) When the child, although he or she is actually dependent on or loved by adults, denies the fact and behaves innocently or defiantly, the child is said to be in a state of amae. The usage of the word amae described above can be observed in exactly the same manner in interactions between adults.",

      "title": "Teleological Behaviorism and the Problem of Self-Control",
      "abstract": "Abstract Problems of self-control as well as social cooperation may be seen as conflicts not between internal spiritual or neurological entities, but between highly valued overt behavioral patterns of differing temporal extents or social distances. For example, an alcoholic must choose between having a drink now—valuable in the short run—and being healthy, performing well at work, maintaining satisfying social relationships, etc. —valuable in the long run. The essential question addressed in this chapter is how the latter may come to dominate the former within a person's lifetime. A behavioral evolutionary process is proposed by which valuable temporally or socially extended behavior patterns evolve over an individual lifetime from simpler, shorter patterns. It is argued that complex patterns, such as social cooperation over long periods, arise from simpler patterns in behavioral evolution analogously to the way complex structures, such as the human eye, arise from simpler structures in biological evolution. The idea that complex, long-term behavioral patterns in conflict with short-term patterns, if they are not inherited in toto, must be generated by an internal and autonomous spiritual, neurological, or cognitive process is compared to creationism in biological evolution. The role of delay and social discount functions in measuring the extent of coherent behavioral patterns is explicated. Finally, the chapter examines several implications of teleological behaviorism for practical behavioral control.",

      "abstract": "Due to his relationship to alcohol which has cut off all other relationship, the alcoholic patient is left alone with a double image of himself: the image of what he has become and the one of what he has been or could have been. The therapist is therefore ill - at - ease in front of this splitting, with varied reactions influenced by his own personality, by the patient's personality and by what alcohol means to both of them. Several attitudes may result from this relational difficulty: rejection and possible referral to a \"specialist\", symptomatic treatment or rigid, ethical, defensive attitudes. The approach to be alcoholic should pass through acceptance of his relationship to alcohol and the privileged place it occupies in his life so as to enable him to have access to another relationship with some one who restitutes him his human dignity.",

      "abstract": "Severe trauma affects all structures of the self – one's image of the body; the internalized images of the others; and one's values and ideals – and leads to a sense that the self-coherence and self-continuity are invaded, assaulted, and systematically broken down. The traumatic events overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life and generally involve threats to life or bodily integrity, confront human beings with the extremities of helplessness and terror, and evoke the response of catastrophe. The vulnerable self-structure of traumatized individuals is evident in the following ways: (a) difficulties in self-regulation (self-esteem maintenance, lower tolerance levels, and the sense of self-discontinuity and personal agency), (b) appearance of the clinical symptomatology (frequent upsurges of anxiety/fear, depression, and specific fears or phobias regarding the external world or one's own bodily integrity), and (c) reliance on primitive or less-developed forms of the self-object relatedness. Severe trauma may lead to de-centering of the self (self-at-worst), loss of groundlessness and a sense of sameness, self-discontinuity and ego-fragility, leaving scars on the one's 'inner agency' of the psyche, fragmentation of the ego-identity resulting in proneness to dissociation.",

      "title": "Humane Taal en Afstandelijkheidscodes",
      "abstract": "After a selection from the remarks made by students about their preferen-ces towards writing in the I-mode, the YOU-mode or the ONE-mode, I propose two hypotheses: 1. There is a certain connection between the degree of self-experience and self-responsibility (primary existence) and the choice to speak or write in the I-, YOU- or ΟΝΕ-mode, but apparently it also holds that the choice of one of those modes restricts or elaborates the space a person has to express himself. More generally stated: There is a certain interaction between the way of existence of a speaker or writer and the way of self-denomination in his utterances. 2. There is a certain connection between the degree to which a speaker or writer a) has knowledge about himself and wants to be responsible for his feelings, thoughts and acts; b) guards or unveils his intimacy towards a hearer or reader; c) wants to be involved in or responsible for a process or activity outside his body; and the way he denominates himself or the outside process or activity in his utterances. I give some examples of ways of linguistic alienation, and propose an arrangement of the degrees of alienation in the same way as is done in language for local distances: HERE THERE YONDER SOMEWHERE NOWHERE I I, as a.. YOU ONE NONE (self) (increasing self-separation) (self-ignoring) (self-eliminating) I expect that children with a very sensitive linguistic intuition, draw conclusions about the reliability of adults from the way they use alienation codes; that human beings are or become strangers to one another, or are more attached as friends and lovers by using alienation codes or direct human language; that relational, social and economic victims advertise themselves as potential victims by the way they use alienation codes and do not recognize their potential oppressors by the way they use alienation codes. The main field of linguistic study as human linguistics lies in making clear what the differences are between direct human language and alienation codes.",

      "title": "Constructions of speech and thought representation",
      "abstract": "A lot of what humans communicate about concerns cognitive contents of various kinds produced by others or themselves: speech, thought, writing, emotional states, attitudes, hopes, and the like. Languages have developed specialized ways to structure the representation of such contents, especially in various dedicated forms of speech and thought representation. Represented content can also include embodied behavior, such as gesture, whether in cospeech gesture or in sign language. What is represented need not actually have been previously produced: represented contents can be future, hypothetical or nonexistent, and forms of so-called fictive interaction can be used in which the model of face-to-face interaction is used to talk about a variety of other meaning types. Speech and thought representation presupposes the existence of two speech events-a current and a represented one-and each comes with a speaker, defined linguistically in terms of their central deictic coordinates, I-here-now. The interplay of deictic features and different forms of structural integration can define specific types of construction, showing different degrees of access to the embedded mental space of the represented speaker's speech or thought, such as direct, indirect, and free indirect speech or thought. Social media forms of direct speech or thought merit separate investigation, as do subjective uses of reporting clauses such as I think, which form a distinct construction type, using a subset of the grammar of speech and thought representation for different purposes.

      "title": "Prosocial primates: selfish and unselfish motivations",
      "abstract": "Non-human primates are marked by well-developed prosocial and cooperative tendencies as reflected in the way they support each other in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression. The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is not to be confused with the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i) altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic impulse, which—as in humans—may be born from empathy with the recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of cooperation (i.e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies. This paper further reviews observational and experimental evidence for the reciprocity mechanisms that underlie cooperation among non-relatives, for inequity aversion as a constraint on cooperation and on the way defection is dealt with.",

      "title": "Seeking Communal Emotions in Social Practices That Culturally Evolved to Evoke Emotions: Worship, Kitten Videos, Memorials, Narratives of Love, and More",
      "abstract": "In many instances, emotions do not simply happen to people by chance; Often, people actively seek out an emotion by engaging in practices that have culturally evolved to evoke that emotion. Such practices tend to be perpetuated and spread if people want to experience the emotion, like to recall it and tell others about it, want to give the emotion to others and experience it together, and/or regard the emotion as a sign of something wonderful. We illustrate this with a newly delineated emotion, kama muta. Many social practices around the world are structured to evoke kama muta. In those culturally evolved practices, and outside them, what typically evokes kama muta is a sudden intensification of communal sharing, or a sudden shift of attention to a communal sharing relationship. It seems probable that other social-relational emotions are also evoked by sudden changes in relationships or the sudden salience of a relationship. This change or saliencing may be incorporated in social practices that are perpetuated because they evoke the sought-after emotion. We suggest that such practices, as well as sudden changes in relationships that occur elsewhere, are especially promising places to discover social-relational emotions.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of birth imposes upon man a relatively long period of helplessness—originally exclusively biological, but eventually social as well. It is at this point that he begins his long social conditioning history. His dependence on other people may lessen and his dependent behavior may change in form, but the class of behavior most generally labeled social behavior remains, and in many ways becomes more firmly controlled by other people. In our complex society the lack of social behavior is unheard of except in the extreme cases of the psychotic and the retarded, and even here there is most often evidence for some minimal social behavior. Living together is of course not restricted to man; animals also display social behavior. The definition of social behavior is then quite simple: It is behavior which varies as a function of other organisms—other organisms may elicit the behavior, set the occasion for it, or reinforce it. Furthermore, the behavior need not occur in the presence of other organisms to be called social—it may be related to other organisms only through stimuli which were once associated with them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The introduction describes Someone's structure and explains the term misfit sexuality in relation to common understandings of the term queer. Sexual misfits experience frustration in relation to their sexuality due to a misfit between 1) the physical and social practices that might constitute a sexuality, 2) the language that might be involved in accomplishing those practices or in reflecting on them, and 3) the categories (both practical and theoretical) that structure the social world and provide it with intelligibility. Sexuality is understood to be both one sociological variable that we use to identify ourselves and others, and the effect of a cloud of other sociological variables. Misfits are people who discover that they don't belong to the class that they have been taken (by themselves or by others) to belong to, because it happens that some criteria that nobody had ever mentioned (or would ever think to mention) has not been satisfied, or because they either lack an essential secondary property or possess a disqualifying one. The absence or presence of such a hidden or secondary property may not even be apparent until a certain event or interaction occurs, until a certain context emerges, or until a certain situation arises.",

      "title": "Perverse violence within the family and the resulting psychosomatic effects",
      "abstract": "In families, we can notice physical disorders in people living under the grip of the asymmetrical nature of narcissistic pervert links. The characteristic traits of these links are a degradation of one of the members of the link’s narcissistic integrity, together with a weakening of self-esteem, as a result of constant humiliations. The pervert’s victim suffers from fainting fits, allergic reactions, gastro-intestinal or vascular disorders, joints pain, somatizations or psychosomatic disorders with an anatomical starting point. The pervert can, in turn, develop physical disorders when he loses his superior stand and can’t express his distress, rant or hallucinate.The bond between the subjects of the link is weak or non -existent. There is a lack of mutual acknowledgement: the victim is not considered as a person by the pervert, he has no empathy towards the victim. The victim may even react with pleasure to belittlements thus encouraging him. The physical fits seem linked to the powerlessness to get rid of theses chains. The forces which look after self-protection are weakened. PFT and PCT cases will throw a light on these ideas.",

      "abstract": "Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. nonanthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces (1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, (2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and (3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",

Of particular importance are challenges concerning finding words and names, constructing utterances and stories, as well as remembering events and stories—and the combined effect of these. Having fewer resources available makes it difficult to tell stories in conversations, to listen to others’ storytelling, or to identify and grab a turn in a conversation to put in a word. One alternative is for the person with dementia to use <italic>embodied resources</italic>. The person with dementia can use other resources in combination with abilities that are still fully functional.

      "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drug (chemical) dependency (the excessive, maladaptive, or addictive use of drugs for no medical purposes&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;despite social, psychological, and physical problems that may arise from such use) is a widespread phenomenon. He (or she) loses freedom of choice. Because of a deep emotional and physical need of addicts to get a drug, their basic activity is inclined to supply &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance. Repeating use of substance and its effects, affect their health and interpersonal&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;relationships. Addict denies that. His (or her) possibility to recognize it is limited or ruined. Incorrect pattern of life persists.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Cognition of real facts about substance evidently does not protect enough from addiction. In this work effectiveness of a&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;specific, emotional approach in the therapy of addiction has been analyzed. Dependent is faced with another emotion,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;supposing competitive to those of consuming &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance it is. It is expected that strong emotion could activate&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;available, but unattended cognitive contents. Experimental confirmation of working hypothesis is based on emotional&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;approach to alcohol-dependents. They have been faced with an emotional (literal and /or painted) message of anonym child in the connection with children&amp;#039;s heavy firsthand experiences of alcoholism in the family. Facing consequences, marks and products of dependence (firsthand experienced children&amp;#039;s desperation), experiencing strong enough emotional answer, empathy with other child, alcoholic recognizes desperation of his own related. Faced those experiences, he recognizes their own parental role in their family as negative role. Skilled psychiatrist can use that empathy as significant therapeutic factor. This empathy makes dependent able to overcome fear of changes and face the necessity to change their pattern of life. Most of them, without any further explanations have been turned into insight of addiction and oriented toward the therapy and rehabilitation. Results encourage practicing physician to apply this approach, first of all in the initiation of the therapy (realizing contacts, insight into disease) and later in the psychotherapy of any kind of chemical dependence. The key task of the therapist could be to find out specific, strong enough emotion that could be in certain case competitive to those of pleasure connected to the misuse of substance and a strong challenge to initiate cognitive processes and to change executive behaviour.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

Sometimes it can also degenerate into psychopathological disorders as “lived time” and “lived space” chronic alterations. Nostalgia phenomenology is characterized by three conditions: loss (past), desire (future), absence (present). This work aims at investigating them throughout an omnipotence-impotence fluctuating taxonomy. We have two main phenomenological types: 1) negationist-obstinate (subculture: impossible); 2) resigned-depressive (subculture: anaclitic). Each psychological type has an equivalent social culture: 1) thanatophobic screen culture (subculture: Telemaco complex and migrations society); 2) impossible xenalgic-nostalgic (subculture: war orphans’ silent nostalgia society). Finally, we have a third category named resilient-nostalgic dealing with Art as absence transformation device. Nostalgia becomes a shared condition for all human beings, a “presentification” process about an eternal past",

      "abstract": "After all communication remains a bitter idea that one could communicate properly, and better, and more efficient, and lower overall costs. The idea that persists after any communication is that the communication was imperfect. Being imperfect, any communication is also a failure. The power of communication is the communication failure. The failure is to not express your-self perfect, or speak more or less than you should, or could not say everything, or being misunderstood. In essence, the failure and the primary means of communication to improve the communication would be expression, speech, discourse. Discourse can be verbal or non-verbal. In linguistic communication works the principle of general expression, the principle of strong effability (J. J. Katz). The range of expression through language we record influence of idea of ineffable: it is thought, content, feeling, feelings, expressiveness that cannot be expressed. Ineffable principle seems to be secondary. In fact, the natural state of the world is ineffability. Effability and Ineffability of communication are complementary principles. The power of communication is in communication failure. Perfection communication cancel communication, perfection does not allow self-reproduction of communication and therefore stimulate its implosion. Deficient communication process development support communication; communication failure is the communication power. Communication failure is a relatively late theoretical discovery of communication discipline. It follows that in a subsequent paper to investigate ”the principle of communication failure” that emerges from the research of several renowned experts in General Science Communication (C. R. Berger -1997; J. D. Peters; Noemi Marin - 2007).",

      "title": "Aesthetic regulation of objectionable representations.: A semiotic approach to memorials and religious architectural space.",
      "abstract": "Whenever a material object is selected to represent a physically absent, but emotionally present referent, such as a religious figure or a deceased relative, we have a complex representation situation that involves what we could tentatively label “transgressive cognitive acts”. A transgressive cognitive act is here meant to involve a part that is experienced as present, and as having an effect, but not evidenced from a rationalist or scientific perspective on existence. Sometimes, the complexity of this type of representation is such that argumentation beside the theological, e.g. aesthetic, comes to stand as vicarious to theological or existential opinions about the matter. The semiotics of such vicarious representation have to consider a “leaking” communication model where one part in the trinity - of the sender, the receiver or the referent - escape a coherent or evidenced definition (God can be all three, depending on type of communication). The fact that empirically non-existing referents have been recognized and theorized in semiotics (Eco; Sonesson; and others) does not explain why certain cases of absent semiotic agents, linked to religious belief, or to sense of presence in grief of a deceased person, may give rise to such extreme degree of emotion or sense of existence.Departing from a narrated episode written by J M Coetzee, about the controversy brought up by a crucifix, turning into a quarrel about aesthetic preferences, this paper discusses a series of designed or spontaneously created spatial representations of physically absent, but indirectly and emotionally present referents, as they appear in memorials, cemeteries and funeral chapels. In public acts of memorialisation, the physical objects that represent the deceased – like gravestones or memorial objects placed at sites representing the dead – are often strictly regulated, differently in different cultures. When for instance they appear at unexpected places in the urban environment, or with unfamiliar looks, memorials and their material culture can become highly controversial or be regarded as objectionable.These materialisations with a relation to religion, or existential belief, may give rise to arguments where the aesthetic aspect is the last chance to state a principle order in the cultural scheme in which they are debated. Such arguments are actualised in the current debate about post-secular societies, where it is for instance stated (Habermas) that both religious and secular mentalities must be open to a complementary learning if we are to balance shared citizenship and cultural difference in the post-secular society. It is an objective of this paper to show that the recognition of a semiotics that involves the paradoxical presence of emotionally strong, but fundamentally absent parts in communication can contribute to the aesthetics of physically present, but existentially debated objects, as well as to the discussion about the confronting as well as conjoining elements of regulation of these issues in society.

      "title": "[Support psychotherapy in traumatic situations].",
      "abstract": "It seems that a certain consensus exists to speak about a traumatic situation as an experience which is made up of a threat on the physical or psychological integrity of a person and against which one responds with fear, desperation and intensive horror. Different psychological phenomena are involved with the manner through which a human being confronts his/her past. In particular, the response to traumatic situations, mourning, and blame share their characteristic of being an irreversible living reality related to facts, loss or past impacts and it is necessary to integrate these in one's life in order to advance; these comprise a triangle frequently coexisting and interconnected. Aid for these three situations has, therefore, as common elements, two premises: an active task is required by the person who suffers this situation; this person must, in some form, desire to move ahead. One can not toil in mourning, in a traumatic experience, or in a life of blame if these have a positive symbolic value for this person; for example, mourning as a manner not to treason the dead person by forgetting that person, the reliving a trauma as an attempt to provide some sense to the actions which occurred, or blame as a desire to not forget an error or as a final punishment of this active task; the final objective of this active task is not usually to forget but to integrate in order to live. If a person does not perceive this clearly, this person may not become actively involved in the task to overcome a traumatic situation and to move ahead, nor will that person accept that a person who tries to help questions this person's realities or experiences.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores why direct observation of our own species behaviour is so little done in psychology and other social sciences.The very familiarity and the richness of our cultural understanding of our behaviour is paradoxically an impediment, since that understanding is couched in the language of an active participant in social interactions.That language acknowledges and communicates the subjective states of ourselves and others but it is not couched in the language of a scientist, who is an outsider, a passive observer, who does not use the terms of his subjects and does not study their subjectivity since it is not publically observable and cannot be agreed upon in the usual scientific way of demonstrating a phenomenon for anyone to observe.A major function of our rich everyday knowledge is to help us be successful social participants.That type of practical knowledge is not necessarily useful for a detached science.Other impediments include • our moral distaste at viewing our fellow human beings as objects without subjectivity • initial observations can seem banal and uninformatively familiar • direct observation is time consuming and expensive • specific research hypotheses seem lacking Two traditional ethological ways of describing behaviours -by morphology and by consequence.A disciplined seriously playful approach is advocated for the early stages of research, trying to find useful behaviour categories to measure.One aid to this is to look for natural divisions in the phenomena studied and quotes the Plooij's work comparing children's behaviour either side of regression (rapid development) periods in early development.",

Sometimes the purely play-motive is joined by a feature of something like sport, and the child tries to surpass his own or others' performances: to jump a little higher or farther, to stand still longer on one leg, and to utter louder shouts. The simplest playthings are objects left unchanged in their original form and only used as auxiliary to the aforementioned body-games: as when the child thumps on the table with a lump of wood to satisfy his craving for movement and his hunger for noise-stimulus. The part played by imitation in constructive games is evidently greater in the case of girls than with boys. Some children refused to play poverty of ideas of their own, or incapacity to carry on the game without help from playfellows.",

All animats use the same mechanisms for learning and decisionmaking. Each animat has its own set of needs and its own memory structure that undergoes continuous development and constitutes the basis for decision-making. The decision-making mechanism aims at keeping the needs of the animat as satisfied as possible for as long as possible. Reward and punishment are defined in terms of changes to the level of need satisfaction. The learning mechanisms are driven by prediction error relating to reward and punishment and are of two kinds: multi-objective local Q-learning and structural learning that alter the architecture of the memory structures by adding and removing nodes. The animat model has the following key properties: (1) autonomy: it operates in a fully automatic fashion, without any need for interaction with human engineers. In particular, it does not depend on human engineers to provide goals, tasks, or seed knowledge. Still, it can operate either with or without human interaction; (2) generality: it uses the same learning and decision-making mechanisms in all environments, e.g. desert environments and forest environments and for all animats, e.g. frog animats and bee animats; and (3) adequacy: it is able to learn basic forms of animal skills such as eating, drinking, locomotion, and navigation. Eight experiments are presented. The results obtained indicate that (i) dynamic memory structures are strictly more powerful than static; (ii) it is possible to use a fixed generic design to model basic cognitive processes of a wide range of animals and environments; and (iii) the animat framework enables a uniform and gradual approach to AGI, by successively taking on more challenging problems in the form of broader and more complex classes of environments",

      "abstract": "This report deals with how the Turkana people manage their involvement in situational activities. The Turkana often beg another for something. When begging, they are intensely absorbed in their emotion. The beggar's behavior seems dually characterized: the childish behavior with insufficient control over the self and the tactical one for negotiation. Also in situations other than begging, they are often deeply involved in immediate interactions. They, as participants in the interaction, persist in having their way and display the unperturbed self. They refuse anything provisional about themselves. Also within the level of assumed reality which attendants in the gathering sustain, they persist in refusing anything provisional. They affirmatively front whatever is presented. They never bother themselves with whether the reality sustained is true or false. While they are lively within the reality which is shared by all attendants, they are in any situations required to be deeply involved in their activities.",

      "abstract": "Five qualities have given man his ability to realize his full human potential: 1) an innate predisposition to gregarious life, 2) an aggressive instinct, 3) an aptitude for insight, 4) a capacity for gaining extensive knowledge and skills which are at his disposal independent of instinctual drives, and 5) an urge to acquire speech, enabling him to establish a second signal system as the basis of the unique human form of consciousness. The combination of the qualities 3, 4, and 5 are, as it were, man's accessories in his struggle for existence, and can be used to serve his aggressive needs. - Every cultural development leads in the course of generations to an increase of intellectual awareness, because an increasing share of indispensable knowledge must be passed on verbally. At the same time the importance of direct, practical first-hand experience and imitative learning declines. Especially for those men whose occupations primarily involve theoretical activities a discordance arises between the world of their imaginations and consciously-controlled ways of thought and behaviour on the one hand, and their endothymic impulses, moods and feelings (which mostly originate from the innate predisposition for gregarious life) on the other. If rationalistic processes predominate in shaping forms of social interaction, man will have to manipulate the behaviour of his fellow-men as well as his own mental capacities for emotional distancing, disregarding or even violating the incalculable \"endothymic\" part of his being. That may have disastrous effects.",

This book gives a full account of how emotions work in the mind and the body, according to both medieval and modern theories (Introduction, Saunders); how they function within a society or a group, notably that of the Round Table, or of the audience and readers of Arthurian literature (Gilbert, Lynch, Radulescu); the disjunction between emotion and effective action (Lynch); the mechanisms by which the emotions of a fictional character can be mirrored in a reader (Larrington); the capacity of sounds – even sounds with no semantic content – to convey feeling (Brandsma); and whether (or how far) emotions can be transferred across cultures (Rikhardsdottir). Their overlap and intersection with other schemata, of the passions or the vices, are discussed, along with the specific terms used to describe fear or anger or shame (Fuksas). The bodily expressions most commonly attached to specific emotions are explored, of going pale or red, changing expression, flinching or weeping. Medieval authors will typically portray emotions so as to suggest some kind of social function for their readers: how a king, or a knight, should act as well as feel. The model underlying all of these is the assumption that emotions are communicated socially. Even if the character feeling the emotion keeps it to him- or herself, the reader is granted privileged access to their unexpressed thoughts or feelings. Kings may be under an obligation not to be too open about their emotions (Baden-Daintree), but the readers will be shown what they feel; lovers may blush in public before retreating to their chamber or some other isolated spot to lament their state, as an abundance of Arthurian and other romances demonstrate, but the symptoms will be thoroughly familiar to readers trained to recognize them. But what happens when a bodily sign of emotion carries neither a familiar meaning nor an explanation within the text?",

Aggressive behaviour among peers seems to be established at this age and it is interesting to observe it within the Peer-groups. 2. A useful definition of aggression seems to be the following one: Aggression is any physical contact, direct or indirect, by which another person is hurt. 3. We observe five different forms of aggression: 3.1 Aggression by chance, without any aim, happening out of awkwardness and motoric clumsiness. This kind of aggression becomes rarer during the second year. 3.2 Manipulating one another, as shaking arm or leg of another child, pulling his hair, tapping his body and so on, giving the impression of the aggressor exploring his partner. This kind of aggression also becomes rarer during the second year. 3.3 Robbery of objects, i.e. toys being in the hands of another; the reaction of the victim is increasing during the second year. 3.4 Aggression in order to control the group and to establish leadership in connection with the development of a group hierarchy. 3.5 Pathologic Aggression, observed on a child of the group with brain dysfunction. The child overthrows others from behind, climbs on them and bites them in the ear, the neck or the cheek. 4. We still need more observation on Peer-groups of this age to know more about the beginning and development of the here described phenomena.",

      "title": "2 Embodiment and action",
      "abstract": "Emotion is at times foregrounded by psychonarration and manifested in utterances; more frequently its presence is indicated by somatic indices: by embodied responses and deliberate gestures. This chapter defines 'affect', somatic sensations that function at a preconscious level, and continues by exploring how medieval emotion is written on bodies, thus revealing interior emotional states. The cardiocentric model, in which emotion is understood as focused on the heart, is outlined; affect theory is utilised to unpack how medieval writers understood physical manifestations of emotion as central to contemporary theoretical formulations of the role of will in emotion, as both preconscious and yet bound up in complex cognitive interactive processes. Characters faint, change colour or fall silent, behaviours which register different kinds of feeling as in play. Turning pale, for example, can express fear or anger: precisely which emotion is at stake is crucial for the status of the chivalric male figure; trembling can be equally ambiguous. Certain behaviours – laughing, weeping – fall between the involuntary and deliberate: women can weep on cue, it is suggested, and laughter rarely expresses happiness, but rather triumph. Bodies can also express emotion through deliberate behaviour in the form of gesture: kissing, kneeling, leading by the hand and smiling all indicate different kinds of emotion that is both felt and publicly performed. The strategic deployment of emotive indicia could trump the 'natural' movements of the humours and the spirits within the body, an understanding that problematises the connections between affect, will and motivation.",

      "title": "Literary Conventions and the Human Body: The Use of Bodily Expressions for States of Mind",
      "abstract": "A. Correlation expression and state of mind 1. Evidence Variations in the mood of speakers habitually co-occur with variations in their facial expressions or movements. This kind of correspondence has been observed and commented on [i], not least in the medical literature, where speakers with different types of handicap, mental and others, have been studied. [ii] That we are not alone in the animal world in this respect is shown by studies of apes [iii] and monkeys [iv], where similar relations have been found. From a communicative point of view we may, with Wierzbicka (1995), make a distinction between bodily actions which function as speech [...] and actions which while meaningful cannot be seen as speech surrogates (209). Although many physical manifestations are deliberately communicative [v], such as hugs and kisses as expressions of friendship or love, physical manifestations are unconscious or semiconscious perhaps most of the time, and speakers vary with regard to their wish and ability to control them. Consequently, a given physical expression can be assumed to indicate a certain emotional state while a given emotional state cannot without reservation be expected to result in a certain physical expression. [vi] As this relation between certain mental states and physical expressions is fairly well established [vii], writers, particularly writers of fiction, have been quick to make use of it. It is obvious, therefore, that it has aspects of interest to linguistic and communicative studies. Kurath (1921) observed, as Sweetser (1990:28) notes, that Indo-European words for the emotions are very frequently derived from words referring to physical actions or sensations accompanying the relevant emotions, or to the organs affected by those physical reactions. What the present study will do is consider the stage preceding that discussed by Kurath, viz. the stage where the physical actions or sensations have not yet become, or are just beginning to become, lexicalised as purely emotional expressions. The study will thus look into the way in which states of mind are represented as physical expressions in written English. It will use material from two language corpora, viz. the 57-million-word Cobuild Direct Corpus (examples where the reference follows the text) and the 100-million-word British National Corpus (examples where the reference precedes the text). An important question to be addressed will then be to what extent the actual physical manifestations represented in writing can be assumed to be present in the persons referred to. For example, can a person said to be tearing his or her hair out in exasperation actually be assumed to be physically doing so, or has the phrase become just a literary device to signify an emotional state? Is the link between the state of mind and its physical manifestation being severed? 2. General validity? There has been a great debate as to whether terms and relations in the emotional field established for one language community can also be taken to apply to other language communities. [viii] Wierzbicka, for one, emphatically denies that this could be the case: [A]s empirical cross-linguistic studies show, there are simply no emotional expressions interpreted the same way across cultures ... (2000:149). The present little study is only concerned with English, so the question whether the expressions can be translated and whether they apply in the same way to states of mind in other language communities does not arise. Moreover, we are not here concerned with deliberately communicative manifestations, such as handclapping, hugging and kissing, but rather with mostly unintentional and perhaps unconscious ones like pursing one's lips or dropping one's jaw. B. Literary use The fact that facial expressions and movements are often unconscious and yet expressive of some mental state makes them an obvious medium for anyone wanting to observe, study and describe internal processes in our fellow human beings. …",

This seems true for some behaviours in early childhood autism. Ethology has specialized in analyzing such non-verbal behaviour. Ethological motivation analysis, the study of context dependence and of the development of such behaviours in the individual patient should be exploited for their interpretation. Mere description of behaviour is not likely to contribute much. Psychiatric thinking on the interaction of genetic and environmental factors does not fully agree with ethological and biological views.",

      "abstract": "Embodiment approaches to cognition and emotion have put forth the idea that the way we think and talk about affective events often recruits spatial information that stems, to some extent, from our bodily experiences. For example, metaphorical expressions such as \"being someone's right hand\" or \"leaving something bad behind\" convey affectivity associated with the lateral and sagittal dimensions of space. Action tendencies associated with affect such as the directional fluency of hand movements (dominant right hand-side - positive; non-dominant left hand-side - negative) and approach-avoidance behaviors (forward - positive; backwards - negative) might be mechanisms supporting such associations. Against this background, experimental research has investigated whether positive and negative words are freely allocated into space (e.g., close or far from one's body) or resonate with congruent (vs. incongruent) predefined manual actions usually performed by joysticks or button presses (e.g., positive - right; negative - left, or vice versa). However, to date, it is unclear how the processing of affective concepts resonate with directional actions of the whole body, the more if such actions are performed freely within a context enabling both, lateral and sagittal movements. Accordingly, 67 right-handed participants were to freely step on an 8-response pad (front, back, right, left, front-right, front-left, back-right, or back-left) after being presented in front of them valence-laden personal life-events submitted before the task (e.g., words or sentences such as \"graduation\" or \"birth of a child\"). The most revealing finding of this study indicates that approach-avoidance behaviors and space-valence associations across laterality are interwoven during whole body step actions: Positive events induced steps highly biased to front-right whereas negative events induced steps highly biased to back-left.",

      "abstract": "The essentials of an education are: (1) a knowledge of actual life; (2) a definite impelling interest in some phase of life; (3) the recognition from actual experience of one's own capacity and limitations of adjustment; (4) the acquirement of the emotional attitudes and habits necessary for perceiving and adapting to reality. These ensure against nervous breakdown, but are not synonymous with modern education, which views the problems of man as he was or may become, not his reactions as he is. Life is a process of slow adjustment, and must be accepted as it is. If elemental biological facts are not faced squarely serious personal difficulty arises. Conflict to the point of mental depression can be so met as to preserve sound personal judgment on public questions. Individual conscious processes are not so essential to adjustment as is believed: decision is made from well grounded feeling, often not from reason which can be logically detailed. An outstanding example is Abraham Lincoln, whom science cannot explain by his heredity or early experiences. Successful life implies consciousness of the reality of environment, and avoids the visions of intemperate idealism. The student is not taught to know himself, to estimate the present, and to intelligently adjust to immediate circumstances.

Firstly, mirror-neurons and, likewise, animal abilities connected with the visual field of their fellows, although they certainly constitute important landmarks, would not require this second mental centre. Secondly, others’ beliefs would have given rise not only to predicative communicative function but also to pre-grammatical syntax. The inquiry about the evolutionary-historic origin of language focuses on the cognitive requirements on it as a faculty (but not to the indirect causes such as environmental changes or greater co-operation), pays attention to children, and covers other human peculiarities as well, e.g., symbolic play, protodeclaratives, self-conscious emotions, and interactional or four-hand tasks.",

Dugas calls intimidation, to distuinguish it from reflective timidity, is ' due to the distress arising from the realization of the lack of sympathy between ourselves and our environment.'Reflection is apt to create a certain exaggeration of this feeling, so that the person affected ' begins to despise himself, to exaggerate his perplexities, and to pet his anger.'He is apt to isolate himself intellectually.While his thinking may be original, it will lack social adaptiveness.On the affective side there is a tendency to conceal sentiments of his own, and to distrust the sympathy of others.Hence the reserve that is characteristic of timidity.He may be further affected by a certain maladie d'iddal, or tendency to despise the things of ordinary life in comparison with his fancies.On the volitional side his acts are apt to be impulsive, and are often incomprehensible to himself, mainly because he no longer has the power of deliberate judgment.Finally, in its spontaneous form timidity marks a normal state in mental growth, that stands midway between the pure reflex life of the child and reflective mental life.Between the more abnormal form and genius a possible relation is suggested.The exclusiveness which the timide seeks, while it cannot of itself inspire art, may give occasion for its development.",

      "abstract": "Every society is held together by certain modes and patterns of communication that control the kind of society it is. One may call them information systems, codes, message networks, or media of communication; taken together they set and maintain the parameters of thought and learning within a culture. Just as the physical environment determines what the source of food and exertions of labor shall be, the information environment gives specific direction to the kinds of ideas, social attitudes, definitions of knowledge, and intellectual capacities that will emerge. For example, there are people, like the aborigines, whose repertoire of communication possibilities consists almost entirely of talking to each other, face to face. The word is never isolated from the body that produces it. There is, therefore, always an immediate and specific context in which meaning is shared. Feedback is never an issue: communication always includes response. This situation gives both their interactions and their thought a high degree of subjectivity, spontaneity, and emotion. But it does not provide an occasion or stimulus for sustained speculation. Without disembodied words there is no disinterested thought. Everyone is, so to speak, an existentialist. Introduce hieroglyphics or, if you can imagine it, a tape recorder to such people and you will alter their information environment, and with it, the sort of people they will be. When a medium of communication has the power to disembody words, to split them away from their original source, the psychological and social effects of language are forever changed. In such an environment, language becomes something more than a mode of communication. It becomes an object of contemplation. One may look at it, as in a mirror, and study how it is put together, with the result that the mind itself may become an object of contemplation. At which point philosophers (not to mention grammarians) must emerge to reflect on reflection and on what might be the connection between language and reality. Everyone may become a Platonist. Or this may happen: Let us assume an aborigine has conceived of a way to chisel a message on stone. The message being more durable than its author, it will become more important than he, and will be read and reread over centuries. In such a situation, we should not be surprised if readers not only dispute the meaning of the message but ponder the meaning of time, and then of mortality itself. It is in fact not uncommon for people whose messages have endured, unchanging, for centuries to become obsessed with time, as were the ancient Egyptians and the Mayans. And this may happen, too: A few will learn the symbols in which the message is encoded, and most will not. Thus, the few will be in possession of information to which the many have no access. The few will have, or seem to have (which is the same thing in this case), enormous and secret powers. Thus, priests will emerge to whom special privileges will be given and in whom there will reside special powers of explanation and authority. And suppose it happens that someone, through accident or design, discovers that messages do not need to be chiseled in stone but can be scratched on a leaf or a reed. To be sure, not a very durable medium but one that can be carried far and wide and with considerable speed. Perhaps then the obsession with time will recede, to be replaced by a fascination with the mysteries of space. Thus, explorers and conquerors may emerge, and messages will tell of things happening in other places but maintain silence on what has happened in other times. I shall not speak here of what may happen if you introduce television to a culture such as ours. What I wish to explore is the idea that the means by which people communicate comprise an environment just as real and influ-ential as the terrain on which they live. And further: that when there occurs a radical shift in the structure of that environment this must be followed by changes in social organization, intellectual predispositions, and a sense of what is real and valuable. …",

It means happening by chance, not planned rather incidental e.g., a casual encounter, a casual meeting, a casual visit etc. It is made or done without much care or thought viz., a casual remark, a casual invitation. Thus, the term casual is widely used. In derogatory sense it signifies irresponsibility showing too little concern and interest as well. For example, the company’s casual attitude to office security invites danger. It stands for not careful or thorough i.e., not serious eg., a casual inspection, a casual glance at a book, a casual observer. In case of clothes, a casual short-sleeved shirt is an example of casual wear which is simply an informal dress. Similarly, in the market shoes are displayed with the message :a pair of man’s casuals. Shoes, clothes, etc. designed for informal occasions do not obey dress conduct.Thus, casual wear means relaxation. It disobeys or rebels against the so-called conduct. Here, men and women enjoys free style which differs from so-called smart wear.",

      "abstract": "The communicative and social value of affect may never be fully appreciated at a conscious level until it is compromised. In fact, much of our communication is carried out not through our words, but with the affective features that accompany those words: the prosody of our speech, our facial expressions, and body postures. Consider, for example, the disrespectful \"tone of voice\" that a teenager might use when speaking to a parent. (In the T.V. sitcom Seinfield, Jerry's mother refers to this as \"the tone\" and warns Jerry not to use it with her.) In the nonverbal domain, consider \"the look\" that some mothers use to control their children's behavior. Indeed, we can communicate \"volumes\" without speaking. In addition to our facial expressions, our body postures and the way we \"carry\" ourselves can communicate internal mood states such as excitement, defensiveness, and depression. For example, a quick look at a good friend may prompt us to ask, \"Are you all right?\" In all of these examples, of course, the affective communication is two-sided. One person is expressing a feeling or thought and the other is perceiving and interpreting the intent of these expressions.",

The first form of communication between the self and external objects, is a direct consequence of internal communications that take place between internal part objects, which can be projected into external objects by means of projective-introjective identifications. Ego elements are often projected in the transference, as when patients project into the analyst unconscious beta elements together with the alpha function or thinking mind capable of containing and metabolising them. Feelings such as \"helplessness\" and \"hopelessness\" are at the centre of any form of pre-conceptual trauma, resulting from the discrepancy existing between the child's vulnerability and the parental domination. Interaction between introjected and projected correlated elements represents a reproduction of what takes place between these same parts inside the mind.",

Vulnerability is no longer restricted to the domain of the badly-integrated or excluded, it touches the whole of the social world. Vulnerability as being specific to the responsible human being, a vulnerability of a moral nature, as it were, and vulnerability making it impossible for a person to appear to the world, in other words a vulnerability of a social nature. Responding to the potential vulnerability of the other person, is the vulnerability of he who responds and who not only 'always has one response more to give' but a responsibility which is inexhaustible.",

      "title": "“<i>Now everyone knows I’m a serial killer</i>”",
      "abstract": "Drawing on data from a series of informal conversations about public safety and police-community relations, we distinguish between a speaker’s generalized communicative intentions with respect to metaphor use and story-telling, based on what Chafe (1994, p. 145) calls “unifying ideas that persist in semiactive consciousness” and the spontaneous intentions that arise within the short-term focus or spotlight of consciousness and guide the production of actual utterances. Although speakers occasionally enter a conversation with a fixed intention to express an idea with a particular metaphor, tell a particular story in a particular style, or accomplish some other speech act, such as persuading or informing, more commonly in ordinary conversations speakers begin with only a generalized intention to engage in the social interaction, sometimes but not always accompanied by generalized intentions regarding a particular topic or a particular form of expression. We argue that these “unifying ideas” interact with the contents of the short-term focus or spotlight of consciousness to generate spontaneous communicative intentions that in turn guide the production of metaphors, stories, and other language segments. Often these spontaneous communicative intentions arise interactively in response to other participants’ utterances; sometimes they arise in response to unforeseen opportunities in the speaker’s own utterances. Consequently, in ordinary casual conversations the spontaneous communicative intentions behind metaphor, story-telling and humor are often formed ‘on the fly,’ in response to the dynamic social interaction, and sometimes as a result of collaboration with other participants.",

      "abstract": "Balance disorders may result from an impairment of one of the sensorial modalities involved in the perception of the self-location in space: vestibular, proprioception and vision, a deficit of the neuronal multisensorial integration, a less effective motor or loco-motor system, the medication side effects or psychological interferences. The basic examination of a dizzy patient implies the assessment of these different aspects. The balance is not restricted to à set of reflexes. It is a distinctive expression of the sixth sense : the sense of orientation. For every moving being, to go around in circles is ineffective to find new sources of food or avoid a predator. So, the ability of self-orientation in space is a primitive, unconscious function, critical to stay alive and closely related to the limbic system. The experience of the mobility, that required the spatial memory, which evolved towards the episodic memory, could be considered as the foundation of our thought.Les troubles de l’équilibration trouvent leurs origines dans une défaillance des modalités sensorielles de la perception de soi dans l’espace : vestibulaire, somesthésique ou visuelle, d’un déficit de l’intégration neuronale de celles-ci, dans une perte d’efficacité du système moteur ou loco-moteur, ou en raison d’une interférence de facteurs médicamenteux ou psychiques. L’examen de base du patient instable cherchera à évaluer ces différents axes. L’équilibration n’est pas une combinaison de réflexes. Elle est un aspect particulier d’un sixième sens : le sens de l’orientation dans l’espace. Pour tout être mobile, tourner en rond est sans utilité pour trouver des ressources nutritives et échapper aux prédateurs. L’orientation dans l’espace est donc une fonction primitive, inconsciente et souvent vitale, ce qui explique sa relation étroite avec le système limbique de gestion des émotions. La mobilité a imposé le développement d’un sens de l’orientation puis une mémoire spatiale qui a évolué vers la mémoire épisodique, fondement de notre pensée.",

Apart from being (one way or other) involved in the language, they all would share a demanding requirement – a second mental centre within the subject. This redefinition of the simulationism is extended in the present book in two directions. Firstly, mirror-neurons and, likewise, animal abilities connected with the visual field of their fellows, although they certainly constitute important landmarks, would not require this second mental centre. Secondly, others’ beliefs would have given rise not only to predicative communicative function but also to pre-grammatical syntax. The inquiry about the evolutionary-historic origin of language focuses on the cognitive requirements on it as a faculty (but not to the indirect causes such as environmental changes or greater co-operation), pays attention to children, and covers other human peculiarities as well, e.g., symbolic play, protodeclaratives, self-conscious emotions, and interactional or four-hand tasks.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most primate species live in complex and dynamic social groups that present them with difficult cognitive problems on a continuing basis. All theories of primate social cognition assume this fact, although whether and in what ways primate social life is more complex than that of other mammalian species is a difficult question. Cheney et al. (1987) noted that although differences between primates and other mammals are not especially obvious, there are three characteristics of primate social life that together may make for special complexities. First, in a purely quantitative sense, most primates live in complex social groups that result in “a complex network of interactions, with many alternative strategies for survival and reproduction.” Second, primates form various types of long-term social relationships with others involving kinship, dominance, and short-term coalitions, and these may change over the life cycle. Third, primates have an extremely varied repertoire of means for expressing themselves socially in terms of species-typical displays that make manifest their emotional states and behavioral intentions. Although it would be difficult to document primate uniqueness in any one of these characteristics, together they make for a highly complex form of sociality that may encourage the development of all kinds of social knowledge, social strategies, and social learning (see Cords, in press, for a review).",

Four cases will illustrate that in psychosomatic patients a as if actionability, e.g. as a mere over-adaptation following life-events of significant others, is predominantly given replacing a self-conform action-ability, and that the assertion of self-feeling is preponderantly fixed to the somatic phenomena. Thus the historical life-performance remains arrested by the predominance of unachieved affective moments in the condition of an affective ambivalence, though psychosomatic patients are well aware enough of the existential necessity to arrange temporality as an existential quality of the futural aspects of their life-performance.",

Possessing one's own life story, however, is not a given. Thinking of one's life as a story, as something that can be narrated, involves social processes and conventions operative well beyond individual processes of reflection or experience. Narrating one's life, then, is to situate oneself and to be situated in dialogue with society. 1 As such, whether one's narrative is consensual with or contradictory to social norms, such narration signals possession of shared structures of possibility, including normative understandings of history, memory, knowledge, and truth.

      "abstract": "This work discusses basic human senses: sight; sound; touch; taste; and smell; and the way in which it may be possible to compensate for lack of one, or more, of these by explicitly representing stimuli using the remaining senses. There may be many situations or scenarios where not all five of these base senses are being stimulated, either because of an optional restriction or deficit or because of a physical or sensory impairment such as loss of sight or touch sensation. Related to this there are other scenarios where sensory matching problems may occur. For example: a user immersed in a virtual environment may have a sense of smell from the real world that is unconnected to the virtual world. In particular, this paper is concerned with how sound can be used to compensate for the lack of other sensory stimulation and vice-versa. As a link is well established already between the visual, touch, and auditory systems, more attention is given to taste and smell, and their relationship with sound. This work presents theoretical concepts, largely oriented around mapping other sensory qualities to sound, based upon existing work in the literature and emerging technologies, to discuss where particular gaps currently exist, how emotion could be a medium to cross-modal representations, and how these might be addressed in future research. It is postulated that descriptive qualities, such as timbre or emotion, are currently the most viable routes for further study and that this may be later integrated with the wider body of research into sensory augmentation.",

The differentiation between psychotic, neurotic, or autistic functioning depends in part on whether or not it is possible to develop a contact barrier. Some autistic children are echolalic, so their verbal productions seem very limited and bizarre. The behavior of autistic children becomes automatic and mechanical. Autistic children seem to skip weaning—they maintain the illusion that mouth, tongue and breast are one—and they skip all the steps of growing up that imply weaning as a differentiation process. Infants that develop autistic tendencies do not tend to explore their own bodies, or the vocalization of sounds they produce. There is a difference between the transitional objects and playing with sounds and the use, including the imitative use of autistic objects of sensation.",

The findings and cross-cultural examples explored here contrast with other work in the field where such experiences are described, but insufficiently analysed, as common, folk, invisible or implicit religion. Scholars in the study of religion are often ill-equipped with appropriate concepts and terminology, mainly because they often seek to classify such experiences into different realms, such as sacred/profane or this world/other world. Those divisions do not seem to be significant, if they are apparent at all, to the informants who experience such phenomena. The majority of those experiences occur through bereavement, where belief narratives describing the experience of ‘sensing’ deceased relatives suggest a self-conscious desire and performative strategy to continue their belongings.Many people do not need religion or God to mediate those experiences, prompting the author to analyse the experiences as sensual, emotional, cognitive, self-mediated, and performative, produced in specific social contexts and explained with reference to longings for belongings. They are frequently supported by collective, social interpretations. In illustrating how informants experienced transcendent, non-material feelings and sensations in their ‘here and now’, transcendence is relocated to a non-spatial, temporal, social realm. That shift is made possible by ‘believing through bereaving’, supported by collective memory and desires for continuing relationships.",

The amount of pleasure or displeasure aroused by a given stimulus is not invariable—it depends on the internal state of the stimulated subject. Factors that can modify the internal state and in turn induce alliesthesia are as follows: internal physiological variables (e.g., deep body temperature or body dehydration modify the pleasure of thermal sensation or taste of water); set points (e.g., during fever the body temperature set point is raised and pleasure defends the elevated set point); multiple peripheral stimuli (e.g., mean skin temperature determines the set point for deep body temperature and in turn generates alliesthesia); and past history of the subject (e.g., association of a flavor with a disease or a recovery from disease renders it unpleasant or pleasant). Positive alliesthesia indicates a change to a more pleasurable sensation; negative alliesthesia a change to a less pleasurable one.",

      "abstract": "Norms are instructions how to act. Their form is the imperative or hypothetical imperative: ‘Do X’, ‘Don’t do X’, or ‘if Y, then do X’. There are moral norms, epistemic norms, norms of practical rationality, and social norms. In following norms we come to believe truths, to be justified in our belief, act rationally, lead a virtuous life, and act in morally permissible ways. In following social norms we come to lead a life that is acceptable to a given society, a life that conforms to this socially established way of living. Social norms thereby differ from other norms in that their prescriptions are relative rather than universal. At the most trivial level these norms can be no more than a matter of etiquette: they are a matter of adopting the right register, wearing the right clothes, or, for instance, using the outermost knife and fork first. In these matters most would accept that when in Rome one should do as the Romans do. But this easy-going relativism towards the prescriptions of social norms is not always so easy: social norms can be strongly felt. And nor are all social norms trivial: adopting the right register, for instance, can shade into treating someone the right way and thereby engage moral norms. Similarly, prescriptions of politeness can overlap with epistemic prescriptions. ‘Believe people’ might be a matter of politeness, but it could also be an epistemic norm if truth-telling were the norm. Is ‘tell the truth’ a social norm, and so the norm? Should we believe people? This chapter aims to argue that, roughly speaking, we have these social norms. It aims to offer an explanation of these social norms and an account of how this bears on epistemological theories of testimony as a source of knowledge.",

      "title": "PHILOSOPHY, ADVERTISING MYTHS AND MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Being concerned with current matters, ordinary man is used to have a regular approach on life, by means of efficiency oriented skills. Carried out by worries and hopes, he does not allow himself to breed the taste for speculation. Usually, his horizon of questions regarding man and life is often mistaken for the sphere of immediate needs – in what concerns its level, contents and solutions. Raising questions – when it happens and inasmuch as it happens – appears attached to unusual events (either good or bad) and, most of the time, just inasmuch as these require a certain effort in order to be integrated into what is called habits. Ordinary judgement is in terms of action and utility. The meaning of life is neither obsession, nor a release of passion, since physical and soul energies are oriented towards goals that do not allow somebody to appeal to reflection. Playing with abstract arguments is frightening, distracts from those acts that are experienced as obligations, and this is why it will be avoided, as much as possible. Self preservation instinct works well enough. Man has the taste for relativity; daily activities witness for the weaknesses of humanity and the powers of hazard, shaping his wisdom; life is intuitively taken as a value, and it is worth living even if there are no strong meanings; thus, life is above all ideas describing it. Daily life receives a immediate link between theory and practice, between knowledge and action; we live under the impulse of satisfying needs; this is why choosing goals and means cannot be endlessly suspended in order to make room for deliberative reflection; one makes appeal to already given knowledge and value instruments that have a certified efficiency. This is why daily subjective life oscillates between decisions founded on momentary, passing and inconsistent reasons and decisions determined by rigid grounds, although they seldom conceptually clarified (tradition, habits). Ordinary consciousness behaves like a receptacle: the knowledge of reality – taken as a mirroring of reality by thought and senses – remains at the stage of noticing and uncritical description of some empiric correlations, of factual observations, of some modes of external phenomenal manifestation. Realism that is based on the “logic of senses” combines with the concern for normative aspect of life and action. “Common sense – says Lucian Blaga – is due to some ideas acquired by human spirit in time, by means of living together with the others.

This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

The elevation of touch to paramount importance has gone unchallenged because, prior to the present study, no individual with a congenital lack of somatosensation has been reported, much less studied for psychosocial development. Here we describe Kim, who since birth, has been unable to perceive touch, temperature changes, or pain on the body surface. Despite her inability to sense physical contact, Kim has above-average intelligence. She functions normally in social situations with a variety of people, recognizing emotions in herself and others and demonstrating appropriate affect. Kim experiences anxiety that appears grounded in realistic fears and uncertainties particular to her somatic insensitivity, thus serving as adaptive vigilance in reaction to an abnormal sensorium. Her normal socioemotional development, evident from an early age, likely resulted from Kim being able to appreciate her parents’ loving care through gaze, movement, and hearing. In sum, Kim upends the idea of touch as critical to developing a sense of self, secure attachment, and family bonds.",

Symbolic systems arise when the third semiotic mode is combined with a combinatorial principle typical of information processing. Symbols are not directly representational, since they do not show the associative relation typical of the first two semiotic modes. The brain is not able, with its intrinsic resources, to give rise to a symbolic system, but needs external, physical units (phonemes, gestures, and so on) to be combined to form communicative structures as sentences and discourses. These units are both discrete and codified. Nonhuman primates' inability to possess a true language is due, at least in part, to their failure to discover the principle of combination.

      "abstract": "What is the relationship between spatial language and abstract concepts? When people talk about abstract things that they can never see or touch, they often use spatial metaphors (e.g., a long vacation, a high price, a close friendship). According to theories of metaphorical mental representation, linguistic metaphors reflect underlying mental metaphors. Yet, behavioral experiments show that this is only one of the possible relationships between spatial metaphors in language and our spatial conceptualizations of abstract domains. In some cases, linguistic metaphors not only reflect speakers' thoughts, they also change those thoughts, such that people who use different linguistic metaphors rely on correspondingly different mental metaphors. Alternatively, spatial metaphors in language may reflect the way people conceptualize an abstract domain in some circumstances, but not in others. Finally, spatial language may reflect the way an abstract domain is typically conceptualized by some people, but not by others. There is no single relationship between spatial language and abstract concepts. Discovering whether (and under what conditions) a linguistic metaphor corresponds to a mental metaphor can illuminate the ways in which our interactions with the physical and social environment shape our mental lives.

      "title": "Ethological strategies for defence in animals and humans: Their role in some psychiatric disorders",
      "abstract": "Ethological strategies for defence in animals and humans are expressed as either aggression or flight behaviour. Aggression is employed by animals during intraspecific competition for resources, mate, territory and acquiring and maintaining social status. It also disperses individuals throughout the biotope. Flight behaviour is used to avoid a source of danger or harm, has both dynamic and static forms, is phylogenetically very old and takes precedence over all other activities including social behaviour. Animals exposed to inescapable threats or attacks exhibit a characteristic defensive strategy, arrested flight, which consists of gaze‐avoidance or cut‐offs, cryptic postures such as immobility and covert surveillance of their surroundings. Arrested flight also occurs in social encounters when submission fails to reduce attacks, and in prey animals when escape from a predator is hampered. Ethological studies show that during interviews, depressed patients exhibit a pattern of non‐verbal behaviour having all the hallmarks of arrested flight. Cut‐off behaviour, which seeks to reduce the input of flight‐evoking stimuli is especially evident in these patients but takes an extreme form, i.e. eye closure, in the gaze‐profiles of paranoid patients. It is proposed that cut‐offs always denote the presence of incipient flight and that arrested flight is a ‘last measure’ defensive strategy in response to inescapable proximal threat. It can arise in humans whenever their escape routes are hampered and characterizes the behaviour of patients suffering from depression. As in animals, different pathways may lead to arrested flight in humans. In humans, defensive mechanisms also operate at the mental level through putative ego defences, the psychological function of which is to preserve self‐esteem by hindering the access of disturbing emotional material into awareness. It is suggested that they function ethologically as mental cut‐offs analogous to the behavioural cut‐offs in animals.",

      "abstract": "Jealous love and morbid jealousy, although inextricably linked, cannot be considered the same: jealous love (trait jealousy) is the behavioral and cognitive-affective precondition of morbid jealousy (state jealousy). Love is jealous when it is devoured by the desire for the exclusive and total possession of the partner, whose unconditional and continued presence is avidly requested. This type of love, in addition, is permeated by the need to know what the other is thinking, in order to scrutinize every minimal flaw in the faithfulness of the partner even in his or her innermost thoughts and fantasies; in it, jealousy is virtually always present, even in the absence of a triggering event, because captative love, by its very nature, includes the expectation of a conflict which inevitably actually takes place in reality. Finally, jealousy emerges as an emotional event (jealous flash) in response to a more or less significant change in the behavior of the partner, and reveals to the jealous individual a dimension which was previously latent or inexistent. This intense and brief experience, leaves a more or less blurred memory behind, and tends to progressively repeat itself and take root as a feeling.",

      "abstract": "Communication involves a pair of behaviours—a signal and a response—that are functionally interdependent. Consequently, the emergence of communication involves a chicken-and-egg problem: if signals and responses are dependent on one another, then how does such a relationship emerge in the first place? The empirical literature suggests two solutions to this problem: ritualization and sensory manipulation; and instances of ritualization appear to be more common. However, it is not clear from a theoretical perspective why this should be the case, nor if there are any other routes to communication. Here, we develop an analytical model to examine how communication can emerge. We show that: (i) a state of non-interaction is evolutionarily stable, and so communication will not necessarily emerge even when it is in both parties' interest; (ii) the conditions for sensory manipulation are more stringent than for ritualization, and hence ritualization is likely to be more common; and (iii) communication can arise by a third route, when the intention to communicate can itself be communicated, but this may be limited to humans. More generally, our results demonstrate the utility of a functional approach to communication.",

      "abstract": "Communicative action can be carried out by not only verbal but also embodied means. People regularly use multimodal resources to make sense for each other. Consider a mundane activity, such as a greeting. In addition to the choice of lexical items to fit the relationship, such as “hi,” “yo,” or “good morning, Mister Smith,” extreme prosody featuring high pitch, increased loudness, and extensive lengthening on a “hi” may be necessary for your friend to feel recognized and truly appreciated. In some contexts and relationships, a handshake, a bow, or a hug may be mandatory, while the appropriate duration of those behaviors, the adequate spatial distance, and the exact positions of touch are culturally significant. Across activity settings, bodily behavior is regularly treated as meaningful by coparticipants, as it plays a role in action formation alongside the use of lexicon and grammar. Qualitatively different semiotic resources are juxtaposed so that they mutually elaborate each other and constitute actions within the locally emerging interactional sequences, as understood by the current participants. Aspects such as gaze, gesture, posture, objects, and movement are all potentially recruited to achieve social action, depending on the praxeological context. It is, for example, crucial to pay attention to a specific area in the surrounding space when someone does a pointing gesture or to adjust one’s pace when interacting on the go. We are held socially accountable for our embodied behavior, be it designed for others or not, and the body is constantly interpreted in regard to its action import. Social actions can furthermore be exclusively carried out by the bodies within their spatial, material, and praxeological settings.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Silence is thought of both as an absence (whether desirable or deplorable) and as a lack (indicating a potentially retrievable deficiency). Each dialectically points to its opposite: a presence in the first case, and a sufficiency or an abundance in the second. Absence relates to concepts such as void and nothingness, and is associated with a non-specific invisible and inaudible state. It may be wordlessly sensed or intuited. Identifying putative absences depends on the epistemologies at the disposal of the student of silences. Lack calls attention to a particular incompleteness that can be named. It entails the political unfolding of a process and possesses a teleological undertow. Silence as absence has a different order of inaudibility. As a form of elimination it is itself patently political. Lacanian radical lack has its own peculiarities. It too is non-specific, pertaining to an underlying Real that cannot be articulated or communicated, and for which inadequate terms of language must be substituted. The defective symbolic representation of the Real stands in for an ineluctable lack, a perpetually inexpressible voice. Removal relates to the erasure, loss, or entombment of what had previously existed and was perceptible—often hiding the act of concealment itself, most commonly found in the palimpsests of changing historical narratives.",

The effects of this hearing loss are complicated, being an interplay of physics, psychology, social interaction, etc. Because people are able to adapt, the extent of this “unseen” handicap is underappreciated. Responses by the public to an informative website (http://909ers.apl.washington.edu/∼dushaw/SSD) suggest that this handicap has a universal nature. Obvious effects are the inabilities to locate sound or to bilaterally process sound signals. Less obvious effects are a heightened sensitivity to noise: as masking to a desired signal, as a fatigue factor, as an impediment to mental concentration. The difficulties encountered when talking over the telephone to someone who is speaking in a noisy environment may give one an appreciation of the effects. Even less obvious effects are the long-term social implications of the handicap: the tendency to ignore those on one’s deaf side, the inability to function “normally” at noisy events such as parties, ASA receptions, etc., or a tendency to irritability in noisy environments.

      "abstract": "Empathy is one of the key variables for a healthy and balanced human relationship. Its absence can project the man into the darkest labyrinths of his/her own Self or cause behaviors that tend to annihilate the other. The ability to understand the other, to understand his/her emotional state, to seize his/her cognitive and emotional point of view, through the experiences that he/she lives, means promoting, even for themselves, a program devoted to awareness and to the highest and most noble values. The utilitarian and materialistic vision of the human being has definitively disappeared: its place has been replaced by prospects that put relationship at the center of everything, in the name of educational care, social services and loving that become the prerequisites needed to trigger and encourage a fully empathetic conduct in people training.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive sciences have a necessary interdisciplinary nature due to the fact that no single discipline can do full justice to the complexity of the various issues. The present case considers a young student born without his left hand. People with congenital limb deficiency sometimes experience the movement of their ghosts; they are self-aware of it, even without being embodied by it. The absence of input does not block neural networks from generating messages on the missing parts of the body; they continue to produce such messages that can emotionally unbalance the subject if there’s not an adequate Embodiment Education . Exercise and Sports Sciences also have an interdisciplinary nature; this work presents a modality of intervention for the rehabilitation of a class and a disabled scholar (G) and of the relational dynamics revolving around the phenomenon of disability. One question remains unanswered: can talking about Embodied Cognition and Social Affordance also mean using “the other” or understanding how to “use it”?",

      "title": "PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND PERSONALITY IN CHILDREN1",
      "abstract": "One aspect of the study of individual differences in children which we feel is tremendously important is an appraisal of differences in physiological behavior in response to stress. I use the term stress to include any environmental impact or stimulus, either exogenous or endogenous. The running of the roo-yard dash is, therefore, an example of a physical stress. The initial efforts of a parent to condition a 6-or 7-months-old infant's bowel action is also a stress situation for the infant, in this instance what might be called an emotional stress. The effort of the parent to make the growing child conform in his increasing social and physical contacts to a pattern which is acceptable and not too disturbing to the parents is in reality the application of a whole battery of successively applied stresses to which the child reacts, not only in terms of overt behavior but also with greater or lesser degrees of change in various aspects of body function. The infant who is too abruptly weaned reacts to his frustration not only with anxiety, irritability, and hostility; but also very probably with changes in the peristaltic rate of his intestine; in the vascularity of his kidneys and therefore their rate of excretion; in changes in heart rate, blood pressure, perspiration, and in many other ways. The birth of a little brother or sister into the family may create a very important stress situation for a child, as may entrance to school, or having a fight with the little boy down the street. The whole social and emotional adjustment of the child is accomplished through a series of environmental stresses or impacts, and in response to each of these stresses there may be a greater or lesser degree of modification of many of the biochemical and physiological processes of the body; changes which may be momentary or very prolonged in their nature. They are an integral and highly important part of the behavior of the child as a whole organism in his life situation. They cannot be dissociated from other aspects of his behavior. A knowledge of individual differences in this somatic component of stress response is not only essential for an adequate understanding of social behavior, but it is also essential to the medical man who is responsible for maintaining the health and physical effectiveness of the individual. Perhaps the posing of some of the questions which evolve from a consideration of this field will help you in grasping the scope and significance of an understanding of the physiological components of emotion in response to stress.

Either type may serve to induce cooperation from a self-interested party, subject to several limitations. Shakespeare's King Lear is examined as an instance where benevolence fails to elicit cooperation. To meet the necessary condition for evolutionary survival in competition with rational self-interested players, the emotional party must benefit not only in “feel good” utility terms but in actual material payoff. SILVER RULE, as an instance of reactive passionate behavior related to the familiar TIT FOR TAT behavior, is shown to lose out in evolutionary competition against RATIONAL play unless the SILVER RULE player has a sufficiently high probability of being able to detect when his opponent is a selfish RATIONAL player.",

      "abstract": "Individuals avoid objects that have been in physical contact with morally offensive or disgusting entities. This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

      "abstract": "Play is an important indicator of physical strength, cognitive functioning, and overall welfare for animals. Performed independently or cooperatively, play provides animals, including humans, opportunities to test and practice various physical abilities, social interactions, and object investigations. One area that is often overlooked in animal play is the presence and nature of games. Sometimes considered the social glue of human cultures, games enable participants to practice different moves, cooperatively follow a shared set of rules, and have 'fun.' Using archived footage collected from a stable beluga population in managed care for nearly 15 years, we examined spontaneous, untrained social interactions (i.e. games played) between two or more belugas. Social games encompassed repeated, role exchanges that involved a set of rules developed and shared between the interactants. The belugas engaged in seven different games: locomotor-based games with and without contact, triadic play involving inanimate objects and water, and socio-sexual play. Although most social games involved immature animals, some games did occur with adults. This catalog and description of the variety of games played by belugas will enable us to understand the role social behavior has in behavioral development and individual animal welfare.",

      "abstract": "Mimesis quite often serves as a means of communication between people or animals, and it should be compared with another form of communication, grounded not upon imitation but upon exchange of signs. The very notion of mimesis should be revised in order to re-place the mimesis of representation (artistic or not) by a mimesis of communication which takes place not between two objects (original and copy) but between two or more subjects (independent partners). Mimetic communication differs from the semiotic one by 1) its close, and not distant pragmatics, including in certain cases an im-mediate corporeal contact between partners or even an “excessive mimesis”, that is their identification, 2) a continuous syntactics of its messages, modelled in an analogous rather than in a digital way,3) a prevalence of energy over information in its semantics. These differences may be partly explained through the categories of exempli-fication and denotation, distinguished in analytical philosophy. Although mimesis of communication has not necessarily an aesthetic purpose, it can be observed in literary texts too, combining and making alternate semiotic and mimetic segments and effects.",

From jobs turned down to great loves lost, secrets kept and truths untold, people missed and souls unborn, we understand ourselves through other, unlived lives that are imaginatively possible. This book explores the realm of negative social phenomena – no-things, no-bodies, non-events and no-where places – that lies behind the mirror of experience.\r\n\r\nTaking a symbolic interactionist perspective, the author argues that these objects are socially produced, emerging from and negotiated through our relationships with others. Nothing is interactively accomplished in two ways, through social acts of commission and omission. Existentialism and phenomenology encourage us to understand more deeply the subjective experience of nothing; this can be pursued through conscious meaning-making and reflexive self-awareness.",

Each day individuals were brought together in recurring as well as novel combinations by the gatherings that they were either obligated to attend (by prior commitment, due to their position at the center, etc.) or that they had themselves scheduled and/or organized. What these gatherings had in common was talk; as participants moved from a therapy session to a chat to a meeting, they continually talked to one another. Each one of the typical gatherings at Midwest was characterized by a particular pattern of speech and action as well as group expectations about what constituted \"proper\" speech and action and use of speech on these occasions, and, for the most part, everyone understood the difference between a chat and a meeting or a therapy session and a lecture. The similarities and differences, and sometimes confusion, between these types of gatherings will be discussed in detail in this and subsequent chapters.",

      "abstract": "Rose Edgcumbe’s classic paper has its roots in Freud’s and Anna Freud’s work on the somatic and communication, and she shares with them a keen awareness of the complexity of psychosomatic phenomena across specific cases. It grew out of her earlier papers and two study groups in the Hampstead Clinic concerned with tendencies to “react to specific stimuli with individually specific patterns of cognitive, emotional, behavioral and physiological responses” and with the interaction of constitutional, developmental, and environmental factors in early development in the formation of these patterns. Edgcumbe’s paper delineates normal development, emphasizing the importance of the mother’s capacity to gather together the somatic into the service of communication, first in action and then verbally. This is the foundation on which the infant develops a capacity for mental representation. Where this interaction does not happen or is impaired, owning and being able to symbolize affect may be stunted, and where the environment responds physically at the expense of the verbal, the infant may be inhibited in talking and prioritize body language; or where feelings are “talked away” it might be difficult for the child to be able to use appropriate somatic discharge—crying, for example.",

      "title": "Bonded actions",
      "abstract": "Although all social action is directed at other people, many social actions are initiated by someone who did not perform the action. This form of social action is called bonded action - any action that is not a direct expression of the acting individual's will or decision - anything that someone asks, coerces, or forces another person to say or do. Bonded actions are characterized by the social bonds that hold a relationship together, but the action itself can also be directed at people outside the relationship. That actions are bonded means not only that they are initiated by or together with others within the same relationship; it often means that people are provided with resources to help them perform these actions. People who act on behalf of organizations are transformed into organizational centaurs. Not unlike the mythical centaurs, their individual human features are insufficient to restrain the collective power of which they are a part. Most people are affiliated with several relationships, and they perform different types of bonded actions. In this way, the individual's ability to act is divided, and each piece uses only part of the person's repertoire of actions. Both actions and emotions are divided and exercised as people move from relationship to relationship. The remainder of the chapter is an exploration of the interfaces between bonds and between individuals and their bonds. Some form of casting occurs in most social bonds as a method of creating correspondence between individuals and bonds. The concepts of greedy relationships and emotional labour are also discussed, as is the interface between bonds in such situations as multiple citizenship, whistleblowing, corruption, and match fixing.",

They include a large variety of phenomena, encompassing hearing voices, seeing presences, communication with non-incarnated entities (including channeling), transpersonal experiences, out-of-body experiences, near-death-experiences, previous life memories, presentiments and precognitions, seeing at distance, mind interactions at a distance, mind-matter interactions at distance. We think that individuals experiencing NOMEs should not feel like they were outsiders or diseased; they should feel free to talk about their uncommon experiences and be listen to with an open, not-judging mind, respecting the patients’ experience and narration. In fact, NOMEs are non-pathological phenomena laying in a still misunderstood grey area between mental health and psychological or psychiatric disorders, while some of them suggest intriguing properties of human consciousness. Their ostensible incompatibility with some axioms and theories of consciousness, shows the inescapable epistemological implications of their proper investigation and understanding.",

      "abstract": "Communication comes from the Latin word communicare, meaning to do something general, well-known. In other words, with communication we inform someone about something. There are four basic types of communication: oral communication, written communication, contact or non-verbal communication, e-communication. This paper will focus on nonverbal communication. Nonverbal communication, often called non-verbal behavior or body language, is an instrument of transmitting information, just like a written word. The difference is that it is transmitted through facial expressions, gestures, touches, physical movements, body holding, decoration on the body (clothing, jewelry, hairstyles, tattoos, etc.), and even the volume, tone and colour of certain person voice. Verbal communication is thought to be a better way of presenting the state, thought and feeling, non-verbal communication in its essence should not be underestimated; it is only a more discrete way of expressing emotions and states.",

      "abstract": "Both folk and scientific psychology assume that mental events and properties participate in causal relations. However, considerations involving the causal completeness of physics and the apparent non-reducibility of mental phenomena to physical phenomena have challenged these assumptions. In the case of mental events (such as someone’s thinking about Vienna), one proposal has been simply to identify not ‘types’ (or classes) of mental events with types of physical events, but merely individual ‘token’ mental events with token physical ones, one by one (your and my thinking about Vienna may be ‘realized’ by different type physical states). The role of mental properties (such as ‘being about Vienna’) in causation is more problematic. Properties are widely thought to have three features that seem to render them causally irrelevant: (1) they are ‘multiply-realizable’ (they can be realized in an indefinite variety of substances); (2) many of them seem not to supervene on neurophysiological properties (differences in mental properties do not always depend merely on differences in neurophysiological ones, but upon relations people bear to things outside their skin); and (3) many of them (for example, ‘being painful’) seem inherently ‘subjective’ in a way that no objective physical properties seem to be. All of these issues are complicated by the fact that there is no consensus concerning the nature of causal relevance for properties in general.",

      "title": "Synchrony and sympathy: Social entrainment with music compared to a metronome.",
      "abstract": "We synchronize movements with other individuals in our everyday life (e.g., when shaking hands), in sports (e.g., rowing), or on dancefloors. Especially this last kind of social entrainment can lead to states of pleasure and ecstasy. In some situations, we even unintentionally mirror another person's gestures or movements, for example, when we are walking with another person and the phase of our steps becomes aligned with the other person's steps. Depending on the relationship we have with this person, such a situation can be awkward or pleasant. All of these examples show that movement synchronization and social bonding are tightly linked. In the current study, we examined affiliation and pro-social behavior following a synchronous or asynchronous interpersonal tapping task with music or a metronome.Interpersonal Coordination and MusicInterpersonal coordination-be it behavior matching, such as mimicry, or interactional synchrony, such as simultaneous rhythmic movements (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991)-is a fundamental way to form socioemotional connections. Behavioral mimicry describes the mirroring of another person's gestures, postures, or other movements (e.g., speech gestures, foot shaking; for a review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Factors that increase the tendency to mimic the behavior of another person include pro-social attitudes (Leighton, Bird, Orsini, & Heyes, 2010), being in a good mood (Likowski et al., 2011), and the likability (Stel et al., 2010) or the goal to get along with this person (Lakin & Chartrand, 2003). In turn, being mimicked can positively affect feelings of liking toward the mimicker (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), feelings of interpersonal closeness (Ashton-James, van Baaren, Chartrand, Decety, & Karremans, 2007), and pro-social behavior in adults (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, & van Knippenberg, 2004) and infants (Carpenter, Uebel, & Tomasello, 2013).In contrast to behavioral mimicry that usually includes a time lag of a few seconds, interactional synchrony describes movements that are temporally matched. The social entrainment model of McGrath and Kelly (1986, as cited in Clayton, Sager, & Will, 2004, p. 10) makes the assumption that many human behaviors are oscillatory or rhythmical. The model proposes that the oscillations or rhythms are created endogenously, that the endogenous oscillations or rhythms can become aligned in phase and frequency within an individual and between individuals, and that the temporal patterns of an individual or a group of individuals can become entrained to an external timekeeper. A variety of research suggests that the interpersonal synchronization of movements, such as walking, pendulum-swinging, chair-rocking, body-swaying, or finger-tapping, promotes affiliation and pro-social orientation (Demos, Chaffin, Begosh, Daniels, & Marsh, 2012; Hove & Risen, 2009; Marsh, Richardson, & Schmidt, 2009; Reddish, Fischer, & Bulbulia, 2013; Valdesolo & Desteno, 2011; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009). By using a moving visual timekeeper, Hove and Risen (2009) showed that the degree of synchrony between the participants' and the experimenters' finger-taps was positively related to how much participants liked the experimenter. Such effects may even be stronger when moving together while listening to music: When rocking in a chair with a partner, the degree of synchronization with music is positively correlated with the feeling of interpersonal connectedness (Demos et al., 2012).Listening to music has a strong emotional component and, similarly to social bonding, engages the endogenous opioid system (Tarr, Launay, & Dunbar, 2014). Related to this, Tarr, Launay, and Dunbar (2016) showed that pain thresholds increased after synchronously dancing (i.e., identical movements while listening to the same music) in groups of four. The authors link this effect to the release of endorphins. In contrast, partial synchrony (i. …",

He is unconscious, without heartbeats and breath, and with a flat-line electroencephalogram. NDE may include some of the following elements: Out of the body experiences or separation of consciousness from the physical body, increase in sensory perception and intense emotions, travel into or through a tunnel, encounter with a brilliant light and mystical beings, deceased relatives or friends, a sense of alteration in time and space, visualization of unworldly realms and a special knowledge, encounter with a barrier or boundary, and a return to the body, either voluntary or involuntary. The fact that children NDE are similar to adult NDE is an evidence that these experiences are real and not due to pre-existing beliefs, cultural influences or previous experiences in the present life. The characteristics of NDE are similar worldwide. No evidence supports the physiological, psychological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical hypothesis proposed to explain the NDE. Multifactorial models, based on the combination of all of them (brain anoxia or hypoxia, release of serotonin, endorphins and ketamine-like compounds) have also been proposed. Although physiological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors could interact in the NDE, the hypothesis proposed consist essentially in unsupported speculations about what might be happening during the NDE.",

We know that chimpanzee has all of them. In spite of such chimpanzee's competences, the variety of instrument chimpanzee has invented is very limited comparing to Homo sapiens.Language is a unique tool which make easily possible 1) to represent images of mental experience according to the liguistic codes as social fact, 2) to self-refer modalities of speaker (belief, probability, conditionality etc.) to the talked, 3) to recall propositional believes apparently not relevant to the situation here-and-now and mutually refer between them, 4) to check whether correspond or not with each other the mental images individually supposed by interlocutors. Language, as interface between brain and outer world and between individuals, is very effective tool for communication and inference. Chimpanzee has competence to laugh in playful situation as self-reference of unexpected experience. But it is mostly sure that he does not laugh as a third person.

There are primary or universal emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust), secondary or social emo- tions (compassion, shame, guilt, contempt, jealousy, envy, pride, admiration) and background emotions (wellbeing, malaise, calm, tension). Emotions are complex programs of actions shaped by evolution. The actions are completed by a cognitive program, but the world of emotions is primarily a world of actions carried out in our body from the facial expressions and body positions to the changes in the viscera and internal milieu. We can consider emotion as a primary value system of the brain, leading certain activations to be selectively reinforced. In clinical interviews we are often led from the line of verbal speech to the line of emotional speech. We use our own emotions or feelings as a way to detect discrepancies or incongruities in the relationship, probably between the channels of verbal, non-verbal and empathic communication. Carl Rogers made an important contribution to psychotherapy with his experience of unconditionally accepting the client, who comes to be heard, without prejudice or judgment. A feeling, an emotion, a reasoning were accepted with the same attention, care and respect.

      "title": "Not all perceptual experience is modality specific",
      "abstract": "Humans see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. Episodes of human sensory perceptual experience accordingly are associated with several ways or modes—modalities— of perceiving. Perceptual experiences may be visual, auditory, tactual, olfactory, or gustatory. If there are more or fewer modalities, name them and adjust accordingly. Individual human subjects commonly see and hear at the same time; or hear and smell; or see, hear, and smell; and so on. Most times while you are awake, your perceptual experience is associated with more than one modality. Perceptual experience is, in this minimal respect, multimodal. 1 Recent science demonstrates that the senses do not act merely in parallel or in isolation from each other. Different senses interact and influence each other, and this affects perceptual experience. 2 For instance, cross-modal perceptual illusions occur when stimulation to one sensory system impacts experience associated with another modality in a way that leads to misperception. The ventriloquist effect, for example, is an auditory spatial illusion generated by the visible location of an apparent sound source. It does not follow that perceptual experience fails to remain modality specific. Sensory processes might interact causally while all perceptual experiences nevertheless belong to particular modalities. One sense might causally but not constitutively impact perceptual experience that is associated with another. 1 If it were associated at most with one modality at a time, human perceptual experience at a time instead would be unimodal. See Spence and Bayne (this volume). I resist the unimodal experience view for the following reasons. The view is most plausible if (a) consciousness requires attention and if (b) attention is restricted to a single modality at a time. However, (a) is controversial, and it is possible that we do perceptually experience things that are outside the focus of attention. Even so, there are good arguments for rejecting (b) and holding that attention can range over more than one modality at a time. For instance, it is plausible that there can be multimodal objects of attention (see x2.2; see also, e.g., Karns and Knight 2009). Nevertheless, even rejecting all of this, it is plausible that the temporal grain of the experienced present is coarser than that of conscious shifts between modalities, and that there are no temporal gaps between experiences of distinct modalities, which implies that there are times during which experience is at least minimally multimodal. 2 See O’Callaghan (2012) for extended discussion.",

In diplomacy each party somewhat controls what the other wants, and can get more by compromise, exchange, or collaboration than by taking things in his own hands and ignoring the other's wishes. The bargaining can be polite or rude, entail threats as well as offers, assume a status quo or ignore all rights and privileges, and assume mistrust rather than trust. But whether polite or impolite, constructive or aggressive, respectful or vicious, whether it occurs among friends or antagonists and whether or not there is a basis for trust and goodwill, there must be some common interest, if only in the avoidance of mutual damage, and an awareness of the need to make the other party prefer an outcome acceptable to oneself.",

      "abstract": "In the presented paper, I am making an attempt to demonstrate the most important, in my opinion, characteristics of the language used by people with autism as ones arising directly from disrupted or completely different cognitive processes taking place in their minds. Such individuals lack, in the fi rst place, the fundamental cognitive skill being the awareness of their own and other people’s mental acts. The absence or insuffi ciency of the theory of mind gives rise to disorders in acquiring the linguistic worldview, inability to decode fi gurative meanings, failure to use langue in order to maintain contact, and failure to speak of language itself, and many more. Autistic people are characterised by the metonymic cognitive style, which uses the potential of the so-called systemising skills. Instead of thinking of other people, what to say to them and what should be said to them, people with autism think of the things that do not require familiarity with the theory of mind and are not as complex as humans. Keywords: autism – theory of mind – idiolectal worldview – language functions – metaphor – metonymic cognitive style",

      "title": "Reply to “a non-paternalistic value theory for occupational therapy: a response to Dige”",
      "abstract": "Sandman makes it sound as if I am the one who defends a contentious theory whereas the alternatives, i.e. hedonistic or desire-fulfilment theories, are more uncontroversial or “minimal”. I fail to see this because I find it much more straightforward to say that certain elements of a human life, e.g. accomplishment, personal relationships, and understanding, have a direct or intrinsic value and therefore are something that it is good to enjoy or desire whereas others, e.g. monotony, isolation, and confusion, have a direct or intrinsic disvalue and therefore are something that is not worth enjoying or desiring. It is not entirely clear whether Sandman wants to challenge the view that activity is intrinsically better than passivity or the view that specific types of activities (e.g. those involving personal relationships, understanding, and accomplishment) are objectively better than others in the sense that they constitute genuine, intrinsic values. The first point is easily misunderstood. The claim that activity is intrinsically good does not imply an ideal of hyperactivity and extreme sports. Sandman’s examples of rather monotonous and mindless activities (playing Tetris and “ordering, reordering and ordering again a set of differently coloured pens”) are interesting only if they more or less take up all the person’s time. Most of us use a considerable amount of time on activities like that (for better or worse). It becomes a professional (OT) challenge only if the person seems incapable of enjoying or desiring anything else and I have a hard time imagining a responsible occupational therapist who would accept a life of total passivity (taking part in no challenging or social or self-involving activities whatsoever) as a possible ideal life. The second point is a matter of considerable philosophical controversy and it would be overly ambitious to try to settle it definitively. Hence, apart from what I have said in the original article, I will just offer an example for consideration. Imagine a child in an elementary school who exclaims: “But I do not want to come to understand maths or grammar or anything else at all and I do not want to interact with you teachers and the other children and I do not want to make school work my own accomplishment!” That would certainly be a pedagogic challenge but I think it would take a lot more than this to make it a challenge to our belief in these values. On the contrary, it would simply be unprofessional if the schoolteachers reassessed their mission and value commitments to the effect that they gave up on teaching maths to those who did not want it, allowed the antisocial children to be left alone, and so on. Quite another but very important consideration is that we sometimes have to settle for something short of the ideal. Imagine for example that the child suffers from social phobia and gets extremely anxious when",

Human reality is the social reality of one's fellow-creatures. It is always rooted in the corporeal, the soma which is the manifestation within the individual of the unity of physis, bios, and mind. This complex manifestation (or gestalt in a broader sense) is unstable. It must be maintained by means of a constant supply of emotional stimuli, which is aesthetically mediated by communicative intercourse. Schizophrenia signifies the rupture of interpersonal relationships, a breakdown in the process of emotional refuelling. A marked diminution of clear contours in physiognomic manifestations also has somatically perceivable consequences in the case of the chronically ill. Not only does gestalt thus help form the basis of relationships; relationships, for their part, are instrumental in shaping gestalt.",

      "title": "Language and theory of mind in atypically developing children",
      "abstract": "Language and theory of mind are two essential human capacities that can be considered as the culmination of an evolutionary process. Through language, we converse about our culture and transmit knowledge across generations about the nature of the mental and physical worlds. Communication between people can take place more rapidly when they converse together in a language governed by grammatical rules than through direct observation, facial or bodily signals, pictorial media, or other non-linguistic formats. In this sense, conversation is evolutionarily adaptive as it provides an efficient means to communicate feedback about potentially threatening events that are remote in time and space (Dunbar 1993).A second essential human characteristic seems inextricably linked to language and conversation (Astington 2000; Harris 2005). This is possession of a theory of mind (ToM) which permits us to reason about the mental states of others—their beliefs, desires, and intentions—and to understand and anticipate how these differ from our own. A lack of ToM would be a formidable obstacle to all sophisticated forms of human social interaction, including family cohesion and close relationships. Without the recognition that beliefs can be true or false, there would exist a constant state of misunderstanding, mistrust, and conflict. Moreover, without ToM reasoning, we would be unable to appreciate many of the hallmarks of human culture. Events portrayed in novels, drama, and song would be meaningless as these often rely on the recognition that persons have been misled by their false beliefs. Indeed, given its importance, ToM has come to dominate the study of social cognition in typically and atypically developing children over the past 20 years (Flavell 2004).As there are children whose language acquisition is jeopardized because their hearing or vision is impaired, a key issue that arises concerns the effects of disruptions of the typical course of language acquisition on the expression of ToM reasoning. In this chapter, we discuss how sensory impairments can jeopardize the language acquisition and conversational understanding that may play crucial roles for ToM. We examine these issues in relation to the social cognition of typically and atypically developing children, such as children who are deaf or blind or who may be suffering from autism. As such, upon finishing the chapter, the reader will not only be familiar with the role of language in the development of social cognitive deficits associated with deafness, blindness, and autism, but also the role of language in typically developing social cognition.",

One possibility is that these gestures are just conditioned responses without any understanding of the socio-cognitive causality underlying their efficacy. A second possibility is that they do involve some understanding of how they are (or fail to be) effective upon the behaviour of others. Observational evidence suggest that most apes and some monkeys coordinate their request gestures with joint attention behaviours — a criterion for early referential communication in human infants. However, experimental evidence about apes and monkeys‘ understanding of the causal role of joint attention in gestural communication is equivocal, with test pass and failure patterns that can be due to cognitive and/or motivational factors. Current evidence suggests that the gestures of apes and monkeys can neither be dismissed as simple conditioned responses nor be uncritically accepted as fully equivalent to human gestures.",

Relationship systems can be defined as what goes on between or among people. In helping bereaved people who talk about systemic loss it is important to acknowledge and speak to that aspect of their loss and, if appropriate, to support them in finding ways to move forward in addressing their systemic losses. Failure to acknowledge and stay with a bereaved person’s words about systemic loss and instead to slide into talking about, for example, grief feelings could be taken as a lack of death competence and an empathic failure. The paper provides illustrations regarding systemic losses in the area of roles, including losses in the areas of collaboration in defining realities, memory-sharing, and mutual knowing and being known.",

In the context of animal welfare, cascades have often occurred, and more consequential ones are possible. First: In this domain, preference falsification has run and is running rampant. Those who care about animal welfare, or are inclined to want to say or do something about it, often silence themselves. They know that if they speak or act, they might incur social disapproval or worse. Second: People have different thresholds for disclosing their views or for taking action. With respect to animal welfare, some people really will speak out or act, even if no one else does. Others need someone to follow – but only one. Still others need two, or three, or a hundred, or more. Third: Social interactions are and continue to be crucial to the movement for animal welfare. Who is seeing whom? When? Who is talking to whom? Are visible people speaking and acting in ways that support animal welfare? Are they credible? With whom? Fourth: In many times and places, believers in animal rights, animal welfare, or both have created communities of like-minded people. These communities can be highly effective. They create a commitment to a belief that might have been held tentatively. They make that belief salient, potentially part of people’s identity. They increase confidence and unity.",

Many would argue that ritual is not simply one of many modes of communication available to humans but the one that has made other sorts of human communication possible, particularly those resting on language. Although popular understanding tends to associate ritual with the concerns or practice of religion, a fundamental aspect of the definition offered here is that it does not stipulate ritual’s subject matter. Ritual is understood to be a form or structure, that is, a number of features or characteristics in a more or less fixed relationship to one another. Events conforming to this definition occur outside religious contexts. Psychiatrists, for instance, have used the terms ritual and ceremony to refer both to the pathological behavior of obsessive-compulsives and to the healthy but stereotyped interactions between parents and children. In fact, usage does not have to be confined to the human species. Ethologists use the term to designate stereotypic dis plays through which members of a very large number of species communicate with their conspecifics (for example, the courtship rituals of great-crested grebes or fiddler crabs).",

      "abstract": "Virtuous violence theory proposes that the perpetrator intends to harm or kill in order to constitute a social relationship to make it correspond with a prescriptive model of what the relationship ought to be – what it must be made to be. For our purposes, a social relationship consists of complementarity between the actions of the participants: each participant’s actions fit previous actions by the other and presuppose “fitting” actions by the other(s), such that the actions of each are incomplete without the congruent action by the other(s). That is, the acts of each are part of a whole that none of them can bring off alone. We encompass in the terms “act” and “actions” not simply the morphology of movements, but also, crucially, the participant’s intentions, moral judgments, and motives (often consciously experienced as emotions). Furthermore, each participant implicitly or explicitly aims to induce completion of her acts: she intends to motivationally evoke and morally invoke the congruent actions that will complete or dynamically sustain the jointly constructed pattern. That is, a participant expects the other(s) to do their part, in the predictive sense, in the hopeful sense, and in the evaluative sense of judging the others’ actions according to how well they complete the intended gestalt.

The anomie-deviance hypothesis is about steady state behavior, the stable rates that occur after people have had a chance to learn what reinforcement contingencies are in effect in a social system. In the short run, people may be inaccurate about reinforcement contingencies. Hamblin, et al. shows that deviant behavior is routinely supported by pathogenic exchanges.

      "title": "Do infants and nonhuman animals attribute mental states?",
      "abstract": "Among psychologists, it is widely thought that infants well under age 3, monkeys, apes, birds, and dogs have been shown to have rudimentary capacities for representing and attributing mental states or relations. I believe this view to be mistaken. It rests on overinterpreting experiments. It also often rests on assuming that one must choose between taking these individuals to be mentalists and taking them to be behaviorists. This assumption underestimates a powerful nonmentalistic, nonbehavioristic explanatory scheme that centers on attributing action with targets and on causation of action by interlocking, internal conative, and sensory states. Neither action with targets, nor conative states, nor sensing entails mentality. The scheme can attribute conative states and relations (to targets), efficiency, sensory states and relations (to sensed entities), sensory retention, sensory anticipation, affect, and appreciation of individual differences. The scheme can ground explanations of false belief tests that do not require infants or nonhuman animals to use language. After the scheme is explained and applied, it is contrasted with other, superficially similar schemes proposed in the literature-for example, those of Gergely and Csibra, Wellman and Gopnik, Perner and Roessler, Flavell, and Apperly and Butterfill.

      "title": "STUDIES INDICATING THE FUNCTION OF CORTIN*†",
      "abstract": "There are three lines of approach to the study of the function of cortin the vital hormone of the adrenal cortex; one, through the effects of deprivation, a second through the effects of replacement in deficient subjects, and the third through the action of cortin in normal subjects. The most striking results occur when there is a deficiency of the hormone. In experimental adrenal insufficiency symptoms develop which indicate marked changes in the functions of many tissues of the body. Animals with both adrenals removed not only become fatigued easily when they undertake exercise, but they show a disinclination for exercise. Loss of appetite appears sooner or later, with or without vomiting, and there may be hemorrhages from the mueosa of the alimentary canal or elsewhere. As the animals become worse, they lose interest in their surroundings, finally passing into a state of inertia which verges upon coma or they become easily irritated and may appear irrational (wandering about aimlessly from one place to another without being satisfied anywhere), finally passing into coma, from which they are roused with difficulty. Just preceding or alternating with coma, twitching, heightened motor activity, and even convulsions sometimes occur. The blood urea rises and the blood sugar may fall. Although the changes seem to be coming on gradually, collapse may occur suddenly. In addition to the symptoms described for animals, in man other symptoms evident are pain in the legs, back or abdomen; insomnia and mental depression; poor judgment; failure of memory and lack of cooperation. With the administration of cortin the symptoms tend to disappear in the reverse order of their appearance; coma being replaced by heightened muscular irritability, as shown by increased motor activity, aimless movements, twitching and marked myotatic response to stimuli.",

      "title": "Adjustment Mechanism에 관한 心理的 考察",
      "abstract": "Man cannot adapt himself to the complicated environment only with the physical equilibrium created through the physiological or biological processes of growth. However, it is possible for him to adapt himself well to the environment, when the psychological equilibrium be formed on the basis of biological equilibrium. Man acts in various ways in order to maintain such equilibrium. Personality develops itself into a new form through adjustment to the environment, and also through creating a new environment. Human needs should be met adequately to achieve the desirable adaptation to the environment through the continuos processes of control and creation for adjustment. When human needs not be met or met to excess, an emotional instability would result, that is the cause of maladjustment. Psychological mechanism is used to overcome emotional needs and tensions, while anatomical mechanism isused to protect the organization of human body from maladjustment. Especially psychological mechanism appears differently according to the individual; as it were, it appears as the from of mechanisms, of escape, defense, and aggressiveness. Among these there are those accepted socially and those rejected socially. The Mechanisms accepted socially lead to the low level of personality development. Therefore, guidance programs should be made so that pupils may not take the unacceptable mehcanisms.\r\n The following methods are recommended to guide pupils in terms of adjustment mechanism:\r\n 1. To eliminate factors for frustration through controlling conditions of envioronments.\r\n 2. To give the opportunities to evaluate himself, so that he may know whether or not behaviors to meet his needs be acceptable sociallly.\r\n 3. To train perseverance in case the pupil be frustrated psychologically.\r\n 4. To foster ability to determine the adequate standard of psychological needs.",

      "title": "What does it mean to be humane?",
      "abstract": "JAVMA, Vol 240, No. 5, March 1, 2012 C and misunderstanding often occur when two people attempt to communicate using different languages. More commonly, confusion arises when two people attempt to communicate using the same language but attach different meanings to the same terms. A good example is the term humane, particularly as it relates to whether the care we provide as veterinarians is humane. The term humane encompasses the best qualities of humankind, including kindness, tenderness, empathy, and compassion. Although all of these behaviors exist to some extent in various animals, animals cannot act in a humane fashion (that is, animal behavior is not judged as humane or inhumane), whereas humans can act in a humane fashion toward other humans and animals. Behavior that is inhumane is lacking in compassion for the suffering of humans and animals; synonyms of inhumanity include unkindness and cruelty. Thus, a veterinarian or animal owner who deliberately chooses to disregard available means to reduce injury or illness in an animal under his or her care could be thought of as inhumane or, in some circumstances, cruel. The definition of cruelty encompasses actions that are inhumane and without pity. The definition of pity encompasses having compassion for the suffering, distress, or troubles of another. Whether an act is cruel depends not only on the act itself, but also on the intent of the act. In my opinion, cruelty involves acts and motivations limited to people. The term welfare signifies a state of being or doing well. The concept of animal welfare has traditionally been founded on the premise that humans have an obligation to act humanely toward animals. In my experience, animal welfare problems are more likely to encompass acts of omission rather than commission (ie, deliberate acts of cruelty). The term compassion is derived from Latin and literally means to suffer with. Thus, compassion encompasses feelings, but more is involved with compassion than simply emotions. According to several modern English dictionaries, two complementary human qualities must be combined to be compassionate. First, we must have empathetic awareness of the suffering, distress, or troubles of another living being. Second, we must have an empathetic desire to help correct the problem. Empathy is the projection of our own thoughts and feelings onto the thoughts and feelings of What does it mean to be humane?",

In particular, it will be argued that shared sensorimotor experience as to the interaction with basic‐level objects like hammers, shelves, or bicycles facilitates the interpretation of the respective verbs even in the absence of a referent. Concepts related to the agent either provide mental access to habitual activities ( to nurse at St. Mary's ) or establish metaphorical readings on the basis of perceived similarity (e.g. to Sherlock Holmes , to sea‐lion ).",

      "abstract": "This paper gives us an understanding that we cannot not communicate. In our lives, whether intentionally or unintentionally, we have communicated with the people around us from the moment we are born until we die. Communication is the process of understanding each other's meaning between two fellow humans. Communication occurs when a person's behaviour has been interpreted by others to give meaning to that person's behaviour. That is, we are considered to have communicated if our behavior has been interpreted by others even though we do not intend to convey any message to him. Thus, we cannot avoid communication.The thought that we cannot not communicate can be understood because in communication there are principles of communication, namely: the core content of communication is meaning; meaning is the result of interpretation of behaviour; communication has occurred if someone has interpreted the behaviour of others, both verbal behaviour and nonverbal behaviour, regardless of whether the person is aware or not aware of it; and we cannot control others to interpret or not interpret our behaviour.Communication behaviour can be unintentional or intentional behaviour. Deliberation is not a requirement for communication. Every behavior has communication potential. In everyday life, in the midst of communication that we consciously do, often tucked into communication behaviour that we are not aware of or unintentional.",

Ambivalence is believed to be intensifying in society, resulting in inhibited growth and impaired decision-making. Researchers assert that humans utilize two basic forms of coping with ambivalence: emotionfocused and problem-focused. With emotion-focused coping, humans avoid, procrastinate, or downplay the significance of situations (i.e., valence-carriers); humans may feel relieved superficially, yet dilemmas remain unresolved [2]. With problem-focused coping, humans seek information and weigh the pros/ cons of alternatives (i.e., valence-carriers); humans invest time and cognitive effort to maximize confidence for the best possible decisions. In contrast to emotion-focused coping, our community excavates dichotomies; we probe ambivalenceinduced discomforts. Our contributors explored a variety of valence carriers.",

      "abstract": "(1872), the nonverbal 'language of the emotions' has been a vital research area. In fact, emotions and attitudes are mainly expressed by the use of the nonverbal channel. These functions are not as easily expressed by means of the verbal language. Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1970:462 states that To communicate emotions we do not necessarily require language even today, because our innate expressive behaviour repertoire is quite sufficient. The verbal language, in contrast, has its main function in communicating events and thoughts, i.e. the referential function. One of the characteristics of human verbal language is that it allows the communication of events outside the immediate context of the 'here and now'. Emotions are evoked by some sort of stimulus. Emotions typically occur in social situations, where humans interact and/or react on stimuli. In social interaction, 'body language' (facial expression, gestures, posture, touching etc.) and vocal signs (tone quality, prosody, cries, laughter etc.) are important means of communication for humans as well as for other social species. One example of the inferiority of the verbal channel in communicating emotions is that when the verbal content conflicts with the nonverbal message the verbal message is ignored, and people trust the nonverbal signal (see",

      "abstract": "Domesticated animals display distinct differences in behavior, morphology, and physiology from their wild counterparts. They usually exhibit reduced aggressiveness, increased social tolerance among conspecifics, and reduced sensitivity to environmental changes (for review, see Sachser 1998; Price 2002). The complex suite of modified social behaviors and cognitive abilities that results from domestication specifically includes tameness, the ability to interact with humans in a positive way. An understanding of the genetics of tameness in canids should provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying social behavior in canids and other species, and into the broader phenomenon of domestication as a whole. Herein, we discuss strategies for identification of the genetic roots of tame behavior in canids. For the purposes of this chapter, we refer to this friendly, dog-like behavior as tameness. The mutual ability of dogs and humans to communicate, and to interact socially with each other, is so commonplace that it is often not recognized for how strange a phenomenon it represents. The sentiment “She is almost human—just cannot speak” would be immediately understood by anyone familiar with the relationship between dogs and their human companions. Without a word from them, we understand our dogs very well. We can read their body language, facial expressions, habits, and emotional states; and they can read ours. They can understand our mood, intent, tone of voice, and words from our language. Sometimes it is hard to credit that the modern dog ( Canis familiaris ) is such a recent and close relative of the gray wolf...",

How people arrange their bodies and how they orient them and place them in relation to each other or to features in the environment, provides important information about how they are engaged with one another and about the nature of their intentions and attitudes. Activities in which objects in the environment are being manipulated, modified or rearranged, are indispensable for grasping a person's aims and goals and interests. Of equal importance, however, are actions that are seen to be purely expressive. Here we find those configurations of action in the face and body that appear as displays of feeling and emotion, as well as actions that often play a central role in the accomplishment of important moments in social interaction. Greeting, showing gratitude or affection, challenge, threat, submission, compliance, all are accomplished through a range of different expressive actions.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the question of how and with what consequences anonymity is used as a creative element in experiments dealing with alternative forms of knowledge production. More specifically, the focus is on a particular current in contemporary dance, experimental dance. This has developed in the course of the 1970s. Its guiding idea is to shift the focus away from finished choreography and performance to the processuality, spontaneity, and experience of dance practice itself. Dance is seen as a laboratory in which to experiment with gravity, body boundaries, group dynamics and perception. The focus is on testing, touching, trying. The corresponding events are called either 'Dance Labs' or 'Movement Research Workshops', depending on the regularity. An instrument that is often used in the context of such events to create specific social situations and group dynamics or to channel perceptions in certain directions is anonymity. Anonymity is broadly understood as the capping of connections that results in a degree of unaccountability with respect to various aspects of a person, situation, or activity. For example, unaccountability can arise from the fact that people can no longer see each other, so that visual identification becomes impossible, even if only temporarily. By breaking familiar modes of identification, other forms of relating can sometimes be emphasized. This is what makes this form of anonymity so interesting for experimental dance.",

The exceptional cases are where the event or state denotes a personal feeling on the part of the addressee (or addresser, in some cases).

      "abstract": "Abstract Ethologists and comparative psychologists have found that the social behavior, discrimination learning, and especially the communicative behavior of many animals are sufficiently versatile to call into question the customary denial that animals have mental experiences comparable to our own. Many of their behavior patterns suggest that animals have mental images of objects, events, or relationships remote from the immediate stimulus situation, as well as self-awareness and intentions concerning future actions. Our behavioristic Zeitgeist has inhibited investigation of such possibilities, but reopening these long-neglected questions requires no departure from the materialistic approach to biological and behavioral science. The basic question at issue involves a comparison of those aspects of human and nonhuman brain function that sometimes lead to what we call mental experiences, at least in our own species. It seems more feasible to devise objectively verifiable tests for the existence of these general categories of mental experiences than for that of many others. While many other kinds of evidence could well be used (with appropriate caution and all possible controls) to weigh the likelihood that animals sometimes know what they are doing, the experimental use of communicative behavior seems especially promising, because the latter could serve a function analogous to human language, which provides our best evidence about the mental experiences of our fellow men.",

In this article, we (1) show how persons in LIS are being locked out, including how key issues addressed in the existing literature on ethics, LIS, and BCIs for communication, such as autonomy, quality of life, and advance directives, may reinforce these confinements; (2) show how these practices violate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and suggest that we have a moral responsibility to prevent and stop this exclusion; and (3) discuss the role of BCIs for communication as one means to this end and suggest that a novel approach to BCI research is necessary to acknowledge the moral responsibility toward the end users and avoid violating the human rights of persons in LIS.",

      "title": "Lost in the Socially Extended Mind",
      "abstract": "Much of the characteristic symptomatology of schizophrenia can be understood as resulting from a pervasive sense of disembodiment. The body is experienced as an external machine that needs to be controlled with explicit intentional commands, which in turn leads to severe difficulties in interacting with the world in a fluid and intuitive manner. In consequence, there is a characteristic dissociality: others become problems to be solved by intellectual effort and no longer present opportunities for spontaneous interpersonal alignment. This leads to a loss of the socially extended mind, which normally affords opportunities for co-regulation of cognitive and affective processes. However, at times people with schizophrenia report that they experience the opposite of dissociality, namely, an unusual fluidity of the self-other boundary as expressed in experiences of ambiguous body boundaries, intrusions, and even merging with others. Here, the person has not lost access to the socially extended mind but has instead become lost in it, possibly due to a weakened sense of self. We argue that this neglected aspect of schizophrenic social dysfunction can be usefully approached via the concept of genuine intersubjectivity: we normally participate in a shared experience with another person by implicitly co-regulating how our interaction unfolds. This integrates our respective experiences' dynamical bases and gives the interaction an ambiguous second-person character. The upshot is that reports of abnormal self-other fluidity are not indicative of hallucinations without any basis in reality, but of a heightened sensitivity and vulnerability to processes of interpersonal alignment and mutual incorporation that form the normal basis of social life. We conclude by discussing implications of this view for both the science of consciousness as well as approaches to intervention and therapy.",

      "title": "[Psychoanalytic aspects of depression, including mania].",
      "abstract": "The narcissistic emptiness respectively depletion in depression with the consecutive deficient narcissistic cathexis of ego, id, superego as well as of the body leads to the fact that the people concerned lose all the pleasureful freshness which healthy persons have, but are also unable to build up or to maintain a communicative object relation. On the one hand depressives have the desire to incorporate and to possess in a compensatory-fusionary way objects and on the other hand, since the objects lose by this their object character, they fear them at the same time. Partners of depressives experience themselves often as being totally in their hands respectively \"devoured\" by them. How so ever the fusion of the depressives might be, they always suffer from the impression having lost their self as well as the objects. Submitted to their narcissistically uncathected archaic superego, depressives are strictly directed towards law and order. An individual who is not able to accept himself in such a way, has also no possibility for an object love since the basis of each object relation is always the enlargement of the self onto the object and only on this basis an identification can be realized. Due to a narcissistically insufficient cathexis of the body respectively of certain body functions, pains are often experienced, whereby it may happen that the pain experience represents the depression itself. Due to this narcissistic deficiency the depressive considers himself to be outside any social relationships. The depressive suffers therefore not only from the lost self but also from the object from which he feels estranged. In mania however the people concerned succeed to have the enthralling experience of a compensatory grandioe self and of the fusion with the object. Why this defense against the narcissistic emptiness respectively depletion is possible, even when admitting a genetic predisposition, must still be clarified.",

      "abstract": "Individuals’ interaction with the external world is almost always influenced by their clothing, whether through personal choice, their “habitus”, dress codes, etc., through shaping how other view/interact with them, influencing their understanding of their identity, and conversely of influencing how others view them though how they dress. As a result of this, different clothing styles can evoke different connotations based on the viewers assumption of the ideals of the groups or contexts that the wearer’s clothing connects them to, such as formal office dress and LGBTQ+ fashions, whether by choice or by pressure. Also, through dress individuals can internalize these ideals of the group, to influence their view of themselves, and in turn how they interact with the outside world. Furthermore, clothing can also highlight a person’s individuality through failure to conform, evoking a different individual-world interaction. Regardless, an individual’s desire to express themselves and externalize the internal can lead to clothing construction or altering to better represent themselves, and/or their relationship to a group.",

Like other break-away behaviors, we understand these as corporeal embodiments anchored, in both form and substance, more on the side of psychic productions than passages-to-the-act that are known to short-circuit thinking. These behaviors are linked in part to a conscious intent that embodies the erasure, or emptying of inner tensions out of oneself, “getting a handle on them,” which is synonymous with control, the transposition of psychic suffering into palpable, visible percepts and the attempt to have an effect on people around the adolescent, in order to obtain recognition and favorable rearrangements. They are also unconscious and very condensed, carrying out attempts at figuration which give form and substance to psychic representations that the subject suffering in his identity tries to avoid or cover up. Most of the adolescents in question cannot put this suffering into words. In order to prepare them for psychic work, we think it is necessary to gradually ally emotion with representation and act with speech. This can be through therapeutic acts able to foster re-binding, offered as supports to figuration. We give some examples from the experience of our staff, which for the past 15 years has been organizing brief hospital stays for suicidal youths in a specialized unit.",

Identity defines the emotional attitude towards other people (their ‘own’ or ‘alien’), towards the social and natural environment, towards the world as a whole. On the other hand, the emotional attitude determines the identity. This attitude could be spontaneously occurring, but very often it is culturally conditioned, and purposefully designed. Postulates of national identity can take the form of imperatives like „Love your motherland!” Very often they are formulated in another way that replaces the imperative with allegations expressed by claims in first person (single or plural) or in impersonal form. Such statements are similar and operate as spells. The ambivalent attitude to the ‘own’ contains some negative elements. Their designation may indicate a trauma, frustration caused by some kind of insufficiency (including a lack of heroic deeds), inferiority complex. Trauma and shame can be pushed to the unconscious, but can also be productive as a cohesive element and as search for compensatory actions or verbal structures.",

The expression is used interchangeably with the term, grief; which is descriptive in essence, often articulated as a series of psychological, physical, behavioural and emotional responses. Grief is also used more broadly than bereavement, incorporating other losses an individual may experience over a lifespan (Zisook & Shear, 2009). It cannot be disputed both terms appear with some inconsistency within literature; however this editorial will refer to bereavement as an emotional state experienced after a death and grief as a process.\n\nThe emotional and sometimes physical pain experienced after a death will be different for everybody; with no correct formulae on how to feel or what to do once a loss is experienced. Although similar responses will occur amongst individuals, no two experiences will be exactly the same, so comparisons are futile as factors such as personality, mental health, coping skills, support systems, the nature of the relationship with the deceased person, the experience of illness, how the disease progressed and time frames will all play a contributing role (Australian Centre for Grief and Bereavement, 2015).",

Everyone recognizes emotions such as fear, sadness, happiness, love, and hatred in other non-verbal communication. Words are rarely needed to express those feelings. People often send messages without using words. Studies show that up to 65 percent of what is being communicated is non-verbal communication. Exercising the ability to use and understanding body language is one of the most important ways to improve negotiation skills. The smart negotiator recognizes things like resistance, boredom, and nervousness, that is, all that can endanger negotiations. Non-verbal communication contains the entire body language, including appearance and attitude as a form of communication with others. Rather than using words, people can communicate using nonverbal gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact. Also, an individual's voice can communicate nonverbal messages with others. At work, people interact with each other during the working day using verbal and nonverbal communication. The paper presents examples of two cultures and their nonverbal communication. These are two completely different cultures, or one culture of high context - China, and one culture of low context - Germany.",

If delusions are adaptations to social exclusion, then they should onset when an individual faces a serious social threat, they should function (in ancestral type environments) to prevent exclusion-at least in the short term-and they should cease when the social threat ceases, an hypothesis which is examined in the context of numerous published studies of Delusional Disorder (DD).",

      "abstract": "People across the world make requests every day. We constantly rely on others to get by in the small and big practicalities of everyday life, be it getting the salt, moving a sofa, or cooking a meal. It has long been noticed that when we ask others for help we use a wide range of forms drawing on various resources afforded by our language and body. To get another to pass the salt, for example, we may say ‘Pass the salt’, or ask ‘Can you pass me the salt?’, or simply point to the salt. What do different forms of requesting give us? The short answer is that they allow us to manage different social relations. But what kind of relations? While prior research has mostly emphasised the role of long-term asymmetries like people’s social distance and relative power, this thesis puts at centre stage social relations and dimensions emerging in the moment-by-moment flow of everyday interaction. These include how easy or hard the action requested is to anticipate for the requestee, whether the action requested contributes to a joint project or serves an individual one, whether the requestee may be unwilling to do it, and how obvious or equivocal it is that a certain person or another should be involved in the action. The study focuses on requests made in everyday informal interactions among speakers of Italian. It involves over 500 instances of requests sampled from a diverse corpus of video recordings, and draws on methods from conversation analysis, linguistics and multimodal analysis. A qualitative analysis of the data is supported by quantitative measures of the distribution of linguistic and interactional features, and by the use of inferential statistics to test the generalizability of some of the patterns observed. The thesis aims to contribute to our understanding of both language and social interaction by showing that forms of requesting constitute a system, organised by a set of recurrent social-interactional concerns",

A notable issue is that of gift refusal, the possibility of refusing a gift in totality or in part, and its consequences. This can apply to the initial gift, to the return gift, or to both. The issue of gift refusal is disregarded in this section for simplicity and because, in a number of cases, it does not matter, or does not occur, or even cannot occur. (It may be that the agents do not refuse because they appreciate the other's gift, or only the gifts offered matter, or refusing the gift or returning it back may not be possible for a material reason or because of a norm internalized or imposed by social pressure, or the giver may be able to refuse the refusal – for instance in not “taking back” something refused –, and so on).",

Co-speech facial gestures include facial configurations as well as movements or positions of the head and gaze. It is essential to distinguish between co-speech gestures and nonverbal communication. Nonverbal communication is by definition any behavior or state that is independent of speech; it is often characterized as a separate channel of information. In contrast, co-speech gestures are by definition closely synchronized with speech in both their timing and their meaning. The meaning of a nonverbal communication relies on expert inference or ratings by other observers and is usually about attitudes, feelings, personality, and other characteristics of an individual. The meaning of a co-speech act is what it explicitly portrays to the person to whom it is addressed in the context of the immediately accompanying words and ongoing conversation.",

      "title": "Do toddlers reason about other people’s experiences of objects? A limit to early mental state reasoning",
      "abstract": "Human social life requires an understanding of the mental states of one’s social partners. Two people who look at the same objects often experience them differently, as a twinkling light or a planet, a 6 or a 9, and a random cat or Cleo, their pet. Indeed, a primary purpose of communication is to share distinctive experiences of objects or events. Here, we test whether toddlers (14-15 months) are sensitive to another agent’s distinctive experiences of pictures when determining the goal underlying the agent’s actions in a minimally social context. Across seven experiments (n = 206), toddlers viewed either videotaped or live events in which an actor, whose perspective differed from their own, reached (i) for pictures of human faces that were upright or inverted or (ii) for pictures that depicted a rabbit or a duck at different orientations. Then either the actor or the toddler moved to a new location that aligned their perspectives, and the actor alternately reached to each of the two pictures. By comparing toddlers’ looking to the latter reaches, we tested whether their goal attributions accorded with the actor’s experience of the pictures, with their own experience of the pictures, or with no consistency. In no experiment did toddlers encode the actor’s goal in accord with his experiences of the pictures. In contrast, in a similar experiment that manipulated the visibility of a picture rather than the experience that it elicited, toddlers (n = 32) correctly expected the actor’s action to depend on what was visible and occluded to him, rather than to themselves. In a verbal version of the tasks, older children (n = 35) correctly inferred the actor’s goal in both cases. These findings provide further evidence for a dissociation between two kinds of mental state reasoning: When toddlers view an actor’s object-directed action under minimally social conditions, they take account of the actor’s visual access to the object but not the actor’s distinctive experience of the object.",

      "abstract": "The classical Simon effect shows that actions are carried out faster if they spatially correspond to the stimulus signaling them. Recent studies revealed that this is the case even when the two actions are carried out by different people; this finding has been taken to imply that task representations are socially shared. In work described here, we found that the \"interactive\" Simon effect occurs only if actor and coactor are involved in a positive relationship (induced by a friendly-acting, cooperative confederate), but not if they are involved in a negative relationship (induced by an intimidating, competitive confederate). This result suggests that agents can represent self-generated and other-generated actions separately, but tend to relate or integrate these representations if the personal relationship between self and other has a positive valence.",

      "abstract": "Literacy is commonly defined as a person's ability to read and write, and illiteracy the inability to read and write, but a true understanding of literacy, and illiteracy, is much more complex than such a simple dichotomy implies. For instance, if one is able to write one's own name, but unable to fill out a job application because he or she does not understand the words 'previous' or 'experience', is that person considered literate or illiterate? How much reading and writing ability must one possess before one can be considered literate? Questions such as this gave birth to the term functional literacy. Functional Literacy refers to one's ability to use language skills to cope with every day demands (IL Y, 1990). In other words, if one's ability to read and write is so limited that it prevents him or her from functioning in society, e.g. purchasing goods, reading a bus schedule or following instructions on a medicine bottle, then that person is by definition, functionally illiterate.

      "title": "THE PROBLEM OF COMMUNICATION",
      "abstract": "The terms in which this essay is written, and the examples used to illustrate various points, are for the most part not specifically Catholic. One reason for this is a desire to present the problem in the idiom of the world with which Catholics want, or should want, to communicate, since they exist partly for its sake. It looks as though the most primitive forms of communication were non-conscious and non-voluntary. Investigators working on animal communications as they are found in such creatures as sticklebacks, and even in more highly developed beasts like ducks, believe the evidence warrants their assuming that both stimulus and response as shown, for instance in patterns of aggression or mating behaviour, are almost automatic. Investigators conditioned by methods of modem scientific research are of course prone to believe in automatism, since it is a concept which makes their task of abstraction and generalization very much easier than would ideas of spontaneity and of feeling: and the outside observer may conclude that they are tempted to minimize the influence of factors they cannot measure and even sometimes to deny that they exist. It is incidentally fascinating to notice how, when they extend to human behaviour the methods and presuppositions of their earlier work, they seem to rationalize the belief that when man fell he fell away from the glorious liberty of the children of God into an animal automatism; an automatism which, since he is not wholly an animal, set him under the domination of the idea of mechanism and of the machines his brain created, from prayer-wheels to electronic brains and a concept of the State based on the image of a robot Leviathan.",

Though appearance is not a reference in a person. Sometimes appearance also shows the lifestyle and communication shown. Although the appearance will unwittingly become a reference for everyone to show their mood. From there appearance can be said as communication. Appearance is also the basis of one's personality that can be judged and seen by others. It turns out that the appearance is not only from clothes, but from the whole body starting from make up, body shape, and attractiveness. Nonverbal communication in this case arises from the characteristics of someone seen from his physical. Good appearance is given priority and is needed in business or employment. The reason is because appearance becomes the main thing in someone's opinion about the person that shows how to communicate each individual. A person's characteristics are certainly seen in non-verbal messages conveyed. One component that affects communication is returning to the appearance in communication. Good dress is very supportive of appearance and very harmonious appearance that will facilitate communication to each individual.

      "abstract": "Part 1. There exists a minority of individuals who report that they have never, in their lifetimes, formed an extremely close personal and emotional relationship with another human being. Psychological research indicates that, compared with persons who report that they have at some time entered into such a relationship, these .non-close-relaters. tend to be more shy, more lacking in trust, more introverted and more lacking in social skills. In addition, non-closerelaters are less likely to believe in ESP or to report personal experience of paranormal phenomena; that is, they are more often than not intellectual and experiential .goats.. This paper explores a number of possible explanations. normal and paranormal.for this attitudinal difference: it is suggested that while ordinary psychological processes do play a r le, the difference can best be understood if one additionally postulates the bidirectional operation of the paranormal: in particular, it is proposed that certain .extraverted. personality types will manifest hitting, in order to further the development of desired relationships; while certain .introverted. personality types will miss, with the effect of reducing intimacy in their dealings with other people. If it is assumed that instances of .negative ESP. in everyday life usually fail to be recognized as constituting ESP, then this would account for the non-close-relater.s failure to report paranormal experiences.

      "abstract": "Behavioral pediatrics begins, as a discipline, with at least two important assumptions: (1) that all human experiences have psychosocial as well as biological or organic contexts; and (2) that the biological substrate with which the child is born is modifiable. Thus, behavioral pediatrics, by its own definitions and assumptions, initiates research questions at the biobehavioral interface.1 This paper attempts to delineate a number of research directions that may be used to investigate the complex relationships between behavioral and biological factors in behavioral pediatrics. Research investigating biobehavioral processes can be approached on a number of different levels. The research can be organized in terms of the following specific causal assumptions relating behavioral and biological factors: (1) a parallel model; (2) a causal model in which behavioral factors influence biological factors; (3) a causal model in which biological factors determine behavior; and (4) a causal model in which there is bidirectional causality. 1. Parallels Between Behavior and Biology. This model assumes that there is no directional causality. Behavioral and biological factors represent parallel systems sharing a common underlying organization. Behavioral and physiological variables may be viewed as different levels of the same system, mediated by central nervous system processes. Various screening methods are based on this model. Research questions dealing with this model focus on indexing and predicting developmental outcome. Techniques such as the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale2 or the identification of sleep patterns3 evaluate behavioral patterns and attempt to identify neurophysiological or neurological dysfunction. Similarly, physiological response patterns such as infant cry patterns4 or heart rate variability measures such as cardiac vagal tone5 have been used to predict developmental outcome when the behavioral repertoire is too limited to be useful in predicting subsequent behavior.",

      "title": "A Plea for Pity",
      "abstract": "A Plea for Pity Robert H. Kimball Introduction Does the ability to feel pity toward the unfortunate represent one of humanity's better instincts, on par with the capacity for love, compassion, and forgiveness? Or is pity actually one of our morally baser emotions, like jealousy, envy, or hatred, because pity can include contempt for its object and an attitude of morally reprehensible superiority on the part of the pitier? Surprisingly, there is little philosophical consensus on this issue, with informed opinion nearly equally divided. That the same emotion can elicit such contrary evaluations shows how elusive a clear understanding of pity can be. Furthermore, is there something wrong—either logically or morally—with attempting to arouse the emotion of pity in others when they do not already feel it themselves (or do not feel it as intensely as we want them to)? Should appeals to pity be rejected because any emotion is inimical to clear thinking or simply irrelevant to the justification of action? Or is there something particularly morally reprehensible about trying to manipulate another's emotions and actions specifically on the basis of pity? Alternatively, at least in some cases could an exhortation to pity be an acceptable, even desirable, aspect of moral education or an often-necessary reminder to care about the misfortunes of others and not just to pursue our own self-interests? Surprisingly, opinion (at least in the informal fallacy tradition) is remarkably unanimous about the undesirability of appealing to pity. But I think their reasons can be improved upon. Traditional analyses of appeal to pity do not seriously analyze the emotion being appealed to, and most treatments of pity as an emotion do not address its use in rhetorical manipulation. I claim that what is wrong with appeal to pity can be satisfactorily understood only if pity itself is adequately understood. I propose to proceed by combining these two questions: what is wrong with pity? and what is wrong with appeal to pity? [End Page 301] In answering the second question, the textbook tradition of informal fallacy analysis holds that when a speaker attempts to arouse pity in an audience in order to induce an action, this situation should be interpreted not under the rubric of nonlogical causal influence, manipulation, or rhetorical persuasion but rather as belonging to the domain of (informal) logic, and in particular as a failed attempt at argument in which a descriptive premise that A pities B does not entail the normative conclusion that B deserves A's help (or that A should help B). Thus in the informal fallacy tradition, experiencing the emotion of pity is never a valid justification for action.2 I believe this rigid reason/emotion distinction has little basis in our actual belief-forming and decision-making practices. Nor do I believe that emotion should be excluded from reasoning, since our emotions are often informative and are sometimes more reliable guides to action than argument. In Appeal to Pity, Douglas Walton (1997) presents a nuanced and considerably more subtle alternative to the textbook tradition, in which he evaluates epistemically the effect of the emotional state of pity on practical reasoning. Analyzing such cases as charitable appeals (e.g., for starving people and disaster victims, arguments for hardship exemptions from general rules, and alleged atrocities), he emphasizes especially the particularizing nature of pity and the way it overrides universal principles, especially of justice. Under Walton's epistemic evaluation of pity, it emerges as a reason-clouding emotion under certain conditions. Furthermore, he shows how the occurrence of pity is susceptible to manipulation; he emphasizes especially cases in which pity is not actually deserved or justified but is manipulatively made to seem so. But Walton looks at a very small slice of the landscape of pity and what might be problematic about it. So in order to evaluate pity fully—not just epistemically but also as a moral emotion and its role in a fully flourishing life—we need to expand our concept of pity. In fact, pity is a very difficult and complex emotion to analyze (Solomon 1993). Definition of \"pity\" In pitying someone, such as a homeless person, a starving child, or a mutilated...",

Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior plays an important role in survival, reproduction, and building/maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

      "abstract": "paper discusses the authors’ threefold approach—clinical, theoretical, and experimental—to autistic constellation disorders called E-Motion mis-sight and other temporospatial processing disorders of sensory flows. According to this approach, persons with autism spectrum disorders present more or fewer difficulties in the perception and integration of physical and biological movements, and more generally in perceiving “online” sensory events and sensory flows coming from the environmental world, as well as in sensorial-motor coupling and production on time of motor and verbal and emotional communication events. These difficulties occur from the very beginning of their life. In other words, the environmental world is going and changing too fast for at least some autistic persons. Their perception of various sensory flows is therefore desynchronized. Instead of being unified, coherent, continuous, and synchronized, integration and inscription of motion, time, and duration in their mind and body appear to be spatially fragmented and temporally desynchronized. Living in a different space-time, autistic children cannot connect with or tune into physical and human world adequately; they cannot connect their inner world with the external world properly. Some autistic children succeed in correcting or compensating more or less their fragmented, discontinuous, and desynchronized perception of their environment by slowing it down, stopping it, repeating it, and/or by over-self-involving perceptually in details of sensory events, and even by sticking adhesively to objects. This paper demonstrates how the authors’ approach is able to open promising new perspectives for the reeducation of verbal and emotional communication disorders of autistic persons via an original software aimed at slowing down the facial movements and the speech of their caretakers. On the neurofunctional level, these temporospatial processing disorders may be very plausibly accounted by a multi-system neural dyssynchronization and dysconnectivity, involving numerous interconnected neurofunctional systems. In conclusion, autistic disorders, as a particular case of the conscious state, shed light on the functioning and dysfunctioning of the human brain and psyche.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Xenophobia is a concept that has not received a great deal of attention in the psychological literature. According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word consists of two parts: xeno (referring to “guest, stranger, person that looks different, foreigner”) and phobia (“fear, horror or aversion”). Although there has been little research or writing focusing directly on xenophobia, as a concept it raises three important issues that are relevant for research on prejudice and which have received a good deal of attention in the literature. First, prejudice does not necessarily involve negative attitudes towards others (e.g., they are dirty or untrustworthy). Simply perceiving a person as foreign, alien, or strange is sufficient to produce aversion or a preference for reduced contact. Second, xenophobia highlights the fact that prejudice against others involves both cognitive and emotional elements: It involves not only viewing other groups as different along some socially important dimension, but also having an aversive emotional reaction towards that difference. Third, prejudice is often studied within the context of intergroup relations or as attitudes held towards specific social groups; however, prejudice can also involve an aversion to difference per se . Xenophobia highlights the fact that sometimes people show dislike for others simply when they appear different to one's own “kind.” This form of prejudice is anchored in a love of or preference for people who are similar to one's self and an aversion to anyone who differs from one's self. In what follows I will review research and theory that elucidates each of these three central components of xenophobia, therefore providing some grounding for a term that has itself received little empirical investigation.",

Each point is associated with a relating objective called a state of relatedness. This is attained or maintained either by relating or being related to. People acquire relating competencies and establish sources and stores of each state. Emotional responses are linked with the successful attainment, danger of losing, or actual loss of states.

      "abstract": "There are some dimensionalities of altruistic behavior: Purity, whether the motivation is pure altruism or self-regard; Degree, whether the help is of his all or not; Extent, whether he supplies help for all men or not; Frequency, whether he does often or not. From the point of purity, there are two types of altruistic behavior, one is soft altruism, whose genuine motivation is wishing to get the benefaction for the future from the one who had received help from himself ago, and it results in building a mutual-benefit system of cognation or non-cognation between men. The other is hard altruism, that’s to say, people gain satisfaction not from the someone’s benefaction who was once received help from himself but from the altruistic behavior itself. From the point of degree, hard altruistic behavior can also be separated into two types: limited (moderate) hard altruistic behavior and infinite (thorough) hard altruistic behavior. The former obey the rule of descending marginal utility, therefore, from the point of evolvement, it can’t decrease does’ existent adaptability. The latter does not obey the rule of descending marginal utility but increasing one, then the condition of maximum utility lies on putting all his scarce resource to altruistic behavior. So it will descend individual adaptability, even victimize individual survival, and it results the Darwin-Jam. How can it come into being, come through and evolve by the process of natural selection? Altruistic behavior is often considered to have relationship with sympathy and moral culture. Father, someone’s sympathy and moral culture often point to special kind of human not to all. So from the broad sense sympathy and moral action have relation with self-identity. From the point of extent, the man who gives the benefaction generally thinks that the man who receives his benefaction is of the same category. Why do men have the self-identity based on the sympathy and moral culture? From the point of individual, may be it has relation with gene. As infest animal, if he doesn`t have any self-identity and will not do any victimization for anyone, it has much difficulty to inherit his gene probably in the process of evolvement, because no one will become his consort. In the other extreme, if he has self-identity too extensive and too strong and helps everyone of his all, the rate of survival must be very low and it also has difficulty to inherit his gene probably. Most of the people have certain scope of self-identity, and the extent of altruistic behavior depends on the scope and object of self-identity, which often has the most strong core and then descends as scope broadening step by step. The degree of altruistic behavior lies on the degree that the one received benefaction is identified by the one gives the benefaction, and they have positive relation. The descending sequence of different people’s self-identity from strong to weak is often different, many people put relative and friends in a more important position, then neighbor, estate, class, nation, country, race and so on.Considered from the point of extent, the most frequently altruistic behavior is to relative first, then to special beneficial non-relative, and last to universal men.Considered from the point of degree, the most frequent relative altruistic behavior is infinite hard altruistic behavior, then to special beneficially non-relative, and last to universal men. The scope and object of self-identity, the descending sequence of self-identity and the degree that he will do for the object he approbated have relation with the culture and tradition of his living environment, that`s to say, it has relation with family education that he received from childhood, school education, social living record of himself. From the point of society, what needs answer is why it can form such culture and tradition, family education and school education, which enable some one to come into being self-identity, sympathy and moral culture. And in the living culture of every nation, there is praise for non-relative altruistic behavior, which will cause the altruistic behavior of someone with self-identity, and the different scope and degree has relation with his different living record. The culture and tradition of such praise for non-relative altruistic behavior can explain individual hard altruistic behavior, especially infinite hard altruistic behavior; while competition and conflict between different nations can explain the form of such culture and tradition. So we need explain one’s non-relative hard altruistic behavior, especially infinite hard altruistic behavior from two lays: gene and culture. Gene lay determines that most of the people have certain self-identity and form the physiological basis of altruistic behavior, while the scope and object, descending sequence of self-identity and the degree of willing victimize for the people of the same category is determined by culture and tradition. The competition between individual and colony makes someone who mixes self-regard and altruism pro rate and his colony have more adaptability in multiple competition.",

      "abstract": "Splitting the personality from the context, even if in an informal, nonstructured situation, is impossible, while the behaviour stability vs. the behaviour instability are even more obvious in the case of symbolic interactions, among which the language is the most important one. It records only the most frequent phenomena, being incapable of naming what is unique or particular. The conscious or unconscious distortion of a message places the recipient in an emotional state of uncertainty that may go from sadness to deep anxiety. The deliberate elusion of the psychopathological terminology - having the explicit role of distracting the patient’s attention from his/her personal troubles, breaking thus the contemplation of one’s own suffering - is not an universally accepted technique; the strategic therapy, for example, focuses exclusively on the symptomatic behaviour that needs to be changed, keeping, however, the linguistic expression of the suffering in the terms suggested by the patients: not only is the exacerbated verbalization of his/her suffering accepted by the therapist, but it is also reformulated, encouraged, and prescribed, the method being attributed to Avicenna, the famous doctor of the Antiquity. From a therapeutic perspective, ignoring the linguistic expression of a symptom the consequences of which are unpredictable, is thought to be inefficient: once accepted, it has to be integrated in a new interpersonal system, the change of the context engendering the change of the message unconsciously spread by the patient: isolation, as primordial pathogenous source and, implicitly, the refuse of the intersubjective communication, have a high self-destructuring potential.",

      "abstract": "Psychology, robotic and virtual agents communities commonly claim that to enable natural interaction to take place withi n dyad of agents, the dyad must be the siege of dynamical coupling: to give to their partners a feeling of natural interaction, int eractants be human, robotic or virtual, must be able to make the dynamic of their behaviour emerge both from their own internal states and from their partner’s behaviours. However, most virtual age nts engines for interactions model communication as a step by step phenomenon, where pre-scripted signals and corresponding feedbacks alternate. We propose here an agent architecture which generates non-verbal behaviours in live, influenced by both the intern al state of the agent and the continuously incoming reaction of its partner. This architecture enables an agent facing either another agent or a human, to emphasise shared behaviours (called Snowball effect), to decrease un-shared behaviours as well as to align dynamically with its partner’s behaviour.",

      "title": "Semiotic Threshold: Animals and People",
      "abstract": "Abstract The author discusses the question of whether animals have a language. The article examines the similarities and differences in the linguistic capabilities of animals and humans. The similarity lies in the fact that animals can use symbolic signs to receive and send messages. Among other things, they can receive and interpret signs on a delayed basis without the direct presence of their sender, although to a fundamentally lesser extent than people. The comparison is carried out both for signs perceived by the organism (afferent signs) and for signs created by the organism (efferent signs), both related to communication and the perception of the environment outside the community. The main difference is the possibility of telling about events outside the “here and now” in which the narrator could or may not take part. This is the narrative. No signs of animals using the narrative were found. The resulting differences in storytelling use are hypothesized to be related to additional language functions that have increased in humans compared to animals. People have psychological characteristics caused by the presence of the stage of individuation and separation in development. This allows them to move away from the situation and see it from the outside, which is necessary for retelling. On the other hand, people need to communicate with the help of a narrative, since their society includes a sacred part, whose members receive descriptions of events, requests, questions, and their answers in the form of various signs and the results fortune-telling need a detailed interpretation.",

      "abstract": "One of the major concerns of this book is with those properties of people which are intertwined with their sociality, yet are irreducible to it. These properties make for personal identity and their emergence is the subject of this chapter and the next. Introspectively, we are all constantly aware of the main property upon which this emergent process depends. As human beings we know that we live a rich inner life: that we are in continuous communion with ourselves and that we engage in a continual running commentary with the events going on around us. We are aware of how our inner lives monitor our responses to external situations in which we find ourselves and indeed modify some of the circumstances to which we willingly expose ourselves, be these natural, practical or social. For example, it is doubtful if there is a (normal) human being who is unaware of an internal dialogue which silently voices sentiments like, ‘Isn't he ever going to stop talking?’, ‘Careful, that truck's pulling out’, or, ‘I can't face that again.’ Moreover, we all also know that these are not just idle commentaries.",

      "title": "Initial Reactions to Unfamiliarity",
      "abstract": "All animals regularly encounter events that recruit attention and a vigilant posture because the stimuli share some features with similar events encountered in the past. Some animals typically approach these discrepant events, whereas others typically avoid them. This fact became a fundamental principle for Schneirla,1 who spent much of his career trying to understand ap proach-avoidant behavior in ani mals. There are at least three differ ent questions one can ask about these complementary reactions to unfamiliar events. One line of inquiry seeks to de termine, within or between species, which events consistently elicit ap proach and which avoidance. The sight of the mother usually provokes the former in mammalian infants; the sight of an unfamiliar adult typi cally provokes an initial avoidance. A second question asks about inter specific differences in approach or avoidance to the same class of events. One-year-old macaque monkeys avoid, at least initially, an unfamiliar monkey of the same age, whereas 3-year-old children (roughly comparable to 1-year-old monkeys because the macaque grows at a rate three times that of the human) more often approach an un familiar peer. Finally, one can ask about intraspecific differences in the tendency to approach or to avoid",

Mortality poses the optimal task of Realization (in many positive coping and existential senses) versus Denial (or other nonrecognition or emotional paralysis) or Fear (or apprehension or even terror). Premorbid awareness of illness may contribute to or challenge Realization.

Philosophers who have studied games to determine their nature have evidently established two hypotheses: on the one hand, that all games can be studied collectively, as though the essence of the game were common to all, and on the other hand, that the answer to the problem lies in the subject, or who plays, and not in the game itself considered as an object. The question then is to determine the psychological, biological or social reasons that induce men or animals to play, the inclinations that are involved, but not the external structures to which games must conform in order to please or to be adopted.",

Gestures are symbols that mean the same thing to the sending and receiving parties in interaction. In symbolic interactionism, then, individuals are conceptualized as reading the gestures of others – words, facial expressions, bodily countenance, or any behavior that carries common meaning – in a process of mutual role-taking in which people mentally place themselves in the place or role of the other. From mutual role-taking, individuals adjust their respective lines of conduct in ways that facilitate the smooth flow of interaction or, if desired, disrupt and breach the interaction. During role-taking, individuals not only see others as objects in a situation, they also see themselves as objects. For interactionists, it is this behavioral capacity for self (or the ability to see oneself as an object in a situation) that is the central dynamic of all social interaction.",

      "abstract": "Ernest Becker highlights the experience-limiting function of culture. Without such restriction, life, in all of its mystery and terror, is just too much for the self-conscious animal to bear. Culture has developed as a result of a need to minimize the force of life and anxiety associated with the inevitability of death. Successfully socialized individuals can envelop themselves in a death-denying and life-directing and limiting symbolic order. The set of symptoms we think of as schizophrenia are, on the one hand, associated with an inability to link up with the experience-managing, death-anxiety buffering, cultural order, and on the other, with the tendency to remain split off from the body. Individuals with the diagnosis of schizophrenia often do not rely on repression to manage their experience, but instead on the insufficient defense of dissociation. The paradoxical result of the dissociative defense is an overwhelming and terrifying experience. Successful psychotherapy involves helping the fearful, traumatized and interpersonally distant patient tolerate and even welcome body and affect. The attachment with the psychotherapist unblocks affect through an undoing of dissociative processes and a linking of the patient with the consensual, repression-based, symbolic order.",

In this sense, an interaction with a robot is asymmetric. When interacting with a robot one is unsure what behavior to expect as the appearance does not necessarily make the abilities of the robot transparent. In human-human interaction, we can also find asymmetric interactions to occur. For example, in an interaction with a child, adults have to adapt to the learner's capabilities and understanding. Similarly, in interactions with special populations such as persons with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), asymmetry occurs as specific information seems to be processed differently.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to the scientist Paul Ekman we are now able to assess the type of influence that our non-verbal behaviour has on other people: we can now judge the ability of people to send non-verbal signals and know how to interpret them. We recognize that information provided by words in some cases is contradicted and refuted by the non-verbal expressions that accompany it, and that, when one cannot use words, information can be communicated through non-verbal signs. The emotions are states of mind associated with physiological and psychophysiological changes, with internal or external stimuli, or with natural or learned behaviour. They are associated with mood, temperament, personality and disposition, and motivation. In most cases, lies can be detected because of signs of hidden emotions; the more intense and varied the emotions are, the more likely it is that a lie is unintentionally betrayed. The facial expressions and body language can reveal deep emotions: the presence of a specific emotional state is indicated by a shaky voice, an alteration of tone, a sunny smile, or a furrowed brow. Unlike ordinary expressions and gestures, it is difficult to hide micro-expressions and micro-gestures. Micro-expressions express the seven universal emotions: disgust, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, and contempt. In 1990 Paul Ekman expanded this list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions, not all encoded in facial muscles. These emotions are amusement, contempt, embarrassment, excitement, guilt, pride, relief, satisfaction, pleasure, and shame. Micro-gestures are hard to conceal too, because every little movement is like a word that has a different meaning according to the use made of it in a ‘sentence’. Therefore, in order to analyze a gesture correctly one should keep in mind the context in which it is expressed.",

      "title": "Proxemics [and Comments and Replies]",
      "abstract": "Virtually everything that man is and does is associated with space. Man's sense of space is a synthesis of many sensory inputs: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and thermal. Not only does each of these constitute a complex system (as for example, the dozen or more different ways of experiencing depth visually), but each is molded and patterned by culture. Hence people reared in different cultures live in different sensory worlds. What is more, they are generally unaware of the degree to which the worlds may differ. From the study of culture we learn that the patterning of perceptual worlds is a function not only of the specific culture but of the relationship, activity, and emotions present in a given situation. Therefore, when two people of different cultures interact, each uses different criteria to interpret the other's behavior, and each may easily misinterpret the relationship, the activity, or the emotions involved. The study of culture in the proxemic sense is the study of peoples' use of their perceptual apparatus in different emotional states during different activities, in different relationships, settings, and contexts. No single research technique is sufficient in scope to investigate this complex, multi-dimensional subject. The research technique is, therefore, a function of the particular facet under examination at the time and many call for the involvement of many disciplines. Like all basic studies of the communicative process, proxemics, as I think of it, is more concerned with how than why, and more concerned with structure than content. The work is admittedly detailed and is apt to be routine. It addresses itself to basic human situations in an area of culture that is ordinarily hidden from conscious awareness. For this reason, proxemics frequently leads to new insights about specific cultures, as well as to insights into the generalized concept of culture itself. In formulating my thinking concerning proxemics, I have maintained that culture is an extension of basic biological processes. While man's extensions as they evolve may mask the underlying relationships which maintain the equilibrium of biological systems, the relationships and systems are no less real by virtue of being hidden. In the words of Ian McHarg (1963): ...no species can exist without an environment, no species can exist in an environment of its exclusive creation, no species can survive, save as a nondisruptive member of an ecological community. Every member must adjust to other members of the community and to the environment in order to survive. Man is not excluded from this test.",

      "abstract": "A. Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive , it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional , it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas. B. The following remarks are confined to the absence of criminal capacity on the volitional level, to which we shall refer in short as “volitional insanity’. This is the case where the person at the time of his act did not have a choice between acting or not acting due to a disease affecting his mind. This case is also referred to as the commission of an act as a result of an irresistible morbid impulse.",

The unthinkable mainly refers to unacceptable or highly unlikely occurences. The unspeakable is considered too repulsive or outrageous to voice. It both overlaps with and differs from the unsayable inasmuch as the latter can signify something that cannot be said because there is no possibility of either saying or naming it. The ineffable often relates to sacred or divine qualities, or approached through Derrida’s notion of différance. The inarticulable can follow from a deficiency of linguistic expression or be identified in psychoanalysis as repression, blockage, or trauma. The first four modalities concern the ways in which silence intervenes in and manages human expressiveness. The sixth and seventh relate to silences at the very limits of epistemological or ontological reach. The unknowable pertains to a fundamental lack of information, while the unconceptualizable refers to the unavailability of an intellectual and cultural apparatus through which certain kinds of knowledge can be processed. The fifth—the unnoticeable—is an outlier both to the first four and to the last two. It shares with the former the presence of epistemological constraints on conveying knowledge. It shares with the latter the presence of circumstances that sever the accessibility of human agency to evidence or knowledge. They are reflected in Bourdieu’s phrase ‘it goes without saying because it comes without saying’.",

There are some people who are differently abled and unfortunately they do not have the ability to use their senses to the best extent.

As this hinders the communication between the challenged person say bed-ridden or even paralysed and the common people, it affects to a great extent in their progress and makes them difficult to achieve their dreams. To bridge this gap in communication there is a need of system of gesture recognition or sign language.",

      "abstract": "Maria Frick, Combining physical actions and verbal announcements as \"What I'm doing\" combinations in everyday conversation Frick's paper examines a particular type of announcement in spoken interaction, one in which a speaker verbalizes what they are about to do next.These announcements are accompanied/followed by the speaker's executing the announced action.Therefore, they are said to form an 'action combination': clausal verbal announcement + physical action, constituting a \"What I'm doing\" combination.This type of action combination is an initial (i.e., non-responsive) but not an initiating action, as it does not make a response conditionally relevant.It is distinct from an informing (and is thus not epistemically driven), and also distinct from a directive (thus is not deontically driven).It is appropriate when participants are about to do something that departs from a social norm: break out of a group unilaterally, leave the room, take more than one's share of food, use a boarding-house reach to help oneself at the dinner table, etc.The paper thus makes an original contribution to the understanding of (one kind of) announcement and its use in everyday Finnish conversation, while at the same time pointing to a hitherto unexplored action combination.It demonstrates that declarative clauses are combined with simultaneous or following physical actions within the social action of treating the physical action as accountable and as a departure from social norms.6.

      "abstract": "This paper is not about the silence of the other. Neither is it a phenomenological, hermeneutical, political, aesthetical or ethnographical account of silence taken as a form of existential practice. It concerns an ethics. It explores, rather than an ethics of semiotic care or recognition, an ethical structure, possibility or resources of silence, the still auditory, disclosed in the disrelational ontology of language: a richness and complexity of that dramatic tension, the postlapsarian interplay between fallen time and fallen language; the key question is how not to sanitise, fetishise and economise on the dialogic inadequacy of the other, of the dumb foreigner in us. Silence, thus approached as a universal speech act, as the inclusive preclusion of the word across time, space and cultures, is more specific, precise and resonant than quietude or muteness, the absence or eradication of sounds. Silence, thus understood, is then not a mystified non-language, a solipsistic disproof or disqualification of mediated communication but the language that is forever foreign. The originary force of silence, its speechless power is an evolutionary index to ethical dialogue, or rather dialogue as an ethical act. We, of we-are-the-world, should be able to communicate not in spite of, but through, silence.",

We, the professionals, set up artificial scenes, moving one or another of their parts, in order to put the child-in appropriate conditions or to induce one behaviour rather than another. It is through interactions between grown-up and baby that natural processes of language appropriation and though development fall into place. The different areas of child development are not partitioned, and interactions can be observed between motor, cognitive and linguistic development. The child's motor or psychomotor behaviour may sometimes be the expression of well-being, of feeling unwell, of a request, of a desire. Even with the average child, it is not always easy to decode these signals. With the deaf child, adults are sometimes so concerned with linguistics and audition that motor expressions tend to be assigned a lesser role. However, by observing the child as a whole, our actions can become more adequate and better targeted.",

      "title": "Why Avoid a Monkey: The Refusal of Interaction in Galen’s Epideixis",
      "abstract": "Every object surrounding our environment can give us an opportunity to use it or to change its place and function in our cognitive horizon. But in the specific case concerning nonhuman animals, it is not just a one-directional dimension (from man to others) which is involved, but a two-directional one. Animals can react to our actions or they can simply make the first move offering us a mutual affordance. Interactions between animals and humans are crucial in the cultural analysis of ancient society: animals were everywhere, and their particular bond with humans could be conceptualised in culturally specific ways (cognitive metaphors) or contribute to elaborate the image of a social group (see, for example, the case of interactions with horses among the elites in classical Greece). However, the interactional dimension between animals and humans can give rise to other cultural phenomena: for instance, cases of missed interactions caused by the refusal of interacting practices. This paper focuses on the name and cultural avoidance of monkeys in the Graeco-Roman world, starting from a peculiar passage in Galen’s Anatomicae administrationes (VIII 8) where the author rejects the vivisection of primates, defining them as a “hideous spectacle” (εἰδεχθὲς θέαμα). Why should a monkey be avoided, especially on such an important public occasion as a medical show (ἐπίδειξις)? In Galen’s corpus a possible answer could be found in the light of some passages offering an alternative name for ‘monkey’: καλλίας (‘the handsome one’), which was a euphemistic and auspicious term counteracting the otherwise presumed inauspicious nature of primates, at least according to ancient Greek folklore.",

      "title": "Grief: A Disrupted Human Relationship",
      "abstract": "The interdependence of two partners in a system of human relations can be exemplified by the analysis of alterations in the behavior and subjective state of the survivor in a relationship which has been broken. Individuals in states of acute bereavement are of special interest because they are reacting to the cessation of a human relationship which cannot be duplicated. The method such persons use to deal with the loss of the dead partner has drawn the attention of Freud, and has been described in some detail by Lindemann. He has designated as benign those reactions to a bereavement which are self-limited and lead to a new structure of human relationships in which the interaction with the person lost is replaced by satisfying interaction with new individuals. A prerequisite for such a replacement seems to be the ability of the bereaved to release his emotional tie to the deceased despite the attending discomfort of sorrow and subsequently to replace the type of interaction lost. The grieving person may not be able to accomplish this job because of his inability to tolerate the attending emotional distress or because of his excessive need to maintain interaction with the deceased. Then he will develop a morbid reaction, in which the distress of grief is hidden by a protracted state of emotional preoccupation and impairment of mental functioning, forming a neurosis which requires psychiatric help. The following case history, elicited recently in a woman patient in the clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital, provides an unusually clear demonstration of the interactional problems to be found in a grieving person.",

      "title": "Symbolic Environment and Liking",
      "abstract": "George C. Homans (1950) has set forth an assumption about the relation between interaction and liking: the frequency of interaction between two or more persons increases, the degree of their liking for one another will increase, and vice versa. (p. 112). After some criticism concerning the generality of the assumption, he has added that the thesis is valid only when the interaction is not forced (1961, p. 186-187). This reasonably means that if one of the actors in the interaction sequence dislikes one of the others, the thesis is not assumed to be generally valid. Homans has shown in a somewhat convincing manner that this thesis is reasonable and can be supported by different kinds of empirical data. From this it follows that: (1) If A likes B (and B does not dislike A), then A and B will interact. By interaction or communication we mean every action performed in a social situation. The concept interaction is a central one in what Homans means by group, namely: . . a number of persons who communicate with one another often over a span a time, and who are few enough so that each person is able to communicate with all the others, not at secondhand, through other people, but face-to-face (1950, p. 1). From this definition and (1) it follows that: (2) If A and B interact then A and B belong to the same group. This is true only provided that A and B do not meet by chance at some isolated times and are temporary acquaintances. Now let us introduce Torgny T. Segerstedt's concept of symbolic environment, which can be defined in the following way: the symbolic environment is the meaning the words (the verbal symbols) have for a person. By meaning we imply here the object to which the word is knitted, the behaviour which is associated with the word, and the emotion which is associated with the word.",

This shared reality includes the message that the world either has accomplishments to be promoted, inducing a promotion focus, or has dangers and mistakes to be prevented, inducing a prevention focus. Evidence is presented that these different types of regulatory focus influence both people's memory for different life events and their emotional responses to them. Evidence is also presented that: (a) self-regulatory confusion occurs when shared reality with different significant others about desired selves is in conflict; (b) alienation is produced when there is a lack of shared reality with others about one's actual self; and (c) people prefer information about their actual selves that is shared with significant others as compared to equally self-relevant but unshared information. In these ways, shared reality shapes the world that we experience.",

Social problems are general factors that affect and damage society. A social problem is normally a term used to describe problems within a particular area or a group of people in the world. Social problem often involve problems that affect real life. It also affects how people react to certain situations [1] .

      "abstract": "Abstract The overall premise of this concluding chapter is that human relations can never be stable. Whether they are biologically or socially structured (usually these categories overlap), relations require nurturing, care, and attention. They also require uncertainty, the potential to fail, as well as loneliness and longing. Discussing utterances and tactical use of kinship terminology, personal names, and nicknames, this chapter discusses how relations in Illorsuit (pseudonym) continually re-invoked and negotiated. Some relatives may cease to address each other using appropriate kinship terminology; sometimes out of spite, other times out of respect. Others may long for the return of a dead ancestor so much that they end up willing their return, while others are content with the sporadic moments in which their dead relatives make themselves known in young children. Either way, an ideal model of kinship in Illorsuit (pseudonym), must be able to accommodate for the un-ideal and the instability and uncertainty inherent in human relationships. The chapter finally draws on the Figure-Ground reversal as one such model, arguing that ideal kinship in Greenland is simultaneously figure and ground, that is, relatedness and loneliness at the same time.",

      "title": "Asymmetry in the estimation of interpersonal distance and identity affirmation",
      "abstract": "Abstract An asymmetry effect is known to exist in the estimation of interpersonal distance, depending on whether the point of reference for the estimation is the subject (‘How far are the others from you?’) or the others How far are you from the others?). It looks as though, through the effect of a self‐centring schema, subjects feel that others occupy their own space more than they occupy the space of others. A self‐centring schema has also been found in many other processes involving judgment or comparison of oneself and others. It is generally interpreted as a sign of the affirmation and defence of personal identity. The three experiments reported here attempt to relate the asymmetries in the distances perceived between persons represented on a map to the following three areas in which one's sense of personal or group identity is involved: (1) in the perception of one's own specificity with respect to others (or of the specificity of the group to which one belongs with respect to other groups) (experiment 1), (2) in one's ability to put oneself in the place of others (exocentrism) (experiment 2). and (3) in the individuation of oneself by others (experiment 3). The results of these three experiments lead us to believe that it is indeed the processes of identification and affirmation of personal and group identity ‐ along with the underlying categorization processes — that are the source of the asymmetries observed in interpersonal distance estimation. The consistency of the data obtained in different situations also validates the technique used for estimating interpersonal distance.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest",
      "abstract": "The article considers the peculiarities of the behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest. It is indicated that the following features should be taken into account when studying the typology of victims of violent incest: 1) biological and psychological features and types of victims; 2) circumstances that preceded / contributed to the commission of the violent act; 3) the behavior of the victim at the time of the act of violence and after it. Establishing these features will provide an opportunity to more fully and correctly classify juvenile victims of violent incest. The author points out that in the general sense, the types of juvenile victims of sexual crimes do not differ sharply from the general public. At the same time, the typology of such persons is somewhat narrowed due to the frequent dominance of certain features that provoke the criminal offender to commit an illegal act. For example, if a person seeks to commit theft or robbery / robbery, the victim often plays a secondary role, as circumstances that contribute to the offense come to the fore (dark time of day, absence of outsiders, etc.). In the case of violent incest or any other socially dangerous act of a sexual nature, the language focuses on the victim as the \"object of desire.\" That is why the criminal offender usually pays attention to two aspects: the biological characteristics of the victim and the psychological characteristics (behavioral reactions). A study of statistics and jurisprudence concluded that in most cases this type of criminal offense is committed against juveniles who have an attractive appearance and passive behavior (do not make excessive efforts to protect and prevent incest). Attention is drawn to the fact that the provocation of violent incest is inherent in older minors and is due to the desire to prove to their loved ones their adulthood, sexuality and readiness for sexual intercourse. Often such victims seek to feel wanted, but do not understand the real threat of experiencing illegal sexual influence, especially from a close relative.",

Some cues to this are fairly obvious (as when someone stares intensely at you), but others seem more subtle. For example, increased cognitive load or emotional arousal causes one's pupils to dilate. This phenomenon is frequently employed as a physiological measure of arousal, in studies of pupillometry. Here, in contrast, we employ it as a stimulus for social perception. Might the human visual system be naturally and automatically engaging in \"unconscious pupillometry\"? We demonstrate that faces rendered invisible (through continuous flash suppression) enter awareness faster when their pupils are dilated. This cannot be explained by appeal to differential contrast, differential attractiveness, or spatial attentional biases, and the effect vanishes when the identical stimuli are presented in socially meaningless ways (e.g., as shirt buttons or facial moles). These results demonstrate that pupil dilation is prioritized in visual processing even outside the focus of conscious awareness, in a form of unconscious \"attentional contagion.\" (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "title": "Prosociality, social cognition and empathy in psittacids and corvids",
      "abstract": "In the animal kingdom some species form complex social groups in which elaborated relationships between individuals occur. Prosocial behaviors, i.e. actions that benefit others, preferentially occur between closely affiliated individuals and may be driven by empathy, the ability to identify and share the emotional states of others. Birds, particularly corvids and parrots, are excellent candidates for investigating the link between social relationship and other-regarding behavior. They are long-lived and form long-term monogamous pair-bonds in which a high level of cooperation is seen throughout the year. The aim of this thesis is to study how the nature of a relationship (sibling, mate or friend) can modulate prosocial behavior and its underlying emotions in parrots and a corvid species. The approach was to study food-sharing or behavioral reactions to stressful situations such as distress call playback or exposure to novel objects, in different social contexts. Cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) reacted more to the distress calls of a closely affiliated partner than to those of a non-partner, and they preferably shared food with affiliated, related individuals. Different species of parrots preferentially chose a prosocial option over a selfish one, but it remains unclear whether they took the other’s perspective into account. Confronted with intimidating novel objects, jackdaws (Coloeus monedula) spent more time in mutual proximity when paired with their mate than when with a familiar opposite-sex non-partner. However, they were not bolder when accompanied by their mate compared to a non-partner. These results suggest that an emotional link exists between affiliated individuals and that this special bond drives their prosocial and empathic behavioral responses.",

      "title": "Lost in the socially extended mind: Genuine intersubjectivity and disturbed self-other demarcation in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Much of the characteristic symptomatology of schizophrenia can be understood as resulting from a pervasive sense of disembodiment. The body is experienced as an external machine that needs to be controlled with explicit intentional commands, which in turn leads to severe difficulties in interacting with the world in a fluid and intuitive manner. In consequence, there is a characteristic dissociality: Others become problems to be solved by intellectual effort and no longer present opportunities for spontaneous interpersonal alignment. This dissociality goes hand in hand with a progressive loss of the socially extended mind, which normally affords opportunities for co-regulation of cognitive and affective processes. However, at times people with schizophrenia report that they are confronted by the opposite of this dissociality, namely an unusual fluidity of the self-other boundary as expressed in experiences of ambiguous body boundaries, intrusions, and even merging with others. Here the person has not lost access to the socially extended mind but has instead become lost in it, possibly due to a weakened sense of self. We argue that this neglected aspect of schizophrenic social dysfunction can be usefully approached via the concept of genuine intersubjectivity: We normally participate in a shared experience with another person by implicitly co-regulating how our interaction unfolds. This co-regulation integrates our respective experience’s dynamical bases into one interpersonal process and gives the interaction an ambiguous second-person character. The upshot is that reports of abnormal self-other fluidity are not indicative of hallucinations without any basis in reality, but of a heightened sensitivity and vulnerability to processes of interpersonal alignment and mutual incorporation that form the normal basis of social life. We conclude by discussing implications of this view for both the science of consciousness as well as approaches to intervention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "I argue that the construction of the social order, as shown by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, depends on people’s ability to tame their inborn egoism. According to the philosopher’s anthropological assumptions a human being learns through life experiences how to control his selfinterest so that it does not threaten societal existence. During socialization, a human being – still an egoist to some extent – continues role-playing by the use of the psychological mechanisms of empathy and imagination. As a result he develops sympathy, at first, as a reaction to real people’s emotions experienced in a particular context. Finally, he naturally and more and more unconsciously takes under consideration the perspective of an impartial spectator. The gradually developing process brings about consequences that improve social morality, such as control over the expression of intense emotions, which is a condition for experiencing emotional harmony, or a refrain from pursuing one’s self-interest at the expense of someone else, so as not to become a subject of social contempt. One should also bear in mind that none of these consequences was carefully planned in advance nor purposefully executed.",

      "title": "Using metaphor in healthcare: Physical health",
      "abstract": "As shown throughout this volume, metaphors are regularly used to talk and think about experiences that are subjective, complex and sensitive in terms of experiences that are less subjective, simpler and more concrete. Health and illness, and the emotions associated with them, are among the experiences that we often talk about through metaphors. As is the case more generally, these metaphors tend to rely on perceived similarities between different kinds of experiences. For example, the metaphorical use of ‘battle’ in ‘she died after a long battle with cancer’ relies on the perception of a similarity between being ill with cancer and fighting in a war: both experiences are difficult and potentially life-threatening, both require perseverance, and so on. However, as our use of the term ‘perceived’ similarity suggests, metaphors do not reflect objectively given similarities, but can create similarities between unlike things: they can reflect, convey and reinforce different ways of seeing and experiencing different aspects of our lives. In the terms used in Conceptual Metaphor Theory (see Chapter 1), the choice of different source domains ‘frames’ the target domain in different ways, highlighting some aspects and backgrounding others (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Ritchie 2013).",

      "title": "Dolphin Social Cognition and Joint Attention: Our Current Understanding",
      "abstract": "Recent intense interest in social cognition in dolphins reflects findings that wild dolphins live in complex societies that rely on individual recognition, a protracted period of development, coalition formation, and cooperative, as well as competitive, social behaviors. Laboratory studies have revealed a host of cognitive skills that can support such complex behaviors—for example, broad imitative abilities, abilities to understand another’s indicative cues, and spontaneous use of pointing to communicate with human companions. Joint attention is recognized as a key element of social cognition that extends from simply following another’s gaze to using pointing or gazing cues of another to select objects or locations. Studies of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have revealed that they understand (1) human-given direct and cross-body points; (2) human-given dynamic and static pointing and gazing cues within object-choice tasks; (3) the geometry of pointing cues; (4) the referential character of pointing and gazing cues; (5) sequences of direct and/or crossbody points that were instructions to transport one object to another; (6) how to produce pointing cues and the importance of audience attention; and (7) possibly the belief state of another that is engaged in a joint attention task. The evidence suggests that joint attention skills in dolphins are robust and to some degree symmetric across comprehension and production. Comparative analyses indicate that in some areas of joint attention, abilities of dolphins exceed the demonstrated skills of apes. Possibly, a dolphin’s capacity for joint attention may be related to the adaptive benefits of being able to attend to the focus of another dolphin’s echolocation beam in conjunction with a sophisticated social structure dependent on attention to others.

      "abstract": "One of the major problems in sign system is the way of denotation. Any character included in the system, has certain characteristics taking into account the opportunities of its combination with other characters (inscriptions, utterances) of the system. Signs are always directly related to subjects they denote. However, we should always remember that symbols are associates with both verbal and non-verbal ways of denotation. The latter include, for example, the pictorial image, motion or gesture. The level of abstractness in sign systems complicates denotation process itself. How, for example, should one show the cold character of a subject or express joy in non-verbal system of denotation? Is the expression of certain emotions equivalent to emotions themselves and is it always possible to change their expression into their illustration? Syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects are compulsory for constructing the scheme of any sign system. The main problem is rooted not in the plane of construction, but in the plane of functioning of the given system in which exemplification as a way of symbolizing, proposed by Nelson Goodman in notation theory, plays a key role.",

If early humans had not discovered that their draw ings conveyed meaning to others as well as to themselves, the earliest form of pictorial communication, picture-writing, would never have begun. Therefore, a deeper study of the writing processes may lead to better understanding of reading problems. The interaction between language and drawing is not surprising if one considers that both are part of the symbolic function of the brain which makes possible the representation of an object, event, or conceptual scheme by means of a signifier or sign. Several behavior patterns fall under this representative or figura ti ve ability of the mind, and all are based on the evocation of an object or event which is not present. This absent object may be evoked through imitative play activities, mental images, graphic images, physical gestures, or verbal actions. These functions appear toward the end of a child's second year and in crease in complexity through the sixth year when they are incorpo rated into more concrete operations which combine representation and abstract thinking. A study was undertaken in the Washington, D.C, elementary schools to discover new approaches to reading that would take advantage of the child's symbolic thinking and employ language and images relevant and credible to children, particularly disadvantaged children.

Consequently, otherwise normal reactions become overcharged with energy and result in anti-social modes of response, or else less adequate responses are utilized to relieve the tension state. The fault lies in the type of behavior utilized rather than in any fundamental physio-organic disorder.

      "title": "Codes of nonverbal behaviour",
      "abstract": "Verbal communication skills are one of the most important prerequisites for communication competence of each individual. It is well known that good communication is the foundation of any successful relationship, whether familial, romantic or professional. A significant part of the communication that takes place between people is nonverbal. Even when people stop speaking, they do not cease to communicate, because their bodies are constantly sending information about themselves. These signals may indicate the current emotional state of the speaker, but they can be misunderstood. Therefore, understanding nonverbal communication can and should be a key to effective communication. The rules of nonverbal communication are acquired through socialization and vary significantly between cultures, and even within the same culture. Verbal code, used in the appropriate syntax, has a denotative meaning. If during verbal communication, we hear a word we do not understand, we can look it up in the dictionary. For interpreting nonverbal communication, vocabulary does not exist. If someone approaches, touches us, is being quiet, or is staring at us, we can only guess the reasons and significance of these moves. Nonverbal communication, no matter how short it lasts, is inevitably accompanied by verbal communication. Nonverbal language can be intertwined with verbal language and may complement it, accent, substitute, repeat or even contradict it. Understanding of nonverbal communication codes is, therefore, a key factor in the process of communication, both among members of the same culture, and between members of different cultures, and as a result it is expected to achieve intentional didactic, economic or political goals. Bearing in mind that codes of nonverbal communication overlap and can confuse the communicators, the aim of this paper is to provide a systematic division of the existing non-verbal codes.",

      "title": "Postponement Behavior as a Function of Approach and Avoidance Motivation",
      "abstract": "Human behavior frequently involves planning in relation to interpersonal events scheduled to occur in the near future. A person may be required publicly to commit himself to participate in an impending event at some preferred point in time; thus, for example, he may freely elect to postpone his response rather than perform it immediately. One would generally expect postponement behavior to bear predictable relationships to the strength of relevant motives, particularly when these motives are incompatible with each other. This paper tests two deductions drawn from application of Miller's (1944, 1959) conflict model to postponement behavior. Specifically, the stimulus-similarity axis of the conflict model is identified with the future time dimension, along which some conflict-evoking event may be located. The hypotheses concern S's tendency to postpone his voluntary participation in the event, as a function of the strength of conflicting motives. In order to derive specific testable hypotheses consider first that S commits himself, in the immediate present, to take part in an event which is to occur at some point in futur'e time, and that he may either participate immediately or postpone his participation to some specified degree. Consider also that chis event will be both rewarding and punishing to respective degrees explicitly stated beforehand by E. If it is assumed that a temporal gradient of reward exists, then, the more imminent the event, the stronger will be the acquired approach to it al the instant of commitment.

But in coming to understand nonsocial objects, predictions about the behavior of those objects may be made with out concern for how those predictions may themselves alter the behavior of the objects. For example, predicting the weather is inherently fallible, because the system is so complex that very minor perturbations can have major unanticipated effects. But the predictions of weather scientists are not part of the system, and actions emanating from them do not affect the behavior of the system in any way. In contrast, a person within a social group of two or more people acts always with the knowledge that her own action may influence the actions of others in ways that she must be able to predict if she is to act intelligently.",

      "abstract": "In simple mechanical events, our visual system is able to automatically infer the causal stucture of events and yield causal impressions. Physical cues (especially spatiotemporal features of the display) are found to be the key factors of the causal perception. Here we demonstrate that cues of a completely different domain – the social cues -- also impact the causal perception of physical events: the causally ambiguous events are more likely to be perceived as causal if the faces super-imposed on the objects change from neutral to fearful. This effect has following three major properties: (1) the effect is caused by the social information, because it disappears when the faces are inverted or when the expression-changes are unreasonable; (2) merely the change of basic physical features, such as color and shape, can not influence the causal perception; (3) the social cues are integrated in a temporal window different from physical cues; (4) the social cues impact the perception process rather than the decision process as the impact also appears in the causality-induced illusion. These findings suggest that the visual system also relies on social information to infer the causal structure of the physical world. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2012",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, the author of a history or saint's life identifies him or herself in such a way as to authenticate the truth and quality of the material. Positioning counts: that of a courtier or family member or disciple or army-follower. The writer claims to know the subject but modes of asserting this may vary: education, intellect, access to written sources, may count or, in the case of hagiography, may be discounted in favour of a different familiarity. The claim may of course be tacit, as when a writer continues someone else's work and inherits his authority by default. In a well-functioning work, the self-identifying trope is tacitly or overtly matched to need, and this remains largely true of those sophisticated eleventh-century and twelfth-century histories where the historian freely writes himself or herself into events. The difference is that options have increased; the self-identifying can take as many forms as phases of the narrative require and any of these may function in more ways than one. Of course, some functions may be extra-textual: they may be personally or politically driven, as when Michael Attaleiates lauds Botaneiates, or Michael Psellos idealizes Michael Doukas and his son, or when Anna Komnene shakes her fist at Alexios's successors.

      "abstract": "When people experience the death of loved ones, some of them report after-death communications (ADCs) in which they have the impression of again encountering those loved ones by means of different types of visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and/or sentient phenomena. There is one particular type of ADC that can be referred to as a bereavement detachment experience (BDE) because the experient has the impression of being out of and/or away from their physical body during that encounter. Despite the general absence of an imminent threat or a near-death condition associated with a BDE, there are a number of similar features that are also found in reports of the NDE, such as encountering and communicating with deceased loved ones, venturing through a dark place or a tunnel, seeing or entering into a bright light, entering into transcendental otherworldly environments, and feelings of love or peace. This is an exploratory study of the BDE in which seven case examples are examined for a possible thematic pattern and then analyzed for their similarities and differences with the NDE. The aftereffects of the BDE are also explored as a beneficial psychological outcome for the experient. The findings of this study have therapeutic implications with important insights for those providing care to the bereaved.",

      "title": "The Foot of Compassion and Complicity",
      "abstract": "Sym-pathy or com-passion means sharing pain or trouble. Foot and shoe are often employed to denote sympathy as in “If I were in your shoes.” Foot and shoe, albeit less often, can also be a means to represent complicity, which means folding clothes together. People sometimes have to avoid bad memory or situations and want a closer and more personal bond with like-minded people, so that they together forge fictional scenarios that account for hard situations to them. The main objective of this essay is to explore aspects of the liaison between shoe-foot and compassion-complicity in various cultural and textual sources. 1) The pure sympathy or firm ties and its opposite cases are rather simply represented by one’s putting on the same shoes and taking them off respectively. 2) A shaky and unstable bond is indicated by the abnormal or weak foot which impedes walking itself. The self-exiled 20th Irish modernists, Joyce and Beckett, invent walking obstructions such as flat-foot and disabled feet in the depiction of their ambivalent attitude toward the fatherland. 3) Sylvia Plath’s “Daddy” and Sharon Creech’s Walk Two Moons can be said to present certain cases of the complicitous relationship. Mentally stricken, Plath had maintained an imaginary life in the dead father’s boots for 30 years, and, when that relationship was not needed any more, decided to quit her life for good. In Creech’s novel, the two young female classmates whose mothers have equally vanished from home join the complicity which makes them take their situations for a conspiracy-induced one. Only when they wear others’ “moccasins to walk two moons,” their understanding of others can be turned from the narrow and self-serving one to a truly sympathetic one.",

      "title": "Sensory States and Sensory Objects",
      "abstract": "Philosophers of Mind often characterize experiences (or sensations) as functional states of an organism. Experiential states-whether somatic states, like having a toothache, or perceptual states, like hallucinating a dagger, are functionally defined in terms of their typical occasions and manifestations (see [4], [14], [16]). Having a toothache is that state which is customarily brought about by damaged or decaying teeth, and which typically results in howls, winces, pain reports, and the like. Being perceptually aware of a dagger is that state characteristically induced in normal observers by retinal irradiation caused by daggers under normal lighting conditions. And so on. That's one way to talk about experience. A well known alternative is the analysis, which embraces a distinction between the act or state of experiencing and the entity which is directly experienced; items such as pains, itches, visual sense-impressions and afterimages are the usual examples of objects with which organisms are, on this view, en rapport during the appropriate experiences. Act-object theories foster well known puzzles: What precisely is the ontological status of sensory objects (whether pains or sense-data)? Do such entities exist when unsensed, or do they just spring into existence concomitant with an appropriate act of experiencing? are they located? How does our knowledge of sensory objects relate to our knowledge of ordinary physical objects? Alternatives to act-object theories, such as the functionalist account, generate fewer metaphysical problems. When the dentist, probing around in my mouth, asks Where exactly is the pain?, we need not construe him as inquiring after the whereabouts of a certain entity, an ache or pain. To have a toothache is to be in a certain experiential state-a state characteristically brought about by damaged dental tissue. When the dentist finds the right tooth-thus sending me through the ceiling-he need not be thought of as having found the place wherein resides a pain; he has rather found the portion of my body causally responsible for my being in the state in question. On such an approach, the phenomenon of",

      "abstract": "Childhood sexual, physical, or emotional abuse can result in splitting many aspects of the emotional and rational sides of a person. Commonly the emotions become confused and difficult to name, and the rational side dominates as a survival mechanism. This can be exacerbated by simplistic teaching that suggests people need to choose to act in certain ways and ignore their emotions. Examples of biblical lament provide helpful models of integration between the rational and emotional sides, encouraging the naming of negative emotions before God, turning to God rather than away from God to an abuser. A realistic grasp of forgiveness and repentance enables wounded people to find healing as they work towards integrating emotions, rationality, and spiritual formation.",

Thus, politeness cannot be limited to form and is not restricted to the linguistic medium. There are linguistic/verbal as well as non-linguistic/nonverbal norms of politeness. Informative communication is mainly verbal, whereas rapport communication involves much non-verbal behaviour as well. Emotive communication, as Arndt and Janney (1985: 282) call it, ‘involves complexly interrelated verbal, vocal and kinesic activities’. These non-vocal manifestations complement the verbal manifestations in order to satisfy emotional nee-ds which appear to be basic in communication. Politeness, in a broad sense, is what is behind this concern for our emotional needs and those of the other person.",

A victim of wrongdoing may be angry, afraid, hurt and resentful; as a result, the victim may feel violated. Perceived wrongs may also make a victim feel violated. One issue that victims often have difficulty in coming to terms with is why they were wronged. The question has to do with making sense of – that is, finding out the reason for – what happened to them. Those who already have low self-esteem (that is, a misplaced or diminished sense of self-regard, self-confidence and self-respect and an inaccurate perception of themselves as rational and relational human beings) may find it particularly difficult to forgive (Novitz 1998: 311–13) – or may ‘forgive’ all too easily out of a lack of self-respect. With some types of wrongdoing, the victim may feel that the wrongdoer is implicitly communicating that the victim is worthless, a ‘thing’ (not a person) to be abused at will. Being wronged can be a psychologically destructive experience for a person, and can have harmful effects on the lives of others and even on communities.",

In their non­\nritualized form the processes merely are the ethophysiological anticipation of the \nnecessity of certain forms of action.

It furthermore involves the appreciation of \nthe situation in terms of the animal’s needs and the consequent choices of its \nbehavioral priorities. Roughly speaking, it is at the moment when this evaluation \nis done, when choices from alternative action courses and coping strategies have \nto be made, when a choice has to be carried into a decision of action, that an \naction tendency and the preparatory postural and physiological activation for it \ntake place that we recognize as emotional behavior (cf.

      "abstract": "In talking of using the media to mental health, we are up against a difficulty from the start. We cannot promote mental health in the same sense as we might an object or a personality not even in the same way that we might, in the interests of physical health, a diet or a set of exercises or even a life-style. The factors that contribute to the mental health of an individual or a society are too subtle, too tenuous; and the means by which they are achieved, on purpose or accidentally, are too diffused and too deeply enmeshed in our social roots to be easily affected by direct action. Even indirect action in this area is complex. Professionals in mental health might well decide that its interests would be served if, for example, more mentally handicapped people were shown in TV dramas to be leading comparatively normal lives, or if those who have nervous breakdowns were dealt with more sympathetically; they might think it better for characters to be shown coping with their problems mainly on their own or in their families, rather than invariably calling in a doctor. It might be thought a step forward, in our fragmented society, if there were more positive images of people living successfully on their own, rather than so often finding fulfillment only in a happy-ever-after partnership; it might help if someone with an alcohol problem were seen to tackle it successfully, rather than being portrayed only as a drunken lout. We could devise endless ways in which the media might further the cause of mental health; but there would be no obvious means by which we could induce editors and producers of programs to fall in with our wishes.",

      "abstract": "A man can't live with stability if he is isolated. Between himself and others, he has interactions, and through repetition of them he tries to be a member of a small group consisted of himself and others.When he finds himself in this group, he attains stability through the union of his true individual self with the group. With the stability of this base, he can face other new external objects in a positive way. In this sense, a small group is essential support to one's stability.It is the level of interactions between them that decides the degree of forming of a small group. One of the most primary interaction is, I think, the recognition and the perceptiveness between oneself and the others.There are four such levels:1) Self-need centered levelThe main purpose is to satisfy one's own wants mutually. When one's wants have been satisfied, interactions are finished. The most important point in this level is the result of the others action. Recognition and perceptiveness to others are not necessary. At this level there are interactions, but the group is not yet formed.2) Subjective levelThrough repetition of interactions, recognition and receptiveness are met. But, there is some subjective bias from which some confusion springs on the way to forming a group. This subjective bias results chiefly from the individuals self-defense and individuality synthesis.3) Objective levelUsually what is called the scientific method. It selects and catches from the others phenomena which can be reasonably applicable to a certain general standard. It is apt to neglect the synthetic function of the others as a whole. So they can't get sufficient recognition and receptiveness to others. As a result, forming a group is limited.4) Emphathetic levelThis is the method by which we recognize and recieve the whole synthetic function as it is, understanding the others not as the objects but as the subjects. When an interaction is done by this method, it will get deeper and it becomes more reasonable to understand each other as a human. The common domain of the Recognition and Receptiveness shows the maximum expantion. Here, the small group becomes the most mature one.In the practical formations of small groups, these levels are partly overlapped by each other. But this classification will give an effective method for the analysis and appreciation of a group and to the educational and critical direction to make a group mature. It also suggests that in studies about human, human-relations, and a group, the subjective synthesis function should be put at the center.",

This last factor is perhaps the most important of all: the presence of mind to orchestrate both one's own mental resources and habits, and the affordances of the outside world, in a way that optimises their ability to mesh with themselves and with each other.

Human activities in general are not satisfied with the banality induced by repetition and the perfect knowledge that frequent acts bring, but they are guided more by a desire for innovation or progress, in other words, by a more or less chaotic tendency toward types of rare actions at a given moment. In many cases, the rare act can be considered as the goal of frequent acts, as something that gives them meaning and which, by transcending each of them, proves to be invaluable in moments of doubt, fatigue, and despondency.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews four types of personality disorders. Narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive personality disorders. Here is a brief introduction to these four personality disorders: The avoidant personality disorder is defined by a constant feeling of inadequacy. Patients with this disorder are hepersensitive to negative situations and they fear of being criticized of rejected. Thus, they avoid social and cultural interactions. They have limited themselves into a small line of close friends. The narcissistic personality disorder can cause great difficulties in interpersonal relationships, especially marriage. This is because narcissists are always self-righteousness and the world should revolve around them. Narcissistic people are not able to love others. They do not understand love (they constantly ridicule others and humiliate their subordinates). However, they take advantage of concept of love in order to deceive and trap others but it is all theatrics and role-playing. People with dependent personality disorder typically rely on others for their needs. They expect that others accept responsibility for most important issues in life. They lack self-confidence. They feel intense dissatisfaction whenever they feel lonely, even for a short time. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is presented by discipline-oriented perfectionism and psychological control. The individuals with this disorder try to be in control of everything through careful attention to norms, details, lists and programs. They are extremely careful, repeat every task for several times, and pay special attention to details and frequently resolve probable mistakes. They do not pay attention to the fact that other people feel upset in case of delays and discomfort that arises from their excessive behavior.",

For all animals some basic communication is possible by means of visual and auditory signals; what distinguishes humans from other animals is the use of a language for communication. The ability to use a language in its spoken and written form is essential for anyone seeking an effective role in society. The necessary language skills are acquired without too much difficulty, and often taken for granted, by the majority of people. However, for a minority there is some handicap which makes communication through language very difficult or in some cases impossible.

      "title": "The enigmatic phenomenon of loneliness",
      "abstract": "Much has been said and written on loneliness, which is a common human phenomenon that belongs to everyday existence, but few attempts have been made to capture the phenomenon and its existential meaning without reducing its complexity. This paper addresses the question: What is loneliness, what is its essence? The study practiced a phenomenological approach, called Reflective Lifeworld Research. Twenty-six interviews were analysed for meaning with the aim of describing an essential structure for the phenomenon, showing what loneliness is. The analysis shows that the phenomenon of loneliness stands out in meaning as figure against a background of fellowship, connectedness and context. One is lonely when important others are not there, because either one has rejected them or they have chosen to be rejected and left the person behind, feeling lonely. One can reject others in favour of another kind of connectedness. Such loneliness is restful and pleasant. It involves the lack of tangible context that other present people can offer, yet a context is not missing*in this instance there is a relationship to and one is part of something else such as nature or animal fellowship. Involuntary loneliness on the other hand involves a lack of context and connectedness. To be involuntarily lonely and not belonging to anyone is to lack participation in the world. To not be. Loneliness as a phenomenon is further characterized as transcending the present situation containing loneliness. One can feel lonely even if there are many people around, or one can be completely alone without feeling lonely. Loneliness can disappear with a sense of belonging, when one connects with someone who is miles away. Key words: loneliness, phenomenology, lifeworld, Reflective Lifeworld Research",

      "abstract": "The people in this situation were faced with an option to help someone in distress, and they did not choose to offer aid. This is a dramatic example of a situation that people face every day. An encounter with a beggar on the street, a request to give blood, or a call from a friend who is lonely or depressed—each is a situation in which someone can do something to benefit someone else. Such activity may be termed positive social action. Such acts as donating money or goods to charity, cooperating with others in carrying out a project, and doing favors for a person in need are typical examples of positive social action. Behavior of this kind may be contrasted with antisocial action, such behavior as aggression, destruction, and selfishness. Some theorists use the term prosocial behavior to stress the contrast with antisocial behavior. Other theorists prefer to use the term altruism, to emphasize the element of selflessness that exists in many helping situations. Altruism is action that benefits other people and is carried out with no expectation of external reward. Whatever words are used and with whatever emphasis, however, such action is worth investigating because it is deemed morally admirable and also contributes to the survival of society (Poplawski, 1985). Most people admire the individual who makes sacrifices so that others may benefit, and probably everyone agrees that society would be better off if everyone were less self-centered.",

      "title": "Activation of Magical Thought",
      "abstract": "A direct encounter is often very difficult for an autistic child, to such an extent that contact can trigger in him the sense of disappearing. Through splitting and psychic dispersion, the child has an associative, possibly drifting, mode of thinking, rather than logical, contextualized thought. When verbal language emerges, the associative context of the chosen word can be verbalized before the word itself can be pronounced. The safety of a detour through a nonhuman environment and the experience of the floor or solid edges in a space are reassuring because they are stable and can be anticipated, before an investment of movements in space or in the relation is bearable and understandable. The authenticity of the therapeutic relationship facilitates the transformation from a state of false self into an adjustment between internal emotional experience and its expression. The therapeutic relationship allows the perception of changing emotions to be understood in a more reassuring context. But autistic children prefer nonhuman objects in the environment, and they interchange them with the surrounding human world to the point of indifferentiation. The link with nonhuman objects in the environment may be established through magical thinking, particularly as concerns their movements and relocations. Autistic people tend to master them, when human movements are too unpredictable and unmanageable. The investment of the bond (when it is built with confidence, security, and predictability) is the condition for a better investment of the space, the movements and the relocations. In a therapeutic setting, the illusion that inanimate objects can relocate themselves by magical thought may be a first step to a newfound confidence in the direct relationship. Magical thoughts concern in particular the movement of inanimate objects to improve the chances of attunement in the relationship. If the therapist at first accepts to dialogue with an autistic child within this interchangeability of human and nonhuman registers, an emotional sharing remains possible. The relationship with the child’s magical thoughts contributes to this emotional sharing, and reinvests the direct relationship more often and more spontaneously.",

These factors make humans indulge their lust rather than the way they are until their behavior is like an animal even more misguided.

      "title": "Punchinello or ‘on ambiguity’.",
      "abstract": "The relationship with emotionally symbolized “objects” underlying our relation with reality has connotations of ambiguity: a difficult daily mixture of emotions that lead us to experience the other as friend and  at the same time  as foe; as strong and  at the same time  weak;  as belonging within us, and  at the same time  as extraneous, outside us. We could go on and on.  Ambiguity, or rather what emotionally corresponds to what we call ambiguity, is the original mode in which the mind’s unconscious mode experiences the relationship. Friend and foe, outside and inside, powerful and weak, present and absent are, after all, descriptive categories that help us to talk, albeit in an approximate way, about emotional events that we are “forced” to communicate, even in this paper, through language. They are definitions, already organized and emotionally oriented, of what is experienced in the “logic of the emotions”, far removed from the logic that organizes language and gives it intention. The original ambiguity can induce anxiety; it justifies the propensity to “dissolve”, in one way or another, the ambiguous and therefore emotionally non-defined relationship with objects. Emotional acting out serves the purpose: when emotions are acted out, the object to which the acting out is addressed univocally becomes “friend” or “foe”, if the original ambivalence concerns this primitive symbolization pattern.  The dissolving of the ambiguity and the emotional acting out are temporally synchronic: there is no dissolution of ambiguity without emotional acting out; emotional acting out always entails a dissolution of ambiguity inherent to the symbolization of the object to which the acting out is addressed. If however the emotionally ambiguous symbolization is “thought”, then it is possible to elaborate an original ambiguity, and see its motivations, unravel its contradictions, construct a “dividing” idea which creates links between the various aspects of the originally ambiguous object. Accordingly, it can be said that the mind’s unconscious mode is manifested through emotional ambiguity, in the sense of an indefinite, contradictory emotional configuration of the objects one relates to. It is acting out, on the one hand, and on the other the thought that organizes and preludes to action, which lead to the emotional definition of objects and therefore to an organized relationship with them. It should also be remembered that original ambiguity is a resource for our knowledge of the object reality,  for a non-stereotyped adaptation that can relate to the ambiguous, and thus extraneous, object. Dissolving the ambiguity means transforming the object into an emotionally defined interlocutor, but at the cost of losing the possibility of exchanging with the extraneous. Dissolving the ambiguity means transforming the extraneous into an object that can be possessed, so there is a shift from exchange to possession. Tolerating the original ambiguity, associated with the objects of the relationship, is difficult. It entails the non-resolution of the object’s emotional indefiniteness, it therefore entails the capacity to establish relations with objects that have no definite configuration, from the emotional point of view, as “good” or “bad”, as “friend” or “foe”. The ritual components of cultures can be seen as ways of dissolving ambiguity in a reassuring style, channelled into common forms of relation, such as the ‘friend’ relationship. The difficulty of tolerating ambiguity is well-known in the psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy relationship, where the analyst’s silence may be hard to accept for the patient who right from the outset of the relationship  wants  to place the psychotherapist in the friend-foe pattern. The eroticization of the relationship, for example, can be a way of emotionally dissolving the ambiguity of the object in psychotherapy.  In an interpretation using the categories under study, psychotherapy can be seen as the story of the different ways of dissolving ambiguity, acted out in the analytical relationship. But also the daily experience of each of us in relating socially can be read through the categorization of the various ways of dissolving ambiguity encountered in our usual relationships. The rules of the game in relationships, the social roles, the configurations of power in relationships, the categories of knowledge of the other, are all modes designed to dissolve emotional ambiguity in a reasonably stable way,  inevitable  in any experience of relating. If for instance, ambiguity is dissolved with a friend-foe type reading, then one can relate to the extraneous other, source of ambiguity, using modalities of attack-flight, of dependency or of coupling, to use the Bion’s basic assumptions model. If on the other hand one tolerates the original ambiguity of the other, one can go through an experience of exchange where the dissolution of ambiguity will gradually become the outcome elaborated in the exchange itself. Think for instance of the ambiguous relationship with food in a country extraneous to us, like India. There are people who dissolve the ambiguity towards unknown food with a simple, repetitive category: spicy means foe. Hence the search for food that is “not spicy” in the homeland of spices. Hence also the impossibility of knowing a complex and variegated culinary universe, with the sole objective of avoiding an aspect of estrangement  (the use of spices, the flavour of spices) symbolized as foe. These processes of drastic and pragmatically violent reduction of ambiguity, on the other hand, are present in the daily experience of social relations in all cultures; so much so, that it makes the acceptance of ambiguity, the tolerance of it in a relationship, seem  utopian . In this article I want to explore the figure of Punchinello drawn by Domenico Tiepolo, as the artistic expression of ambiguity which characterizes the mind’s unconscious mode of being.  I think Domenico Tiepolo’s Punchinello figures are in fact emotionally undefined “objects”, capable of representing the ambiguity, the emotional indefiniteness typical of the unconscious. I also think that many works of art can be seen as attempts to give emotional ambiguity a clear and explicit emotional dissolution; many others, instead, can represent the expression of ambiguity which has the effect in the viewer of suspending the participation in the emotional dichotomies of friend-foe, in-out, above-below, front-back, i.e. in the emotional dichotomies behind the most primitive dissolutions of ambiguity. Examples of the first function attributed to art can be found in works of religious divulgation, such as the frescoes on the walls of the cathedral of San Geminiano conceived to spread the knowledge of the new and old testaments to the faithful. But also the “didactic” and predicatory works of a certain type of contemporary art: just to take one example, garbage put up as an object to contemplate and meditate on.  Examples of the second function are found in artworks that do not provide an explicit or implicit emotional resolution, such as abstract art at its best, as in a Kandinskij and a Mondrian, in Malevich’s suprematism, but also in Arman’s  nouveau realisme  with his  assemblages  of broken violins, paintbrushes, clocks or tubes of paint. This is the Arman dear to Umberto Eco, who says that he “transforms the monody of the identical into the symphony of the heterogeneous”.",

The apparent contradiction dissolves when we explore the geography of a multileveled zone in which informational signals or stimuli emanating from a variety of salient environments interact with the person's intentions to behave-in which environment and behavior in fact become interdependent, the consciousness or awareness of ordinary human beings as they maneuver their way through everyday social life. To begin exploratory mapping of this complex territory, eight levels of awareness are posited, each appropriate to a distinct salient environment; each having a specific information-feedback apparatus; and each with a unique \"mode of awareness\" or state of mind characteristic to it. All eight levels are routinely called into play in ordinary social interaction; we can only celebrate the dexterity and virtuosity of human capability.",

Whether nonlinguistic creatures encode similar thoughts is an open question, as everyday behavior marked by absence (of food, of social partners) can be explained solely by expecting presence somewhere else. We investigated 8-day-old chicks’ looking behavior in response to events violating expectations about the presence or absence of an object. We found different behavioral responses to violations of presence and absence, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Importantly, chicks displayed an avian signature of novelty detection to violations of absence, namely a sex-dependent left-eye-bias. Follow-up experiments excluded accounts that would explain this bias by perceptual mismatch or by representing the object at different locations. These results suggest that the ability to spontaneously form representations about the absence of objects likely belongs to the initial cognitive repertoire of vertebrate species.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As Goffman (1967) Goffman, E. 1967. Interaction ritual., Harmondsworth: Penguin. [Google Scholar] remarks: “[if] the minute social system that is brought into being with each encounter [becomes] disorganized ... participants will feel unruled, unreal, and anomic” (p.135). In other words, if we and our interlocutors are to communicate readily and easily, we rely on those with whom we are involved to sustain the sense of a collective-we between us, a shared reality that is our reality. And it is only in relation to such a shared reality that we can express to each other who we are, express the nature of our unique inner lives to each other. To an extent, we owe our very being, our identity, to it. If it collapses, then it is quite easy for us to feel unheard, or unable to express ourselves. Is there something wrong with us? Or with the world? If we are to sustain the sense of a collective-we, then we find ourselves with, as Goffman notes, certain “involvement obligations,” or “interactive responsibilities,” to our joint affairs: only if you respond to me in a way sensitive to the relations between your actions and mine can we act together as a collective-we; and if I sense you as not being sensitive in that way, that is, as not being responsive to me, but as pursuing an agenda of your own, then I will feel immediately offended in an ethical way. I will feel that you lack respect not only for our affairs, but for me too. In such circumstances, not only do I feel insulted, but I lack the social conditions necessary to express myself, the nature of my own inner life. In psychotherapy, in which it is the task of therapists to explore the unique inner lives of their clients, this is disastrous. Yet, in the pursuit of a technical agenda, it is only too easy to ignore the intrinsic “involvement obligations” present to some extent in all our exchanges with others, and as a result, to disrupt or disturb them in their very being,in who they are for us.",

Because humans appear to use social groups as units to explain social activities, we proposed that a socially defined group, according to social interaction information, would also be a possible object of attentional selection. This hypothesis was examined using displays with and without handshaking interactions. Results demonstrated that object-based attention, which was measured by an object-specific attentional advantage (i.e., shorter response times to targets on a single object), was extended to two hands performing a handshake but not to hands that did not perform meaningful social interactions, even when they did perform handshake-like actions. This finding cannot be attributed to the familiarity of the frequent co-occurrence of two handshaking hands. Hence, object-based attention can select a grouped object whose parts are connected within a meaningful social interaction. This finding implies that object-based attention is constrained by top-down information.",

When they are considered as his own, then is he called a natural person: and when they are considered as representing the words and actions of another, then is he a feigned or artificial person. 1 Hobbes' distinction between the two forms of personation may serve set forth the common ground, as well as mark the boundary, between two modes of theatricality: the sustaining of a feigned person-or mimicry-and the emphatic maintaining of one's own person, or self-manifestation. The Oxford Dictionary supplies similar coordinates for the verbs and act, which may mean either sustain a feigned character, make a pretence, act deceitfully -i. e., engage in mimicry or hypocrisy -or, more neutrally, pursue a course of action, to perform a function -to go about one's business in a normal manner. A man who has played his part has done what was expected of him; he has fulfilled the obligations contracted by performing similar actions in the past. But most men play their parts somewhat inexpertly; they fail coincide exactly with their assumed roles. And our language contains various expressions of disapproval for those who too grossly misplay themselves. Terms like showing off, playing the gallery, upstaging, making a scene, making a spectacle of oneself, all refer an insistence on being at the center of attention. The same notion appears in other languages: in Italian, for example, sta sempre sul podio -he's always on a platform -refers bitingly the man who cannot do without an audience.

      "title": "More Than Just Another Pretty Face: Embodied Conversational Interface Agents",
      "abstract": "Introduction Both animals and humans manifest social qualities. Dogs recognize dominance and submission, stand corrected by their superiors, demonstrate consistent personalities, and so forth. On the other hand, only humans communicate using language, and carry on conversations with one another. And the skills of conversation have developed in humans in such a way as to exploit all of the unique affordances of the human body. We make complex representational gestures with our prehensile hands, gaze away and towards one another out of the corners of our centrally-set eyes, and use the pitch and melody of our flexible voices to emphasize and clarify what we are saying. Perhaps because conversation is so defining of humanness and human interaction, the metaphor of face-to-face conversation has been applied to human-computer interface design for quite some time. One of the early arguments for the utility of this metaphor gave a list of features of face-to-face conversation that could be fruitfully applied to human-computer interaction, including mixed initiative, non-verbal communication, sense of presence, rules for transfer of control ([9]). However, although these features have gained widespread recognition, human – computer conversation has only very recently become more than a metaphor. That is, it is only just recently that designers have taken the metaphor seriously enough to attempt to design a computer that could hold up its end of the conversation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The partiality we display, in so far as we form and sustain personal attachments, is not normatively fundamental. It is a by-product of the deference and responsiveness that are essential to our engagement with the world. We cannot form and sustain valuable personal relationships without seeing ourselves as answerable to the other participants in those relationships. And we cannot develop and sustain valuable projects without responding to the constraints imposed on our activities by the nature and requirements of those projects themselves. More generally, we cannot engage with the world without responding differentially—or displaying partiality—with respect to the objects of our engagement. Partiality is thus a by-product of engagement. We cannot engage with the world at all without exhibiting forms of partiality.",

      "abstract": "orgasm. Paraphilic syndromes may be either harmless or noxious. In either case they belong to the first two of the three-phase sequence of mammalian pair-bonding and erotosexuality , namely, proception and acception. Proception is the phase of mutual arousal, attraction, solicitation, and courtship. Acception is the phase of mutual participation in body contact, especially contact with the sex organs. Acception may be followed by conception, the third phase, which includes pregnancy, parturition, and parenthood. There are paraphilias of displacement and paraphilias of inclusion. In a displacement paraphilia, a stimulus image that is typically a phyletic component of the erotosexual sequence of arousal and orgasm usurps the place of other components and assumes inordinate or exclusive power. For example, in frotteurism the stimulus of fondling, rubbing, and stroking a partner is displaced from being a component of a relationship with a known, or at least compliant, partner and instead is directed to a stranger in an anonymous crowd and becomes of paramount importance, in imagery",

      "abstract": "Ghost touching. How the imaginary body of cognition makes invisible contact with people and things. Language provides humans with an imaginary physiology of thought and social interaction which is reflected in a number of fixed form expressions. Scenes of perception, socio-physical contact and interpersonal manipulation are routinely evoked in which humans interact with other humans or objects. The interactions are set in fictive conceptual or social space. Thus language makes it possible for speakers-cognizers to touch or make (physical, mental, social) contact with people and things (real or imaginary, concrete or abstract). A corpus study of the socio-physical uses of touch in English, and its derived adjectival or participial forms, reveals the extent to which primary sensory-motor scenes have been recruited to code other scenes in the pragmatic and epistemic domains. Language plays a crucial role in this socio-cognitive process since it is the symbolic apparatus of language that shapes and controls the idealized (or imaginary) body of cognition (IBC) -the invisible body involved in a repertoire of ghost perceptions and motions (like sensing, seeing, grasping, going, moving, shifting, etc.). Fictive acts of touching are part of this repertoire. Here as elsewhere, the imaginary sensory-motor activity of the IBC follows the strict stage-directions layed out by language. The moves and attitudes typically involve the hands, fingers, eyes and feet. After a detailed examination of lexical expressions coding socio-physical contact, the discussion shifts to grammatical manifestations of this cognitive mechanism with special attention devoted to the performative contact principle, as revealed by the syntax of pidgin or child language (e. g. Me do it !). The article closes with a demonstration of how scenes of manipulation and touching can be acted out to make sense of language structure and functioning.",

      "abstract": "Summary Absence is a notion that is usually captured by language-related concepts like zero or negation. Whether non-linguistic creatures encode similar thoughts is an open question, as everyday behavior marked by absence (of food, of social partners) can be explained solely by expecting presence somewhere else. We investigated 8-day-old chicks’ looking behavior in response to events violating expectations about the presence or absence of an object. We found different behavioral responses to violations of presence and absence, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Importantly, chicks displayed an avian signature of novelty detection to violations of absence, namely a sex-dependent left-eye-bias. Follow-up experiments excluded accounts that would explain this bias by perceptual mismatch or by representing the object at different locations. These results suggest that the ability to spontaneously form thoughts about the absence of objects likely belongs to the initial cognitive repertoire of vertebrate species.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, I will argue that, contrary to what is generally assumed in the debate on expressive action, we do not have good reasons to exclude facial and bodily expressions of emotion such as smiling or frowning from the category of actions. For this purpose, I will compare facial and bodily expressions of emotion with simple expressive actions, such as jumping for joy or covering one’s face in shame. I will try to show that simple expressive actions cannot be presented as actions while excluding facial and bodily expressions of emotion from this condition. My contention will then be that either both sorts of behaviour are to be identified as actions or neither is. The latter sounds rather implausible, though, as we would have to assimilate jumping for joy or covering one’s face in shame to spasms, which conflicts with the way we relate to such behaviours. My conclusion will then be that both simple expressive actions and facial and bodily expressions of emotion should be included within the category of actions, at least on the basis of the main assumptions in the current debate on expressive action.",

Such pictures are various and may be in sharp opposition to each other; and one and the same individual may be captivated by different and sharply conflicting pictures at different times. At one time it may seem to him that he should live—even that a man should live —in such-and-such a way; at another that the only truly satisfactory form of life is something totally different, incompatible with the first. In this way, his outlook may vary radically, not only at different periods of his life, but from day to day, even from one hour to the next. It is a function of so many variables: age, experiences, present environment, current reading, current physical state are some of them. As for the ways of life that may thus present themselves at different times as each uniquely satisfactory, there can be no doubt about their variety and opposition. The ideas of self-obliterating devotion to duty or to the service of others; of personal honour and magnanimity; of asceticism, contemplation, retreat; of action, dominance and power; of the cultivation of “an exquisite sense of the luxurious”; of simple human solidarity and co-operative endeavour; of a refined complexity of social existence; of a constantly maintained and renewed affinity with natural things—any of these ideas, and a great many others too, may form the core and substance of a personal ideal.",

Sensory impressions may be projected onto other persons, objects, or imagined objects; these phantom sensations also demand discharge through actions.

      "abstract": "acan's well-known aphoristic formulations that is desire of and the uncon- scious is discourse of necessarily entail that human subject is a social subject. Coming to life inevitably among language users, subject is constructed in an identification with signifiers of language—with letters, sounds, detached words and phrases—which become elements of uncon- scious, organized in a syntax of metaphor and metonymy. The child addresses demands to mother or caretaker in signifiers and is addressed through signifiers which henceforth mark and deter- mine desire. Entering into social exchange through language, desire pursues an object beyond whatever would fulfill subject's immediate needs, its satisfac- tion never adequate to love it wants. The uncon- scious is discourse of Other, because signifiers motivate and carry subject's desire, forming asso- ciative networks and chains that remain material of an unknown, that is, repressed, memory. Language takes form by excluding Thing, lacking substance of complete enjoyment, or jouis- sance, whose absence is occupied by mother as Other and covered over by object of drive, objet a, that is detached from body. The subject identi- fies with lacking object and thereby tries to attain an impossible jouissance. Desire is desire of Other, because subject wants to be what lack- ing Other desires; its desire is an answer to ques- tion of Other's desire. It is as a prohibition of that Other, mother whose desire subject questions and wants to answer to, that Name of Father is introduced, propelling subject into language by forbidding ultimate jouissance of incest. In process of castration, subject gives up project of filling Other's lack and takes on a sexual position as masculine or feminine, its jouissance reduced to lim- ited pleasures. In nuclear family of modern, West- ern cultures, castration operates through Oedipus complex, and it will take different forms in different kinship systems, but castration or incest prohibi- tion must function in subject formation as Law that is prerequisite for any social being ruled by particular social laws. The Freudian myth of primal father makes leg- ible necessity of incest prohibition at origin of social organization, as does Lacan's assertion that ten commandments derive from incest prohibition and that moral law is law of language. Moustapha Safouan likewise argues that law of lan- guage—in other words, incest prohibition—is basis for social relation. The regulation of reciprocity in marriage, made possible by incest prohibition, is law of exchange that governs speech. But law that allows for social being cannot in itself determine what would be a more or less just society, nor can it predict what specific forms reciprocity will take in any given society, just that there be reciprocal exchange. So language of any given culture, even while it derives from universal prohibition, will carry weight of its accumulated experience, customs, and forms of domination, marking its specificity in master signifiers that will consequently mark desire and hence unconscious material of culture's subjects. In an increasingly global economy, master sig- nifiers of dominating international regime increas- ingly infiltrate local cultures and economies, introduc- ing new ideals for identification and new forms of coercion and reinforcing established forms of injustice. The global master discourse, because it has power to determine forms of social exchange universally, en- ters into unconscious processes of subjects everywhere to construct desire.

      "title": "Staging for Success: Preparing Environments for Productive Meetings, Trainings, and Workshops",
      "abstract": "Physical environment and people Physical settings can create cognitive and emotional reactions in people. In fact, many disciplines, including human ecology and environmental psychology, assert that environmental variables have an impact on human behavior. In ecological psychology, for instance, when the quality of the fit between human occupants and the physical environment is high, the people and the place are unified. Research on the restorative effects of the natural environment found that individuals report feeling rejuvenated and energized by the places that they occupy. Additionally, research on creativity suggests that people confined to a “featureless environment” do not perform to potential intellectually and emotionally. Environmental variables that may affect human behavior include the lack or the expansiveness of space; the location, shape, or temperature of a room; the texture and color of the walls and flooring; and the type and arrangement of furniture. Environmental variables may also include the absence or presence of natural lighting, windows with scenic views, and music or sounds that may be calming or distracting. Odors (e.g., the scent of flowers) may also conjure up images or set the mood in a given environment. Strong odors such as garbage, incense, strong perfume, or cologne may be distracting or off-putting. A person’s mood, attention span, and ability to focus may also be affected by color. For example, colors have the power to affect human senses by conveying meaning and presenting an atmosphere of pleasantness. Specifically, the cooler colors (blues, greens, and grays) create more passive participation, or a sense of coldness, while warm colors (such as reds and yellows) or light pastels tend to give a sense of warmth. From an environmental psychology perspective, extreme temperatures can reduce interpersonal attraction and interfere with successful task performance. For example, a study on hot and crowded areas found that participants in a room at normal temperature (72.4°F) reported feeling vigorous and comfortable, whereas individuals assigned to an overheated room (93.5°F) reported feelings of discomfort, fatigue, and sadness. High temperatures are also linked to loss of attention and productivity, and group members tend to be more aggressive when they are hot.",

      "title": "Degradation of (moral) values in the context of the ego ideal and the ideal ego",
      "abstract": "All conclusions about some psychological characteristics or content must derive from relations of social, or better yet, epochal changes and structure they create. General agreement - admittedly biased and without access to a constant fact which is not close to any transitional movements - that the times are unstable - does not end with a precise understanding of how much would that instability reflect on the formation of a stable character. It could be said that this particular level of structuration, which connects 'the external' and 'the internal', is consistently absent in most theories. This especially applies to our central self, our consciousness, the authoritative part of us that sets standards and has been wrongly equated with universal truths, general principles and something that is considered to be common to all people. All complexity of formation of the super­ego, as the lastly formed instance that is also responsible for the sense of duty or the sense of moral obligation, has always been a result of the current form of structuration and has always been realized, more or less, as a distorted memory of certain, quite determined, events that a subject was overwhelmed with. If we listen to our own tendencies toward instability, we will not fall into the trap which is often present when describing ourselves, i.e. the belief that we have 'a real self', common to all human beings, whose requests are more important than requests of all others. However, outside of dynamic psychology, it would be difficult to understand how Lacan's 'split entity' could ever have 'a real self' whose requests are, especially concerning morality, more important than all other requests. Human nature has most easily been introduced into the norm by those ideals that had insisted on denial, and are located in the ego ideal. When 'ideals' moved, usually behind a screen of freedom and urge for individualization, the pleasure returned to nature in the form of ego ideals that knew the answer to the question, 'What is good for a man's life?' It is, as a reality principle, located in egocentric context, but no longer as an individual excess, but rather as a general, universal truth. Individualism, as the supreme value, has allowed different people to keep different views on what is a good life. While the ego ideal extolled people to make a compromise in which, of course, they had to forgo nature for the sake of culture, ideal ego approves all bypasses of the law if it is good for the subject. It could almost be said that the system of ego ideal, which is valued less and less, makes values as they are. There is no degradation whatsoever because cancelling of differences and boundaries leads to uniformity where the difference between the right and wrong is reduced to personal good. 'An inner voice' that dictates duties to the subject and indicates where good and evil are in opposition as pure or impure, was suspended. Ideal ego is not an ally of the law because it does not care for the subject's well-being. Unlike it, the ego ideal was giving satisfaction by its realization. No matter how strange it might seem, the highest value in a man (moral values) is most deeply associated with the lowest, with his pure nature. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question, 'What is my true self?' to a man who wonders what it is human nature. For psychoanalysis, it is hard to accept that naive 'clear understanding of self' and own values, which starts from Plato. And that was particularly difficult when, instead of compensated narcissism in the ego ideal, he continued his life in the ideal ego.",

      "abstract": "SENSES' OTHER SIDESan initiaL pair of propositions: senses work in language, but are not original to, dependent on, or servile to it; and on account of that nonlinguistic basis of senses, many entities, maybe all, but at least far beyond language's reach, sense their worlds. 1Such propositions are simply that: possibly or even just intuitions or inferences; that is to say, they engage philosophical and ethical questions, at best, and become intellectual passatempo, at worst.Naturally, I want to argue for the former, because on the one hand, our own resources for understanding relations among entities in late antiquity and Byzantium are so incomplete and inarticulated that engagement with how we relate to and judge our own worlds is crucial.Patchwork, piecemeal, puzzling is our approach to the consistency of sense lives across living things, both in beings we easily assume have feelings (ourselves, animals) and those we assume do not (inert materials such as metals, for example).And so on the other hand, confronting our assumptions about life and our responsibilities can arise from historical investigations and determine both our attitudes toward the past and toward our common present.For these reasons, a highly provisional exercise that stretches the historical imagination and accords sense lives to others can be mutually beneficial. 2 My specific attention in this chapter is directed at the viscous in Byzantium.By that I mean (mostly, but not only) the molten: the state that wax, metal, glass, stone, and simi lar, can achieve when heat is applied to it, a state that can bridge the liquid and heated and that can also be the process in which fusion of otherwise separate materials can take place.The state between solid and liquid is always in process; almost no substance stays viscous.Something is always on the way to something else when in a state of viscos ity.In that mobile passage between states, essences are declared, as in alchemy's belief in the process of purification toward gold when some materials are melted and fused with others.One could take a lead on viscosity from a Christology of matter, because all matter can; for Christ's own blood, flowing and turning to gore, is the most significant precedent of all for Christian thinking on matter's sliding states and their holy mimesis. 3Mimesis is a deep need for humans and for all other entities. 4",

      "abstract": "In the human brain, simple molecules and complex circuits are constantly making decisions which are indispensable for our survival and also to accomplish a variety of daily activities such as walking, memorizing, conversing, composing music, painting or poetry.... All are the result of the integration of many neural systems that perceive many and simultaneous visual, tactile, auditory and/or mental stimuli. Once synthetized, they are immediately transmitted to the corresponding executive systems, thus completing the fascinating functional loop of decision-making: a) perception of stimuli or information which originate in the environment, b) selection and elaboration of the decision which is considered more appropriate or attractive according to personal experience or intuition and c) execution. If these neural nets have been damaged or haven failed to develop the mechanisms of facilitation or inhibition that govern them become unbalanced. If inhibition is reduced, excessive and violent behaviour is expressed as in patients suffering from manic phases. Conversely, if inhibition is excessive, decision making mechanisms are not operative. In either case, behaviour is not \"reasonable\" and does not follow prototypical patterns. All these processes must be the consequence of a constant molecular activity full of micro-decisions whose effectiveness depends on the histological and biochemical integrity of the neurons. This microenvironment is responsible for all types of decisions of all forms of life and represents one of the fundamental successes of evolution.",

Appeal, in turn, depends on tastes, which in contrast to goals and standards, tend to be unanalyzable, Hence, the Attraction emotions are the least cognitively complex of all emotions. Tastes are treated broadly and include attitudes and preferences, and the notion of an object is also broad, including anything that is evaluated qua object, meaning that even events or agents’ actions can be viewed as objects. Although issues pertaining to aesthetic judgment are raised, they are not the focus of Attraction emotions. The Attraction emotion identified depends on whether an object is evaluated as being appealing or unappealing and whether it is viewed as itself being capable of emotion. Crossing these dimensions leads to four emotion types: “Affection” and “Enmity” emotions, which pertain to emotion-capable (generally animate) objects, and “Appreciation” and “Distaste” emotions, which pertain to emotion-incapable (generally inanimate) objects.",

      "abstract": "The research aims to highlight how Imru' al-Qays's feelings were directed at him in many of his defensive tricks in poetry, and to show what is behind some of his claims of alleged virility; By entering the psychological world of Imru' al-Qays, following the methods of Adler and others who wrote in this direction, the inferiority complex is manifested in a person's constant feeling of his lack of others; Which makes him look at himself far from the real reality in order to exalt him or reduce it, and look at others with a look of malice and hatred or say a projective look; because he sees himself undesirable from the group to which he belongs; It involves himself, and escapes from the responsibilities of life, and when this feeling settles in himself, he resorts to making fun of others, or claiming an alleged linguistic heroism that appears in the constant desire to be superior to others, and thus he adopts a form of aggressive behavior; In order to prove himself, and achieve psychological satiation, a feeling of inferiority overtook the Qais because of his impotence.Therefore, he was keen to suggest to himself, before suggesting to others, that his girlfriends are silk, and this is a claim denied by reality and rejected by Arab customs, their protection and fear for their women; So flirting with him became nothing more than a dream, and the research proved that the claim of sexual virility in Imru' al-Qays is nothing but a compensatory means and a psychological trick to hide the feeling of inferiority that controls him, because of his impotence, or at the very least his inability to communicate with women in a manner befitting his alleged heroism.I followed the artistic approach to studying the poet's poetry, and the psychological approach to its importance in illuminating the text.",

      "title": "Autism and the Imagination",
      "abstract": "We associate much with the imagination: the power to evoke images of absent objects and people, to generate inner pictures of past events or memories, and to create artistic representations of important experiences and desires. We attribute the highest order of moral, intellectual, and emotional growth to the ability to engage the imagination; we see \"imaginative play\" as necessary for the development of empathy and thus healthy familial and social bonds. In art, such associations and attributions arise from a history of understanding the imagination as more than the passive ability to recollect images and instead as an active and transformative faculty of the mind. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and others argued that, through the productive or constructive power of the imagination, we literally create the world by giving order or larger meaning to seemingly disparate and discrete elements. In light of these notions, an impaired imagination might manifest itself in a lack of empathy, literal-mindedness, or a tendency to get caught up in the individual and distinct impression. Within a continuum of definitions that elevate the liberating (and humanizing) nature of the imagination, such qualities suggest profound limitations-and a vision of the world that closes off the possibility of great art and wisdom.",

      "abstract": "A right “minor hemisphere” does not exist as the right hemisphere is dominant for awareness (nosognosia), spatial attention, emotional regulation, facial and voice expressions, visual recognition, and topographical orientation. Without the right hemisphere, the world would be flat, deprived of general and spatial attentions, pointing preferentially to the right side of the space, lacking visual experiences and emotions, exhibiting diminished awareness of the self and environment. Clinical-related syndromes of the right hemisphere are unilateral spatial neglect, object and face visual agnosia, the anosognosia for hemiparesis and/or hemianopia, misidentification syndromes, mania, and other obsessions for the food and the body. Another key function of the right hemisphere is the modulation of the emotional processes of the linguistic communication (as prosody and facial expressions), and the tuning of some holistic aspects of language as the understanding of the abstract and figurative characters. The great mysteries of the right brain hemisphere concern the origin of the emotional nature of the human being, the way by which cognition interacts with perception and finally the human consciousness. Multidisciplinary researches in the domains of neurology, cognitive psychology, neuropsychiatry, functional neuroimaging, and neurophysiology will reveal in the future some of these mysteries.",

      "title": "The Role of Perception in Development beyond Infancy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Perception always has a role in development, as well as in ongoing behavior, because perceiving is the way we keep in touch with the world and what is going on around us. Perception never stops; it provides the information for ongo ing actions (even just sitting or standing), for planning, and for developing concepts and reasoning. It may be that the role of cognitive processes such as imagining and reasoning increases developmentally in proportion to one’s get ting information directly from ongoing events (we certainly make educational efforts to encourage them). Of course, what we learn verbally increases enormously as spoken, and then written, language is acquired. Does that mean that perceptual development ceases, or at least slows down, after infancy? Our answer is no. Potential new affordances never stop becoming available, nor do people of any age stop learning to perceive them. We have seen that as reaching, handling, and locomotion develop, encounters with the environment broaden and potential affordances multiply. New opportunities don’t stop with physical growth, they increase. The nervous system develops, as well as stature and muscles. Increasing experience provides a backlog of knowledge that breeds new opportunities. Environments change from home to school to scenes outside both, imposing new demands that lead to learning about new affordances.",

      "abstract": "Leo Kanner's (1) classic description of \"autistic disturbances of affective contact,\" or early infantile autism, suggested that autism was an inborn, congenital disorder in which a child comes into the world lacking the usual motivation for social interaction. His use of the word \"autism\" was meant to convey this selfcontained quality but was, in some respects, an unfortunate choice of term since it introduced some confusion with the earlier use of the word, which described the idiosyncratic, self-centered thinking of schizophrenia. In addition to the problems in social interaction, Kanner noted the difficulties his patients had with many aspects of symbolization, abstraction, and communication. When language was present, it was remarkable for its literalness as well as other unusual aspects such as echolalia and pronoun reversal. In contrast to the child's lack of interest in the social world, Kanner noted that there was often a remarkable oversensitivity to the inanimate world, e.g., oversensitivites to sounds or other stimuli and sensitivity to even minor environmental changes. Kanner's description has proven remarkably enduring and remains the fundamental basis of current definitions of autism.",

If we consider the main semiotic distinction between communication using icons, signals, or symbols (Peirce, 1955; Harnad, 1990; Deacon, 1997) we can identify different cognitive loads for each type of reference. The use and understanding of icons require instinctive behaviour (e.g. emotions) or simple perceptual processes (e.g. visual similarities between an icon and its meaning). Communication systems that use signals are characterised by referential associations between objects and visual or auditory signals. They require the cognitive ability to learn stimulus associations, such as in conditional learning. Symbols have double associations. Initially, symbolic systems require the establishment of associations between signals and objects. Secondly, other types of relationships are learned between the signals themselves. The use of rule for the logical combination of symbols is an example of symbolic relationship. Symbolisation is the ability to acquire and handle symbols and symbolic relationships.",

      "abstract": "In summary, then, moods are ordinary psychic phenomenon which serve important unconscious functions. Like the dream, a mood has a kind of necessary autistic structure to it: people who are in a mood, like persons who are asleep, are inside a special state where a temporal element is at play. They will emerge, like the dreamer, after the spell is over. Some moods, particularly those that are a part of a person's character, are occasions for the expression of a conservative object, as a conservative object is that internal self state that has been preserved intact during childhood often upon some breakdown between the child in relation to his parents. When a person goes 'into' a mood he becomes that child self who was refused expression in relation to his parents for one reason or another. As such, moods are often the existential registers of the moment of a breakdown between a child and his parents, and partly notate the parent's own developmental arrest, in that the parent was unable to deal appropriately with the child's particular maturational needs. What was a self experience in the child, one that could have been integrated into the child's continuing self development, was rejected by the parents, who failed to perform adequately as ordinary 'transformational objects', thereby destining a self state to be frozen by the child into a conservative object that fated such a state of being to be subsequently represented only through moods.",

Although these selves are rarely experienced as distinct (because they are held together by specific forms of stimulus information), they differ in their developmental histories, in the accuracy with which we can know them, in the pathologies to which they are subject, and generally in what they contribute to human experience.",

Based on this, in this paper it is postulated that there are somatizations that only indicate an excess, others that mimic a stimulus or an imaginary scene and others that symbolize an affective situation and complex links in conflict. To address them, it is proposed to study the relationship between perception, mark and representation, taking into account the relationship between the world, the body and the other.Like a banner on the street congratulating a graduation or announcing a private event, the process of condensation of the body, the world and the other is fixed on the skin or on an organ and exposed to all as a mark that can be perceived forever. Everything works as if that mark has been registered separately from the one that promotes words and language, has replaced it to face certain realities and has been linked to an innervation, an organ, a chemical reaction or a genetic expression. The person and the body of the analyst must allow themselves to be involved in that private event through a particular transference that must be understood and interpreted through analytical acts and a more active attitude than the traditional one, without losing sight of the most consistent knowledge of his theory and practice.",

Behavior essentially, therefore, possesses a social quality which need not be existent in conduct, although Dewey regards conduct as \"A social reaction in and because of environment.\" Whether behavior is regarded as action or reaction, it is patent that it must depend on at least two elements dealing with human organization. Behavior must be viewed in terms of structure and function.

In close relationships, we voluntarily make ourselves most vulnerable to another human being by linking the realization of our needs, aspirations, and hopes to the goodwill of our relationship partner (for related ideas, see chap. 17, this volume). Rendering ourselves vulnerable makes possible the profound sense of well-being that can be experienced in close relationships. But at the same time, the imperfection of any partner means that hurt or injury is virtually inevitable, and when it occurs, the hurt is particularly poignant precisely because we have made ourselves vulnerable.

      "abstract": "Abstract An unorthodox view of the function of primary process is presented with a view to enlarge, rather than diminish Freudian assumptions. One of the basic tenets of Freudian hypothesis was the supposed lack of influence of outside experience upon primary process functions. Yet we see demonstrated on a daily basis that primary process cognition is at work in any human interaction or experience. The mental structures of the self in interaction with the nonself is constantly monitored, added to, or subtracted from during contact with others. It is a prereflective mode that does not immediately rise into awareness. We give meaning to all interactions without necessarily reflecting upon them or even clarifying them to ourselves. Without allowing for such meaning to be integrated, we would lose or misinterpret large portions of our daily interactions. Flaws in communication occur every day and are demonstrable particularly in therapy when therapists are not attuned to their patients' emotional needs. It is demonstrated that nonverbal avoidance behavior of disturbed infants is the precursor for disturbed object relations of adults. Therefore, it makes no sense to interpret unconscious meanings—there are none. The difficulty lies in the inter-subjective realm and serves defensive modes. However, if patients present an inauthentic self, it is often difficult to decide if one is indeed in the presence of such a maimed self. The therapist's countertransference aids in detecting inaulhenticity. Ever-present, unconscious meaning analysis must be brought into consciousness by the therapist in order to further the therapeutic process.",

In his relations with other people, his body becomes a receiver, a receptacle and a source of communication. Social violence underlies relations with elderly people: such violence may be deceptive, widespread and continuous or, on the other hand, manifest, episodic and conspicuous. In the first case it may be a way of assigning subalternate roles to them in relation to the efficiency expected of them or a way of mythologizing their condition as one of pseudo-happiness. In the second case is generally relates to assaults, thefts, bag-snatching, etc. In any case, however, communication with them entails violence: their body perceives this and reacts to it.

After all, I cannot make a gift of my esteem, nor can I offer it in a trade with another person, nor can I pass on the esteem I receive from others. But while esteem itself may not be alienable in these ways, certain ‘esteem-services’ are: I can voluntarily offer you my attention, my testimony, and my company, and do so in a way that promises to increase your positive esteem.

      "title": "Bounded Rationality in Social Sciences",
      "abstract": "Approaches to different kinds of social interaction have been built on a very special model of human being, i. e., the rational optimizing decision maker.A better understanding of social interaction could be obtained from other notions of rationality, from a less abstract notion than the usual idea of optimizing means and ends that appears in these models. We need to move closer to bounded rationality, a There are very important links between procedural rationality (Simon´s view) and axiological cognitivist rationality (Boudon´s approach). Many procedures could be understood as frugal and simple mechanisms to put our values –values that are giving us reasons to act- into action. We are instrumentally rational agents, but we also exhibit axiological rationality. These are two different notions of rationality but we act with both of them in a single communicative situation.We do not need to suppose Olympic participants in the interactions, with absolute and common knowledge (each one knows what the others know); all we need is some flesh and blood human beings in contextual interactions. These real agents cannot be blurred; they must always remain at least as a parameter of the interaction. We here propose bounded axiological rationality (BAR) as an alternative to the habitual model of rationality. Combining certain ideas of H. Simon and R. Boudon with Amartya Sen’s proposal concerning informational filters, we claim that values, in addition to guiding or orienting actions, intervene as filters that restrict the perception of the environment and the choice among possible courses of action. From the point of view of bounded rationality, there are several models of practical rationality, one of which is synthesized in the theory of maximizing rational choice. However, by introducing values as a factor in the analysis of actions, their objectives, and their results, it is possible to establish differences among these models according to their greater or lesser degree of axiological rationality.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of behavior is sometimes considered irrelevant to the issue of human morality, since it lacks the normative character of morality (‘ought’), and consist entirely of descriptions of how things are or came about (‘is’). Evolved behavior, including that of other animals, is not entirely devoid of normativity, however. Defining normativity as adherence to an ideal or standard, there is ample evidence that animals treat their social relationships in this manner. In other words, they pursue social values. Here I review evidence that nonhuman primates actively try to preserve harmony within their social network by, e.g., reconciling after conflict, protesting against unequal divisions, and breaking up fights amongst others. In doing so, they correct deviations from an ideal state. They further show emotional self-control and anticipatory conflict resolution in order to prevent such deviations. Recognition of the goal-orientation and normative character of animal social behavior permits us to partially bridge the is/ought divide erected in relation to human moral behavior.",

      "title": "The biobehavioral interface in behavioral pediatrics.",
      "abstract": "Behavioral pediatrics begins, as a discipline, with at least two important assumptions: (1) that all human experiences have psychosocial as well as biological or organic contexts; and (2) that the biological substrate with which the child is born is modifiable. Thus, behavioral pediatrics, by its own definitions and assumptions, initiates research questions at the biobehavioral interface.1 This paper attempts to delineate a number of research directions that may be used to investigate the complex relationships between behavioral and biological factors in behavioral pediatrics. Research investigating biobehavioral processes can be approached on a number of different levels. The research can be organized in terms of the following specific causal assumptions relating behavioral and biological factors: (1) a parallel model; (2) a causal model in which behavioral factors influence biological factors; (3) a causal model in which biological factors determine behavior; and (4) a causal model in which there is bidirectional causality. 1. Parallels Between Behavior and Biology. This model assumes that there is no directional causality. Behavioral and biological factors represent parallel systems sharing a common underlying organization. Behavioral and physiological variables may be viewed as different levels of the same system, mediated by central nervous system processes. Various screening methods are based on this model. Research questions dealing with this model focus on indexing and predicting developmental outcome. Techniques such as the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale2 or the identification of sleep patterns3 evaluate behavioral patterns and attempt to identify neurophysiological or neurological dysfunction. Similarly, physiological response patterns such as infant cry patterns4 or heart rate variability measures such as cardiac vagal tone5 have been used to predict developmental outcome when the behavioral repertoire is too limited to be useful in predicting subsequent behavior.",

      "title": "Dog (Canis familiaris) – Human Communication: Domestication Effects, Showing, Perception Understanding and Deception",
      "abstract": "Living together with animals is cultural tradition among humans stretching back though out history. Therefore, it is not a surprise that some communication exists between these animals and humans. Domestication might have facilitated the animal’s understanding of human communicative signals. Dogs (Canis familiaris) seem to be especially skilful, and outperform apes in many tasks involving the understanding of human signals. However, also adult wolves (Canis lupus), the closed living ancestor of dog, show some capabilities in understanding human communication, which questions domestication as the only reason for the dogs extraordinary skills. The aim of this dissertation is to provide further insight into dog-human communication, the dog’s ability to understand its human partner, the intentionality of communicating, the understanding of the humans and conspecifics perception, and deceptive behaviour towards humans, while considering domestication, artificial selection, and experience effects. Pet dogs, pack dogs, and wolves (pack dogs and wolves having been raised and living under the same conditions) were confronted with the task to indicate a food location to either an uninformed human cooperator or competitor. Both dogs and wolves showed more gaze alternation and other food-directing behaviours in the presence of the cooperative than in the presence of the competitive partner. The pet dogs also used more misleading signals directing to an empty hiding place in the presence of a competitive partner and indicated the food location to the cooperator more than pack dogs. This finding suggests that dogs and wolves have an understanding about the role of the two partners and further, based on the results of the pet dogs, they might possess an understanding about the competitive partner’s intention to eat the hidden food. Based on the similar performance between pack dogs and wolves, as well as the difference between pack dogs and pet dogs it seems that rather life experiences than domestication is driving the dogs abilities in understanding human communication. Life experience was also influencing the dog’s attentiveness to human perception. Beside experience, genetic differences and working style played a role with being more attentive when assigned to the ancient or hunting dog type, or to the independent working or family dog style. However, when tested with a dominant conspecific no such breed group difference was found, but in both cases, when tested with a human or with a conspecific, the sensitivity to the perception of other could be confirmed. In competitive situations it can be advantageous for subordinate individuals to be able to deceive. When pet dogs are confronted with the task to guide a cooperative and a competitive human partner to one of three potential food locations (one containing the preferred, one the non-preferred food and one is remaining empty), they led from the first day on the cooperative partner to the preferred food box more often than expected by chance and more often than the competitive partner. The competitive partner, however, was led to the preferred food as often as expected by chance. During the second test day the effect was even stronger. These results indicate the flexibility of the dogs’ behaviour and suggest that they are able to perform tactical deception. The different studies revealed that when intensively socialised with humans and tested at an adult age no difference could be found between dogs and wolves raised and kept under the same circumstances. Therefore, domestication alone was not driving the dog’s more pronounced ability in communicating with humans. However, breed group differences as well as life-long experiences with humans substantially influence the dog’s performance in communicative tasks with humans. This emphasizes the importance to consider these effects in further studies on this topic.",

      "abstract": "In the cathegory of clothing which can be worn by the vegan public -that is, by those who abstain as much as possible from consuming products and services of animal origin for ethical and ideological reasons -there are various synthetic alternatives to materials of animal origin which fulfill the practical, aesthetic and/or symbolic functions.From burlesque copies to reliable imitations, like those of leather, feathers, fur, bones and animal secretionswith different degrees of realism, they haveat first, up close, or from a distance and/or to the eyes of laypeople, aesthetic and sensorial aspects that make it difficult to distinguish from genuine materials of animal origin.This study is a qualitative, exploratory, phenomenological investigation about the problematic of some of the most notable possible conceptual and practical implications, from the practical, aesthetic, philosophical, sociological and ethical viewpoints, of the idea of imitation, emulation and copying of materials of animal origin or materials which make a reference or allusion to, or which evoke exterior aspects of, animals' bodies in vegans' clothing.To this end, based on searches for vegan users' comments in online social media, questionnaires and in-depth interviews with users, vegan movement activists and theoretical specialists (like ethics philosophers and designers specializing in ethical fashion), the aim of this study, based on conclusions obtained through analysis of these different points of view, is to illuminate the fields of fashion design, veganism and consequently, animal rights.Results of this investigation suggest, for instance, that for some users, making use of alternatives considered vegan would be an acceptable practice because they would replace functional, aesthetic and even affective attributes of clothing and accessories that such users otherwise associate with pain, while for other users this option would be objectionable.According to some respondents, due to the reasonably high level of visual similarity of various types of such simulacra, merely employing these animal byproducts would be considered less acceptable, given their insufficiently discernible distinction from animal-body materials.In such instances, they felt this verisimilitude could indirectly foster the idea that the use of such animalorigin material would be acceptable, therefore contributing to promoting the consumption of clothing of a type which is against the principles they adopt.",

      "title": "Solidarity or objectivity?",
      "abstract": "There are two principal ways in which reflective human beings try, by placing their lives in a larger context, to give sense to those lives. The first is by telling the story of their contribution to a community. This community may be the actual historical one in which they live, or another actual one, distant in time or place, or a quite imaginary one, consisting perhaps of a dozen heroes and heroines selected from history or fiction or both. The second way is to describe themselves as standing in immediate relation to a nonhuman reality. This relation is immediate in the sense that it does not derive from a relation between such a reality and their tribe, or their nation, or their imagined band of comrades. I shall say that stories of the former kind exemplify the desire for solidarity, and that stories of the latter kind exemplify the desire for objectivity. Insofar as a person is seeking solidarity, she does not ask about the relation between the practices of the chosen community and something outside that community. Insofar as she seeks objectivity, she distances herself from the actual persons around her not by thinking of herself as a member of some other real or imaginary group, but rather by attaching herself to something which can be described without reference to any particular human beings.",

      "title": "Human infants are aroused and concerned by moral transgressions",
      "abstract": "Humans reason and care about ethical issues, such as avoiding unnecessary harm. But what enables us to develop a moral capacity? This question dates back at least to ancient Greece and typically results in the traditional opposition between sentimentalism (the view that morality is mainly driven by socioaffective processes) and rationalism [the view that morality is mainly driven by (socio)cognitive processes or reason]. Here, we used multiple methods (eye-tracking and observations of expressive behaviors) to assess the role of both cognitive and socioaffective processes in infants’ developing morality. We capitalized on the distinction between moral (e.g., harmful) and conventional (e.g., harmless) transgressions to investigate whether 18-mo-old infants understand actions as distinctively moral as opposed to merely disobedient or unexpected. All infants watched the same social scene, but based on prior verbal interactions, an actor’s tearing apart of a picture (an act not intrinsically harmful) with a tool constituted either a conventional (wrong tool), a moral (producing harm), or no violation (correct tool). Infants’ anticipatory looks differentiated between conventional and no violation conditions, suggesting that they processed the verbal interactions and built corresponding expectations. Importantly, infants showed a larger increase in pupil size (physiological arousal), and more expressions indicating empathic concern, in response to a moral than to a conventional violation. Thus, infants differentiated between harmful and harmless transgressions based solely on prior verbal interactions. Together, these convergent findings suggest that human infants’ moral development is fostered by both sociocognitive (inferring harm) and socioaffective processes (empathic concern for others’ welfare).",

Pretense presupposes some BIC-based human interaction, where a normal, practical behavior is used for signifying something, based on a sign that is not a conventional one. In light of BIC interaction theory, one can exploit this sign or message in a deceptive way in order to induce the other to believe that he/she is performing a given behavior or has a given mental state.",

      "abstract": "Human love can be either a passion of the sensible appetite or an act of the will. This second type of love, insofar as it is preceeded by a choice, is also called dilectio . This in turn may be of two types: love of possession (or of a thing), and love of communion (or of a person). By its very nature, the love of a thing is directed to the love of a person, and when this order is upset, certain aberrations make their appearance: either things are loved as if they were persons, or persons as if they were things, or finally persons are loved as persons but without wishing to do anything for them.\r\nThe three requirements for love are: good, likeness, and knowledge. The Good refers to the object of love, which is always some good, either a substance (person) or an adjective (thing). Likeness refers to the subject of love, and is either perfect (person) or imperfect (thing). Knowledge has to do with the relation subject-object, because nothing is loved if it is not first known.\r\nThe four principal effects of love are: union, mutual indwelling, extasis and zeal. Union, to a certain extent anterior to love, is also an effect of love, and the union is real to the extent to which it is possible: «two lovers wish to become one». The mutual indwelling is that by which the lover is in the loved one by knowledge and by desire and in the same way the loved one in the lover, so that each one can say: «I live, rather it is not I, but the other that lives in me». Extasis, or going outside oneself, is due to the fact that the lover is outside himself and lives in the loved one. And finally, zeal is a movement in defence of love, by which everything that threatens love is rejected.\r\nHuman love in the strict sense is the love between man and woman, and is a mixture of the love of a person and the love of a thing, because it refers not only to the souls but also to the bodies, and presupposes the characteristic of exclusiveness that is typical of the love of a thing. But it is also the love of a person and implies by its nature a constancy or endurance until death.",

It was revealed that the main components of the texts of health and illness (often typologically corresponding to the texts of life and death) in the Pechora dialects are the following motifs: the presence / absence of a power or impatient condition; compliance / non-compliance of a man to his functional nature; ending with / continuing movement along a predetermined path, the road descent / return to the road, loss / finding of yourself.

The way a social system performs these functions will affect power relations and condition the behaviors of its human components, but it is also true that people — both as individuals and through their organizations — affect their encompassing social, economic, and political environments. In responding to events and maintaining themselves, people alter their surroundings in ways that then push their lives in directions that often were not anticipated.

He chooses his words carefully. With obvious reluctance, he says that it is possible that this man has been cheating him. He is silent for a moment, then he says quietly that he thinks he has known this in a way for a long time. Finally, he adds, But you don't know it until you say it out loud. Thus we learn that there are two kinds of knowing: knowing in a way and really knowing. Furthermore, the transition from one to the other occurs upon saying it out loud. The difference, other words, is not a matter of acquiring additional information, but of conscious articulation of what was already some sense known but not articulated. One might call it a process of consciousness raising. The earlier state was one which the speaker did not know (and did not want to know) what he knew; the final state was one which he realized what he knew, admitting it to his listener and to himself at the same stroke. It appears, therefore, that there is a distinction between what one feels or believes about something and what one imagines oneself to feel or believe.' A disjunction between these two is wbat we call self-deception.",

I use the term “microdialogue,” rather than the more familiar notion of “internal conversation” or “society of mind,” to refer to a silent and invisible series of dialogues we hold for ourselves with the images and voices of others, which can emerge in surprising and unwilled ways. I suggest that this micro-dialogue is important in understanding the dialogical interactions between persons, as not all aspects of the self will enter into dialogue with others, leading to miscommunication, misunderstanding, and misrecognition. It is also possible for people to fail to articulate all the latent voices or vocal tones in their own micro-dialogue, leading to an understanding of how voices and selves can become divided and allowing us to take a different perspective on a dialogical unconscious.",

Two case studies are presented: one of Lorretta, who, because of emotionally and physically absent parents, has no sense of entitlement or of self. She can't image what she looks like and is completely puzzled as to how people think or manage their lives. The second case is of Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, poet, social critic, and hermit. Greatly admired by his parents, he felt from earliest childhood that he was special, with a special destiny awaiting him. His life of silence and poverty presents a special kind of selflessness: a loss of self that is freely chosen in order to more deeply experience himself and God. Healthy and unhealthy understandings of Christianity are examined as aspects of selflessness.",

Abstract: Since the beginning of humanity, the man has been exposed to many factors that put in risk the health, and, in consequence, perceptible scars are left in our bodies by some illness or an accidental event. These scars are reflected in the lack of somebody members, a deformity, or even the absence of mental processes, disrupting the autonomy of these individuals to do their daily activities. The people are scared about the differences, because historically they have misconceptions about the disabilities, ideas commonly spread by the predominant social system. The social State, subject to the rule of law makes an imposition in the way we talk, think, and attend the disability and the disabled people, surpassing the ancient conceptions of Greece about their value or importance in the world.

      "abstract": "Abstract The striving for and experience of freedom are of central importance in human life. Our concern here is not freedom as a characteristic of a social (political) system or as a social value, but the experience of external and internal freedom in the natural surroundings of everyday life. There are situations that offer little restraint, in terms of both physical obstacles and social pressures. In such a situation a person experiences external freedom: If one wanted to, one could leave the situation or do something different within the situation without an effort to overcome physical obstacles and/or without being blamed (punished) by social agents. Thus, the concept of external freedom implies both being able and being allowed to do what one wants to do. There are, on the other hand, situations or activities that one can leave or change without acting against one’s personal norms, and feeling guilty. In this case we speak of internal freedom. In this sense, a person, even if experiencing an irresistible impulse to act in a certain way, is internally free to act if the desire is fully compatible with his or her values, that is, if he or she does not have to overcome anticipated feelings of guilt.",

These features are thoroughly examined in terms of composition, decomposition, causation and co-occurrence with functional words. This leads to the conclusion that a construction to be called a RVC must be subject to the following constraints: it must be composed of two components: verb and complement, the former indicating the causing action or event, and the latter the resulting state or event; there is no distance between the verb and the complement, and no insertion is allowed; it must be able to undergo semantic decomposition, and the relation between the two decomposed readings must be causative, with the first the causing event and the second the caused event; and it must be able to co-occur with the aspect le, indicating the finish of an action, otherwise, it must be connected with such functional words as jiang, yao and hui, indicating possibilities or future events, but it must not co-occur with zheng, indicating continuity and process of an action.",

      "abstract": "People are fundamentally social beings and enjoy connecting with others, sometimes reaching out to others—whether simply to say hello and to check in on how others are doing with a brief message, or to send a small gift to show that one is thinking of the other person. Yet despite the importance and enjoyment of social connection, do people accurately understand how much other people value being reached out to by someone in their social circle? Across a series of pre-registered experiments, we document a robust underestimation of how much other people appreciate being reached out to. We find evidence compatible with an account wherein one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is because responders (vs. initiators) are more focused on their feelings of surprise at being reached out to; such a focus on feelings of surprise in turn predicts greater appreciation. We further identify process-consistent moderators of the underestimation of reach-out appreciation, finding that it is magnified when the reach-out context is more surprising: when it occurs within a surprising (vs. unsurprising) context for the recipient and when it occurs between more socially distant (vs. socially close) others. Altogether, this research thus identifies when and why we underestimate how much other people appreciate us reaching out to them, implicating a heightened focus on feelings of surprise as one underlying explanation.",

      "abstract": "The present study is a part of a long term (re)search focalized on a triad of concepts: {Knowledge Society, Consciousness Society, Learn to Live ‘Together’}. Each of the concepts of this triad has a specific autonomy and evolution – each of the concepts of this triad toward the other two concepts has mostly initial comprehended relations. But the extended-triadic relation or maybe relations is indebted or are indebted to a necessary to be revealed understanding mostly than to a current explanation. Into this future possible stance of realizing [or not] the hypothetically structural and functional essences of this triad of concepts could be acted by ‘complex cognitive objects’ and/or ‘creative-subjective inquiries’. These objects and inquiries maybe would contain and/or consist by limits, paradoxes and constrains. These objects and inquiries maybe would frame probabilistic, fuzzy or subtle statements. So, the foreseen - the foresight - and then the forecasting on the above introduced triad of concepts could be, again, necessary cognitive and praxis zones/directions of ‘revealed understanding mostly than current explanations’. All these could delimitate a long term (re)search.The present study as a PART of the above considered long term (re)search is focalized on the triad of concepts: {Knowledge Society, Consciousness Society, Learn to Live ‘Together’} - but is intended to ‘recursively’ and only ‘in PART’ to contribute by eliciting a ‘revealed understanding mostly than current explanations’. This intended contribution could stand ‘here and now’ by an enactment of aggregation of high science-technology contemporary topics (and other related topics) ‘towards, alongside and within’ a medium to a large scale two parts topic (‘recursively’ and ‘in PART’) re-entitled as:Does Collective versus Social (Societal) Intelligence Matter within Our (e-)World?LEARN TO LIVE ‘TOGETHER’ The paragraphs [A -:- H] and the three annexes are step by step tending to extend as much as possible the knowledge-borders related to the two parts of this just above re-entitlement of this present study: Does Collective versus Social (Societal) Intelligence Matter? It is an inquiring construct – focusing on the inner (internal state) objective of this study, as an intra-open stage of research and next praxis.LEARN TO LIVE ‘TOGETHER’ is a volitional construct. This study also stands as a pre-enactment to prove that this volitional construct is carried up by a collective AND social (societal) subject (actor, agent / multi-agent, ‘to do’ respondent). Let simple rename it as ‘Rational Subject’ within the context and the innovative matter of research and next praxis. And so, the ‘link’ between the two parts of this (initial) title of this study is here the ‘corner-stone’ and the implicitly emergent objective of research.Also, these [inquiring and respective volitional] constructs would elicit, will make possible to construct and consequently will make possible to act [by the Rational Subject] on the utility and upon the possibility of a NETWORK OF NETWORKS – a network of a ‘part’ of the worldwide existing networks, and of a ‘part’ of a medium term-next networks [considering the implicitly emergent objective of research as respondent of the respective actual and next ‘parts’ to be on role].",

      "abstract": "Human speech is frequently accompanied by movements of the arms and hands termed gestures. The majority of these gestures is invented spontaneously and is highly iconic but some gestures are used functionally in ways very similar to speech that is symbolically, referentially, based on intersubjectively learned and shared social conventions. Our closest living relatives, the great apes also use gestures in their natural communication in a variety of contexts such as play, grooming, sex and agonistic encounters. A deep understanding of apes’ gestural signalling might therefore be helpful to get insight into the evolutionary scenario of human communication and cognition. The present chapter investigates the nature of the gestural signalling of the four great apes, bonobos (Pan paniscus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), with a special focus on the following three aspects: (1) the intentionality of gestures, (2) their referential use, and (3) similarities and differences to gestures in prelinguistic or just-linguistic human infants.",

      "title": "Expansive Posture",
      "abstract": "Much can be gleaned about the affective, cognitive, and motivational states of others by attending to various channels of nonverbal communication. Although there are a variety of ways to organize the body of research on the psychological correlates of nonverbal behavior, researchers in social psychology and communication often distinguish between two dimensions: the hierarchical dimension (status/dominance/power) and the affiliative dimension (liking/romantic interest). Most nonverbal cues have implications for both of these dimensions, and postural expansion is not an exception. Postural expansion includes “enlarging” behaviors such as sitting more erectly, opening up the torso, and extending limbs away from the body. In contrast, postural constriction involves postures that ultimately make an organism appear smaller (such as slumping the shoulders, wrapping limbs around the body, or averting the gaze downward). Numerous researchers have noted the comparative similarity between postural expansion and constriction in humans and, respectively, dominance and submission displays in animals. For example, the bristling of a cat’s fur (piloerection) in response to threat serves to make the animal look larger and more threatening, while the exposure of a dog’s stomach in submission or appeasement serves to make the animal appear smaller, less threatening, or more vulnerable. Substantially more literature has investigated the association between postural expansion and the hierarchical dimension than the affiliative dimension, a bias that is duplicated here. Furthermore, it is important to note that the “hierarchical” literature addresses several related, but unique, questions: (1) How does postural expansion affect perceptions of others’ status/dominance/power? (2) Is postural expansion linked with actual differences in status/dominance/power or other relevant dependent measures? (3) Is postural expansion reliably linked with an important universal nonverbal expression?",

      "title": "The meaning of representation in animal memory",
      "abstract": "Abstract A representation is a remnant of previous experience that allows that experience to affect later behavior. This paper develops a metatheoretical view of representation and applies it to issues concerning representation in animals. To describe a representational system one must specify the following: the domain or range of situations in the represented world to which the system applies; the content or set of features encoded and preserved by the system; the code or transformational rules relating features of the representation to the corresponding features of the represented world; the medium , or the representation's physical instantiation; and the dynamics , or how the system changes with time. In part because of the behaviorist assumption that the hypothetical, covert changes occurring in an organism during learning correspond to the overt physical changes that are observed, issues of representation in animal behavior have been largely ignored as irrelevant or misleading. However, it can be inferred that representations, acting as models of environmental regularities, operate at many levels of behavioral functioning, both cognitive and noncognitive. Objections to the use of this concept in explanations of animal behavior, based on the claim that it is indeterminate and on behaviorist considerations of parsimony, can be answered. Animal representations may be specialized in terms of tasks and species. Data from tasks involving spatial memory, delayed matching-to-sample, and sequence learning suggest some foundations for a general theory of animal representations.",

      "title": "EVENT: SOME COMMENTS ON ITS POLITICAL IMPLICATION",
      "abstract": "An Event is an Encounter in human life.Social Science, according to what Edgar Morin says in his pioneering article on the Sociology of Event (“Evénement-Sphinx, ” in Communication, No. 18), has been oppressed by obsolete schemes for it relies on only two items of analysis: static Structure and dynamic History. With these archaic schemes, social science is no longer able to analyze the complexities of present-day society. To re-vitalize social science, two mediate items, System and Event, should be added.System is self-regulating, controlled by information-apparatus or culture, existing as it does within a larger Eco-system or Environment.Interactions between System and Eco-system are potential Events. So, Event may be considered the response to challenge, in Toynbee's terms. Responses can be of three types: 1) System is so closed that it shuts out any challenge, or if a challenge filters in, the System is unresponsive. In this case, System is stagnant. 2) If the response proves to be unsuccessful, System is destroyed. 3) Lastly, if System succeeds in achieving a creative response, Learning, Evolution and Development can result. In short, durable change or transformation is brought to the System.Another French theorist, Louis Althusser (“Pour Marx”) writes that the creative response, which can be achieved only by exploring our “collective unconsciousness of depth, ” enables us to solve the problem of “realizing the necessariness of History in our accidentalness.” Here the creative response can be construed as the significant Event in politics, and so we may, to present a hypothesis, apply this idea in exploring the implications of Japanese political tradition.What is the “collective unconsciousness of depth” of Japanese people? Shuzo Kuki, a philosopher who analyzed the implications of Japanese culture in “Ori-ni-Fure-te (Accidental Sayings), ” feels that the essence of Event is an Accidental Encounter between two things and/or persons that gives birth to something new. The Chinese characters are shown because they have the same pronunciation and associated meaning.Furthermore, in our own language, politics is literally called the Festival-Event (matsurigoto). According to sociologist, Kazuko Tsurumi, who explores the modernizing capacities of Kunio Yanagita's study of Japanese folklore in her “Hyohaku-to-Teiju-to (Vagrancy and Settlement), ” the festival (matsuri) is an Encounter between the settled people and the vagrants. This Event has a vitalizing effect on an otherwise static social life.In Japan, one of the most conspicuous recent phenomena is the increased population of Danchi, collective housing areas. Here the temporary inhabitants of Danchi once again embody the idea of an Encounter between the settled and the vagrant, as seen in the Matsuri concept above. Again, this form of temporary residence is expressed with the Chinese character, which has the same pronunciation as and.Moreover, these Danchi residents are assuming a large part of the responsibility for the “citizens” or “tenants” campaigns in Japanese politics. These campaigns are sowing seeds which could grow to have a long-range effect on maintaining and improving the quality of human life in post-industrial Japan.If this hypothesis or expectation is justified, the Encounter embodied by the political role of Danchi residents could result in the most significant Event in human history.",

I believe that great achievements in acting are beyond the split between emotion and idea, or the illusory antagonism of conscious and unconscious, intelligence and sensitivity.",

      "title": "To Know Them, Remove Them: an Outer Methodological Approach to Biophysics and Humanities",
      "abstract": "Set theory faces two difficulties: formal definitions of sets/subsets are incapable of assessing biophysical issues; formal axiomatic systems are complete/inconsistent or incomplete/consistent. To overtake these problems reminiscent of the old-fashioned principle of individuation, we provide formal treatment/validation/operationalization of a methodological weapon termed “outer approach” (OA). The observer’s attention shifts from the system under evaluation to its surroundings, so that objects are investigated from outside. Subsets become just “holes” devoid of information inside larger sets. Sets are no longer passive containers, rather active structures enabling their content’s examination. Consequences/applications of OA include: a) operationalization of paraconsistent logics, anticipated by unexpected forerunners, in terms of advanced truth theories of natural language, anthropic principle and quantum dynamics; b) assessment of embryonic craniocaudal migration in terms of Turing’s spots; c) evaluation of hominids’ social behaviors in terms of evolutionary modifications of facial expression’s musculature; d) treatment of cortical action potentials in terms of collective movements of extracellular currents, leaving apart what happens inside the neurons; e) a critique of Shannon’s information in terms of the Arabic thinkers’ active/potential intellects. Also, OA provides an outer view of a) humanistic issues such as the enigmatic Celestino of Verona’s letter, Dante Alighieri’s “Hell” and the puzzling Voynich manuscript; b) historical issues such as Aldo Moro’s death and the Liston/Clay boxing fight. Summarizing, the safest methodology to quantify phenomena is to remove them from our observation and tackle an outer view, since mathematical/logical issues such as selective information deletion and set complement rescue incompleteness/inconsistency of biophysical systems.",

      "abstract": "Individual differences in pro-environmentalism (connectedness to nature, pro-environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior) have been attributed to various personality traits and, most recently, socially/ethically aversive (aka ‘dark’) traits in particular. However, the empirical picture linking such traits to pro-environmentalism is scattered and has produced contradictory findings. We propose a more parsimonious and consistent explanation of individual differences in pro-environmentalism through the D factor, the common core of all aversive traits. Across 12 studies (total N = 13,882) we show substantial and consistent negative correlations (−0.56 ≤ r ≤ −0.26) between D and connectedness to nature, pro-environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. Moreover, the ‘dark tetrad’ traits (Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy, and Sadism), alone or in their common combinations (as a triad or tetrad), never explained more total variance in either of these criteria than D alone. Finally, the extent to which any dark tetrad trait was negatively associated with pro-environmentalism was entirely due to D. These findings bear implications for the broader nature of pro-environmentalism and theoretical parsimony in research on individual differences in pro-environmentalism.",

It may be an individual or a group, an obvious misfit or a concealed one, a temporary phenomenon or a permanent lifestyle (adopted willingly or unwillingly). The scapegoat makes it possible for man to live at peace with God, himself or his society by acting as symbolic recipient of qualities which man is unwilling to recognise in himself. The scapegoater by his treatment tries to reduce the scapegoat into something not human; for this reason a scapegoat which shows only small divergences from the norm evokes particular hostility. The individual scapegoat in a small group may accept his role fairly happily, but group scapegoats find few compensations. A variety of defence mechanisms will be adopted in these circumstances, but generally mature adjustment is impossible. The scientific and artistic achievements of scapegoats in the past have helped to liberalise society and extend the range of our compassion. So perhaps a society without scapegoats would lose its capacity for moral growth.",

      "title": "Secure Trust-based Cooperative Communications in Wireless Multi-Hop Networks",
      "abstract": "The word cooperate derives from the Latin words co-and operate (to work), thus it connotes the idea of “working together”. Cooperation is the strategy of a group of entities working together to achieve a common or individual goal. The main idea behind cooperation is that each cooperating entity gains by means of the uniﬁed activity. Cooperation can be seen as the action of obtaining some advantage by giving, sharing or allowing something. Cooperation is extensively applied by human beings and animals, and we would like here to map different cooperation strategies into wireless communication systems. While the term cooperation can be used to describe any relationship where all participants contribute, we tend to use it here to describe the more restrictive case in which all participants gain. If we use it in the broader sense of simply working together, it will be apparent from the context or explicitly stated. This restricted deﬁnition of cooperation contrasts with altruism, a behaviour where one of the participants does not gain from the interaction to support others (Frank & Marcos, 2006). Cooperation has become an academic subject of intensive study in the social and biological sciences, as well as in mathematics and artificial intelligence. The most fundamental finding is that even egoists can support cooperation if necessary. In the field of information systems, some notable illustrations of this principle have recently emerged. One example is the success of open source in which thousands of people have cooperatively created a system, such as Linux. Another example is the success of eBay, which is based on a feedback system by verifying the accumulated reputations through cooperating with others in the past, making strangers mutually trust. Recently, Wireless multi-hop networks provide yet another realm in which cooperation among large numbers of egoists can be attained, provided that the right institutional structure can designed and implemented. Wireless communications is a rapidly emerging area of technology. Its success will depend in large measure on whether self-interested individuals can be provided a structure in which they are proper incentives to act in a cooperative mode. Cooperative techniques can be employed across different layers of a communication system and across different communication networks. The foremost premise of cooperative techniques is through cooperation, all participants engaged in cooperative communication may obtain some benefits.",

The most significant component of the impact of postoperative disfigurement and dysfunction appears within a social context where the drastic alteration in anatomic contour interrupts the visual impression ordinarily provided by the face in social interation. Physological, psychological, and social adaptation to postsurgical defects can indeed be facilitated with proper intervention. The deepest and initial suffering is often silent and unarticulated. The tendency toward silence appeared to have been reinforced by emotionally traumatic expierences in early life. . In the existential dimension of suffering, one is searching for one's own of giving the suffering meaning and the fight for hope and life. The struggling act of suffering demads a compassonate other to confirm suffering.",

      "title": "Language, gesture and meaning",
      "abstract": "We speak; we gesture. A variety of gestures occur naturally when people talk to each other. First, self-adaptors are self-touching movements which can be meaningful in interaction. For instance, a simple touch of the nose could mean that someone was not being truthful. Such movements do not bear a direct semantic relationship with the utterance. Emblematic gestures, on the other hand, are meaningful in their own right. They have socially agreed-upon standards of well-formedness and are produced in much the same way across the users of a particular language, like waving the hand for 'goodbye' or making the okay gesture for 'approval'. The emblematic meaning may or may not be associated with speech (Ekman and Friesen, 1969; Goldin-Meadow, 1999; Kendon, 1984, 1995, 2004; McNeill, 1992, 2005). Beat gestures, however, are bound to utterance. They are typically small up and down or back and forth flicks of one or both hands that occur along with the rhythm of speech (McNeill, 1992; McClave, 1994). Beat gestures have no semantic association with speech, but can be used to emphasize portions of the speech content (Efron, 1941, 1972; Wagner et al., 2014). McNeill (1992: 15) found that in narrative discourse, \"the occurrence of beats is related to discourse structure, when there are shifts among the narrative, metanarrative, and paranarrative levels of discourse\". Next, deictic gestures have to do with pointing to linguistic referents in the immediate speech environment. Spatial gestures are used to allocate gesture spaces symbolically to the linguistic referents. Finally, iconic gestures bear a direct semantic relationship with speech (McNeill, 1992, 2000). The meaning conveyed by iconic gestures mainly rests upon context. Consider Figure 16.1. The speaker on the left, who first had the arms crossed under the chest, moved the hands to the front; then, the hands in lightly formed fists, the left one slightly above the right, moved in a curve from the center to her right periphery. It is difficult to comprehend what such gesture means in the interaction without the presence of speech, despite the fact that the hand movements are conspicuous, noticeable, and produced in the center space (see the Gesture Space in McNeill, 1992).",

for we have seen that the most perfect memory a memory probably more perfect, and certainly more minute, than that of any person of superior intelligence can exist with very little judg-i ment, or with none at all.Is it the novelty then tNo ; not altogether, and probably not at all ; for in that case, we would surely best remember the great- est novelty ; and that unquestionably is the first sight we get of the world.The reason why we remember cannot be explained by the individual things that we remember ; and as little can it be owing to any act of the mind, con- sidered as such.Where then shall we seek for it ?We shall best answer that question by putting another, and pausing to weigh it well before we answer it.How came we by all that we think and know, or by all that we can think *?The answer to that question, if the right one, will show us where the mine of knowledge is, and how that mine can be worked ; and if we know these, no matter how small our present stock of knowledge may be, we shall soon and easily obtain more as much more as we please.That is a very simple question, a question the answer to which requires no philosophy, no learn- ing, no reading, nay not even the faculty of speech ; and yet that question is the seal upon all the possi- ble knowledge of which we are not in possession ; and many of us live long and go down to our graves in ignorance merely because we do not see, orj seeing, will not take the trouble to break that seal.That truth is so very important that we must dwell MERE SENSATION.the purely mental act of perceiving relation, and the mind's act through the senses in perceiving reality ; and for that reason we generally use only half our system work with half our strength.Not half of it even no, not a tenth ; for the real power is in the union of the two.When we use our senses, we do not think; and so the object of those senses can be turned to no profit, and give us no pleasure.If we do not think at the same time, the appearances of objects have no more effect upon our organs of sense than sun- beams when they play on the snow-clad summit of a lofty mountain ; they are reflected away in an in- stant ; and that which would have warmed a more genial place into life and beauty is gone wasted, never to return.How, scorpion-like, a little bit of the tail of some day spent in favourable places, but spent thoughtlessly, will turn and sting us with the remorse of how much we have lost, and lost never to be recalled or replaced !How often, even when the most delightfully instructive prospects are before us, have we reason to address ourselves in the words of Macbeth to the ghost of his murdered friend : \" Thou hast no speculation in these eyes Which thou dost glare with.\"And we, too, are murderers, and murderers \"red hand\" in the fact, and not in the remorse caused by the dogging ghost of that which we are murdering.We are murdering Time the means of all know- ledge, and the measure of all enjoying ; and, inde- pendently of the direct loss, which is irreparable, if the ghost of murdered Time shall, at any period, rise and haunt us, it is one of the most terrible of ghosts, and we must abide its tormentings alone and unpitied.This abuse of our time, and neglect of thinking, instead of working its own cure, throws us into the opposite fault; and, just because we have gazed without thinking, we think without observing, andJose both the time and the thought ; and lose it in 'nature.If we loiter on the sleepless pillow, and have not resolution enough to get up, then our torment lasts till the dawn has so far advanced as that we can see distinctly, or till the beams of the early sun are breaking in through the chink of the shutters, or the opening of the curtains ; but soon after even the articles of the room are revealed to our observation, our minds are tranquillized, and we glide into dozing slumber.",

Evolved behavior, including that of other animals, is not entirely devoid of normativity, however. Defining normativity as adherence to an ideal or standard, there is ample evidence that animals treat their social relationships in this manner. In other words, they pursue social values. Here I review evidence that nonhuman primates actively try to preserve harmony within their social network by, e.g., reconciling after conflict, protesting against unequal divisions, and breaking up fights amongst others. In doing so, they correct deviations from an ideal state. They further show emotional self-control and anticipatory conflict resolution in order to prevent such deviations. Recognition of the goal-orientation and normative character of animal social behavior permits us to partially bridge the is/ought divide erected in relation to human moral behavior.",

Since 100s of years man has been characterized as melancholic or choleric, representing a bad or good bile flow, respectively (18). We also talk about the well being after a good dinner including the use of aphrodisiacs to wake up emotions of love. It is very probable that all these old expressions can be related to sensations, which are primitive and possibly already generated in our mind in infancy, when we were fed by our mothers in close relationship with a life almost exclusively consisting of feeding, close warmness of our mother's body, the wordless dialogue to her and sleep (12, 13, 25, 30).It is said that it is impossible for the infant to separate the feelings from bodysensations and obviously cannot express the feelings verbally. It is thus not surprising that early psychological stress results in feeding and sleeping disturbances (10, 23). It is also natural that symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract might be dominating during depression or stress-situations during the early age period of life as well as later on (8, 9).",

In these the patient is said to be acting out his hostilities or maladjustments or to be making a social protest to express his contempt for his society or his world, or to be making a good attempt to destroy himself with alcohol.

      "title": "Using metaphor in healthcare: physical health",
      "abstract": "As shown throughout this volume, metaphors are regularly used to talk and think about experiences that are subjective, complex and sensitive in terms of experiences that are less subjective, simpler and more concrete. Health and illness, and the emotions associated with them, are among the experiences that we often talk about through metaphors. As is the case more generally, these metaphors tend to rely on perceived similarities between different kinds of experiences. For example, the metaphorical use of ‘battle’ in ‘she died after a long battle with cancer’ relies on the perception of a similarity between being ill with cancer and fighting in a war: both experiences are difficult and potentially life-threatening, both require perseverance, and so on. However, as our use of the term ‘perceived’ similarity suggests, metaphors do not reflect objectively given similarities, but can create similarities between unlike things: they can reflect, convey and reinforce different ways of seeing and experiencing different aspects of our lives. In the terms used in Conceptual Metaphor Theory (see Chapter 1), the choice of different source domains ‘frames’ the target domain in different ways, highlighting some aspects and backgrounding others (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Ritchie 2013).",

We use body language without being aware of it, perceive and interpret other people's body language. Three classes of nonverbal behavior are the verbal-vocal, nonverbal-vocal, and nonverbal-nonvocal.

Nonverbal phenomena are most important in the structuring and occurrence of interpersonal communication and the movement-to-movement regulation of the interaction. Nonverbal signs help regulate the system, cueing hierarchy and priority among communicators, signaling the flow of interaction, and providing meta-communication and feedback.

      "title": "Do guide dogs have culture? The case of indirect social learning",
      "abstract": "Abstract In the study of animal behaviour, culture is often seen as the result of direct social transmission from a model to a conspecific. In this essay, we show that unrecognised cultural phenomena are sustained by a special form of indirect social learning (ISL). ISL occurs when an individual B learns a behaviour from an individual A through something produced by A. A’s behavioural products can be chemicals, artefacts, but also, we argue, behaviours of another group or species that are the consequence of A’s actions. For instance, a behaviour—guiding a blind person—can be transmitted from dog A to dog B, because the fact that dog A learns the behaviour creates in the mind of the trainer representations about the efficacy of the training practice that can be transmitted to another human, who can then train dog B. These dog behaviours have all the properties of standard cultural behaviours and spread in some dog populations through the exploitation of the social learning capacities of another group/species. Following this idea requires a change in perspective on how we see the social transmission of behaviours and brings forward the fact that certain cultural practices can spread among animals through a cultural co-evolutionary dynamic with humans or other animals.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of altruism and reciprocity has been explained mainly from ultimate perspectives. However, in order to understand from a proximate perspective how humans evolved to be such cooperative animals, comparative studies with our evolutionary relatives are essential. Here we review several recent experimental studies on chimpanzees’ altruism and reciprocity. These studies have generated some conflicting results. By examining the differences in the results and experimental paradigms, two characteristics of prosociality in chimpanzees emerged: (1) chimpanzees are more likely to behave altruistically and/or reciprocally upon a recipient’s request, than without request, and (2) chimpanzees also show a tendency to regard others and help in contexts not involving food. Supposing that these two characteristics of altruism, recipient-initiated altruism and non-food altruism, were present in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, it is possible that increased social cognitive abilities, capacity for language, necessity for food sharing, and enriched material culture favored in humans the unique evolution of cooperation, characterized by voluntary altruism and frequent food donation.",

      "title": "Brand ﬂ ings: when great brand relationships are not made to last",
      "abstract": "It may be a Hollywood cliché, but it is nonetheless true – relationships are complicated. Because of this complexity, relationships are generally not unidimensional constructs. What is more, relationships have many moving parts, and it is the way these parts fit together which often defines the relationship type. For example, if when a person arrives you feel happy and when they leave you feel sad, this relationship is typical of friendship. But if when a person arrives you feel sad and when he or she leaves you feel happy, that relationship is more typical of an enemy. Both relationships contain the same parts: someone comes, someone goes, you feel happy, or you feel sad. But these parts fit together differently in each case, and hence the relationships they typify are also quite different. I argue here that relationship types (e.g. friendship, love, enmity) are fairly complex systems whose parts typically include behaviors, emotions, thoughts, social norms, etc. Furthermore, the relationship type is defined not just by what its components are, but by the ways these components interact with each other. I suspect that for many readers, nothing said so far has been terribly controversial. Yet it has been my experience that if one tries to apply this thinking in one's research, it raises construct validity issues which have not been well explored the past literature. And these unresolved construct validity issues make it difficult to publish research in its most useful and insightful forms. My goal, then, is to begin addressing these issues in the hope that doing so will allow consumer–brand relationship researchers to publish the most theoretically appropriate models for their constructs.",

A further difference between the two groups of emotion verbs is that only verbs that indicate negative feelings are used in the imperative and co-occur with cause expressions. We argue that the extension of either construction to verbs of emotion accounts for different construals: while situations of anger, hate and envy are construed as interactive, with an agent that initiates an event and a second participant that may react, love and desire are construed as uncontrolled and not interactive.",

The provoking behavior was generally portrayed by the perpetrator as meaningful and comprehensible, whereas the victim tended to depict it as arbitrary, gratuitous, or incomprehensible. Victim accounts portrayed the incident in a long-term context that carried lasting implications, especially of continuing harm, loss, and grievance. Perpetrator accounts tended to cast the incident as a closed, isolated incident that did not have lasting implications. Several findings fit a hypothesis that interpersonal conflicts may arise when a victim initially stifles anger and then finally responds to an accumulated series of provocations, whereas the perpetrator perceives only the single incident and regards the angry response as an unjustified overreaction. Victim and perpetrator roles are associated with different subjective interpretations.",

Speech has also another root of a social nature. The psychic contact with other human beings, which already begins in the first weeks of infancy and which the child tries to strengthen by primitive means, leads to an interchange of vocal utterances forming a preparation for later speech as well as for an understanding of what is said. The child approaches speech along three paths: the active expression of childish babble, unintelligent imitations and understanding what is said to it. There are many children whose exceptional idleness in talking need cause no anxiety, since they give abundant proof of understanding what they hear. From the numberless words which the child continually hears, his mind makes an unconscious selection by discarding most and only retaining a few.",

      "title": "The integration of paralinguistic information from the face and the voice",
      "abstract": "We live in a world which bombards us with a huge amount of sensory information, even if we are not always aware of it. To successfully navigate, function and ultimately survive in our environment we use all of the cues available to us. Furthermore, we actually combine this information: doing so allows us not only to construct a richer percept of the objects around us, but actually increases the reliability of our decisions and sensory estimates. However, at odds with our naturally multisensory awareness of our surroundings, the literature addressing unisensory processes has always far exceeded that which examines the multimodal nature of perception.\r\n\r\nArguably the most salient and relevant stimuli in our environment are other people. Our species is not designed to operate alone, and so we have evolved to be especially skilled in all those things which enable effective social interaction – this could be engaging in conversation, but equally as well recognising a family member, or understanding the current emotional state of a friend, and adjusting our behaviour appropriately. In particular, the face and the voice both provide us with a wealth of hugely relevant social information - linguistic, but also non-linguistic. In line with work conducted in other fields of multisensory perception, research on face and voice perception has mainly concentrated on each of these modalities independently, particularly face perception. Furthermore, the work that has addressed integration of these two sources by and large has concentrated on the audiovisual nature of speech perception.\r\n\r\nThe work in this thesis is based on a theoretical model of voice perception which not only proposed a serial processing pathway of vocal information, but also emphasised the similarities between face and voice processing, suggesting that this information may interact. Significantly, these interactions were not just confined to speech processing, but rather encompassed all forms of information processing, whether this was linguistic or paralinguistic. Therefore, in this thesis, I concentrate on the interactions between, and integration of face-voice paralinguistic information.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 3 we conducted a general investigation of neural face-voice integration. A number of studies have attempted to identify the cerebral regions in which information from the face and voice combines; however, in addition to a large number of regions being proposed as integration sites, it is not known whether these regions are selective in the binding of these socially relevant stimuli. We identified firstly regions in the bilateral superior temporal sulcus (STS) which showed an increased response to person-related information – whether this was faces, voices, or faces and voices combined – in comparison to information from objects. A subsection of this region in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) also produced a significantly stronger response to audiovisual as compared to unimodal information. We therefore propose this as a potential people-selective, integrative region. Furthermore, a large portion of the right pSTS was also observed to be people-selective and heteromodal: that is, both auditory and visual information provoked a significant response above baseline. These results underline the importance of the STS region in social communication.\r\n\r\nChapter 4 moved on to study the audiovisual perception of gender. Using a set of novel stimuli – which were not only dynamic but also morphed in both modalities – we investigated whether different combinations of gender information in the face and voice could affect participants’ perception of gender. We found that participants indeed combined both sources of information when categorising gender, with their decision being reflective of information contained in both modalities. However, this combination was not entirely equal: in this experiment, gender information from the voice appeared to dominate over that from the face, exerting a stronger modulating effect on categorisation. This result was supported by the findings from conditions which directed to attention, where we observed participants were able to ignore face but not voice information; and also reaction times results, where latencies were generally a reflection of voice morph. Overall, these results support interactions between face and voice in gender perception, but demonstrate that (due to a number of probable factors) one modality can exert more influence than another.\r\n\r\nFinally, in Chapter 5 we investigated the proposed interactions between affective content in the face and voice. Specifically, we used a ‘continuous carry-over’ design – again in conjunction with dynamic, morphed stimuli – which allowed us to investigate not only ‘direct’ effects of different sets of audiovisual stimuli (e.g., congruent, incongruent), but also adaptation effects (in particular, the effect of emotion expressed in one modality upon the response to emotion expressed in another modality). Parallel to behavioural results, which showed that the crossmodal context affected the time taken to categorise emotion, we observed a significant crossmodal effect in the right pSTS, which was independent of any within-modality adaptation. We propose that this result provides strong evidence that this region may be composed of similarly multisensory neurons, as opposed to two sets of interdigitised neurons responsive to information from one modality or the other. Furthermore, an analysis investigating stimulus congruence showed that the degree of incongruence modulated activity across the right STS, further inferring neural response in this region can be altered depending on the particular combination of affective information contained within the face and voice. Overall, both behavioural and cerebral results from this study suggested that participants integrated emotion from the face and voice.",

      "title": "Living through trauma: to bear the unbearable, to speak the unspeakable",
      "abstract": "A traumatic situation can be both cataclysmic and disorganising, while putting the whole existence of the individual to the test. Every trauma causes either minor or major rifts in the psyche, thus putting a strain on the patient’s present, past and future. Specifically, when the traumatic experience remains without adequate mentalization, in an instinctive form, it can severely affect the patient, both psychologically and socially. In this paper, we discuss the dual dimension of the traumatic experience. Firstly, since the psyche cannot elaborate the traumatic event or situation psychologically, only minor symbolic or mental representations are available, and the traumatic content cannot find its place in the patient’s psychic history. Since the trauma cannot be worked through psychologically, it usually comprises a massive experience of deadly anxieties, mixed with somatic and sensorial memories. Secondly, the consequences of the trauma have a social dimension. Individuals may feel disconnected and disengaged from their social existence and identity, alone and unprotected, as trauma can lead to them questioning their social identity. The unearthing of the previous psychic traumas explains why the therapy of traumatised patients demands in-depth, individual therapeutic work. Trauma therefore attacks in a dual manner, setting out to test all the aspects of the individual’s functioning. The therapeutic challenges for working with traumatised children and adolescents are considerable, as the clinical vignettes illustrate.",

Yet, it is not always clear what natural behavior is, nor whether maximal humanlikeness equals optimal user satisfaction. 3) Multidisciplinary design teams require transdisciplinary theory to create mutual understanding and cover the wide-ranging facets of robot design. However, combining diverse theories from different domains means confronting major unification problems. 4) Empirical approaches to robot design usually miss out on logic consistency within theory. Conversely, formalization and mathematical modeling often lack external validity. Verification before validation seems to be the new way to go. 5) Finally, if it is actually possible to create lifelike, affective, sociable androids, the cognitive models underlying their behavior may be open to abuse, for example in malicious software that spies on people.",

It demonstrates the epistemological inferiority, even uselessness, of the psychologists' approach. Anxiety and fear belong to so-called general feelings (<i>Gemeingefühle</i>). Fear is an atavistic emotional heritage serving protective purposes against a threatening event, impending danger, or risky performance. This psychological emotion is a cortical function with repercussion on the diencephalic autonomic nervous system. Alteration of respiration, pulse rate, or blood pressure; blushing or pallor; inhibition of salivary secretion; or weeping are witness thereof. Anxiety is fear without extrinsic cause, without a substratum, not fear of something. It is an autonomous feeling aroused by intrinsic cortical processes, conscious or subconscious memories and associations originating from past experiences and life situations. It is a pathological outlet of mental processes involved",

      "title": "External possession and constructions that may have it",
      "abstract": "Abstract There seems to be no construction that would code specifically the possession relation of external possessors. Instead, various host constructions such as the free-affectee construction (a subtype of which is the free-dative construction), monotransitive or applicative construction can – to a different degree – accommodate participants that are bound by a possession relation. The binding procedure identifying the possessor operates at the pragmatic-semantic interface and takes into account the semantic roles of the event participants, their discourse saliency and lexical properties (such as animacy), world knowledge, properties of the possessum (such as the degree of (in)alienability), etc. The external-possession relation and the meaning of the hosting construction are orthogonal to each other, but there is a strong interplay between them. Positing a dedicated external-possessor construction faces the following problems: the same binding procedure is found in other constructions as well (such as the monotransitive or ditransitive constructions); at the same time, the very possession relation is only inconsistently found in constructions referred to as external-possessor constructions, and, what is more, the possession relation may sometimes be canceled (even if it is inalienable). To account for this terminologically, I introduce the term non-thematic affectee construction , a subtype of which is the free (non-thematic) affectee construction particularly spread in European languages. The latter is found with different types of coding (accusative, dative, different prepositional phrases) which have different diachronic sources.",

The child at the end of the first year of life is seemingly equipped cognitively and socially with the basic skills necessary to learn language. The last half of the second year sees a renewed progression that leads finally to a new level of functioning culminating in the acquisition of the adult language system beginning about the age of two. The chapter presents a hypothesis about development during that time within and without language, evidence from existing literature. Infant cognition has been viewed in terms of the child's understanding of the physical world, in particular the understanding of objects and relations between objects— for example, movement in space, causality, and temporal order.",

However, that is not an abstract fact, but a definition of the situation that is a social achievement. This achievement is consequential: it allows for a form of everyday communication from which intention is drained, but judgment is not. Little dramas of discomposure are thus important elements of face‐work that can be analyzed as such: They allow for a negotiation of identity through reaction to ascriptions made by others, but reactions that remain on the back stage and thus avoid negotiations of rank and hierarchy that would usually accompany communications of judgment.",

      "abstract": "A self-report instrument yielded two separate factors: private body consciousness (awareness of internal sensations) and public body consciousness (awareness of observable aspects of body). For each factor, norms, test-retest reliability data, and correlations with other personality measures are presented. An experiment on reaction to ingestion of caffeine revealed that only subjects high in private body consciousness or high in both private body consciousness and private selfconsciousness were stimulated by caffeine; individual differences in public body consciousness and in private self-consciousness alone had no impact. These findings have implications for biofeedback, false physiological feedback, and excitation transfer. When we attend to ourselves, what do we observe? Though there may be various answers to this question, one is to classify the diverse components of the self into private and public aspects. The private aspects can be observed only by the experiencing person: thoughts, images, memories, motives, and feelings—all concerning oneself. The public aspects can be observed by anyone else: appearance, manners, and style of behavior. People differ considerably in the extent to which they attend to the private aspects of themselves, and there are marked individual differences in consciousness of the public or social aspects of oneself. These two dispositions, private and public self-consciousness, are measured by the Self-Consciousness Inventory (Fenigstein, Scheier, & Buss, 1975). Among the highest loading items on the Private Self-Consciousness Scale are, I reflect about myself a lot, I'm generally attentive to my inner feelings, and I'm alert to changes in my mood.

In a person's life, one manifestation of inauthenticity is that of insincerity: not meaning what one says or feels, pretending to have sentiments (I use the term in a Humean sense, to include beliefs and desires as well as less obviously cognitive feelings and emotions) that one does not in fact have. And it is sometimes said that there is an analogous case in the arts: that one way in which a work of art may be inauthentic is in virtue of being insincere, of expressing or articulating sentiments which are or were not in fact those of the artist. In what follows, I wish to consider whether this is correct; whether insincerity may indeed be a manifestation of inauthenticity in the arts, and in particular in poetry. Can the fact that a poet is insincere, in the sense that her poems express sentiments which she does not feel, make those poems inauthentic?",

      "abstract": "Abstract The external world is represented intrapsychically in a specific way. Following the age of an infant, for example, the structure, quality, and the degree of symbolization will be different. The term representation in science is filled with different contents. In psychoanalysis, we see a development from Sigmund Freud's “(Sach‐ or Wort‐)Vorstellungen” to internal objects, then to self–object representations and finally—following newer results of the concept of intersubjectivity and especially under the influence of infant mental‐ and interactional research—to self–object interaction representations. Some aspects of this development are presented more in detail. Knowing that on one hand, interaction in external reality is structured by the self–object interaction representations of each interacting partner and that on the other hand, what happens during the interactions in external reality modifies the representational world of all the interactive persons (i.e., their inner reality), one can observe constant movements from inside to outside (e.g., transference, action) and from outside to inside of the individual (e.g., perception, stimulation, containment, modification). Clinical implications for the actual way of understanding are manifold, but are here only very shortly delineated.",

      "title": "JOURNAL DISCUSSION The Ethical Force of Stories: Narrative Ethics and Beyond",
      "abstract": "Things get murkier with the attempt to “use narrative toward ethical ends” [2]. The relationship between understanding a patient’s illness experience and making ethical decisions about his or her care—without recourse to such other ethics approaches as principlism, casuistry, or virtue ethics—is neither obvious nor uncomplicated. Narrative ethics’ claim is that one can “gain ethical insight and wisdom directly from narratives and without appealing to rules, principles, or other ethical constructs” [2]. Aesop’s fables make a similar claim—the morals derive from the stories. If the grasshopper sings and dances all summer (while the ant is laying-in food), and he therefore starves in winter, a child unschooled in moral theory or principles can deduce that the grasshopper’s actions have brought him a certain sort of harm— death. (Unless, as in some revisionist versions of the story, the saintly ant pities the grasshopper and takes him in for the winter). But, just as with principlism and even virtue ethics, the trouble comes when the narratives (or principles or virtues) conflict. Listen to the grasshopper’s side of the story. The miserable little ant spends the glorious summer carrying crumbs as big as she is on her back—she can neither see the sun nor feel its warmth—all to sustain life in an uncomfortably cold mound during the winter waiting for the next summer’s drudgery to begin. (Aesop’s fabled insects lived multi-year lives.) “You call that living,” the grasshopper might declaim as he goes out in a blazing dance of defiance during the red and gold profusion of autumn. This all sounds quite silly, but can be deadly serious when the grasshopper is a 20-something motorcyclist who refuses leg",

This is manifested as a standoff, a resistance, and a denial of the good object and, therefore, of the symbolization process that is part of healthy development. This is usually due to troubled family histories and a destructive projective identification process. The ego defensively blocks acknowledgment of any symbolizing capacity within the self and within the maternal object out of envy, fear of rejection, and dread of persecution. Destruction of symbolization and the experience of goodness within the self or in the object provides an artificial respite from the threat of annihilation, yet quickly brings on even greater levels of internal chaos and anxiety.

It is a matter of experience that the sense of understanding other people's actions draws continually on familiar and subjective elements by which we attribute to others states of mind, desire, motive and purpose that we can recognise in ourselves, or feel we could. They help to make these other people's actions intelligible. We impute understanding of the purpose or feelings of the actors to them. It is often implicit and intrinsic in the verbs or words we use to describe human behaviour (e.g. ‘announce’, ‘give’, ‘feed’, ‘welcome’, ‘answer’, ‘punish’). This is generally so in the description of human behaviour, whatever the writer and his purpose – novelist, historian, anthropologist, journalist, psychologist or philosopher. Description and interpretation of human behaviour are often bound together. Wholly objective descriptions of human behaviour (and ‘pure’ descriptions of social actions a fortiori) are very hard to provide. We do not register human behaviour in a simple objective fashion but we continually seek to recognise and translate it as we perceive it into terms of understanding if we can. We do this without thinking in everyday life; many words we use to think or speak about human behaviour imply such understanding willy-nilly. But it is also a matter of everyday experience that we sometimes find other people's actions hard to understand. The effort of attempting to and failing makes by contrast the interpretative element, which is usually present but implicit, more explicit.",

The level of communication he must have had in mind lies deep in the human dependency on expressive symbols. These primary factors of human experience—primary in the sense that nothing stands between them and the raw sensations and impulses—are made up of words, gestures, and images which are, in turn, invariably organized in systems or complexes.

      "abstract": "In the last decade and a half, the amount of work on affect in general and emotion in particular has grown, in empirical psychology, cognitive science and AI, both for scientific purposes and for the purpose of designing synthetic characters, e.g. in games and entertainments. Such work understandably starts from concepts of ordinary language (e.g. “emotion”, “feeling”, “mood”, etc.). However, these concepts can be deceptive: the words appear to have clear meanings but are used in very imprecise and systematically ambiguous ways. This is often because of explicit or implicit pre-scientific theories about mental states and process. More sophisticated theories can provide a basis for deeper and more precise concepts, as has happened in physics and chemistry. In the Cognition and Affect project we have been attempting to explore the benefits of developing architecture-based concepts, i.e. starting with specifications of architectures for complete agents and then finding out what sorts of states and processes are supported by those architectures. So, instead of presupposing one theory of the architecture and explicitly or implicitly basing concepts on that, we define a space of architectures generated by the CogAff architecture schema, where each supports different collections of concepts. In that space we focus on one architecture H-Cogaff, a particularly rich instance of the CogAff architecture schema, conjectured as a theory of normal adult human information processing. The architecture-based concepts that it supports provide a framework for defining with greater precision than previously a host of mental concepts, including affective concepts. We then find that these map more or less loosely onto various pre-theoretical concepts, such as “emotion”, etc. We indicate some of the variety of emotion concepts generated by the H-Cogaff architecture A different architecture, supporting a different range of mental concepts might be appropriate for exploring affective states of other animals, for instance insects, reptiles, or other mammals, and young children.",

      "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus atau yang biasa dikenal dengan nama Lupus adalah penyakit yang terjadi ketika zat imunitas dalam sistem kekebalan tubuh bereaksi dan bekerja terlalu berlebihan terhadap rangsangan dari benda asing di luar tubuh dan kemudian justru menyerang tubuh sendiri. Orang yang memiliki penyakit lupus biasanya disebut juga dengan odapus. Odapus mengalami dampak fisik dan psikis akibat penyakit yang dimilikinya. Hal tersebut membuat odapus mengalami penurunan fungsi psikis yang signifikan seperti munculnya perasaan kecewa, sedih dan cemas karena tidak bisa melakukan kegiatan seperti biasanya. Fenomena yang terjadi adalah terdapat perilaku unik pada odapus laki-laki dewasa awal di Yayasan Syamsi Dhuha Bandung dimana mereka dapat merasakan kesejahteraan dengan melakukan aktivitas yang sangat kongruen dengan potensi serta nilai yang dimiliki atau disebut dengan eudaimonic well being (Waterman, 2010) . Berdasarkan pada tinjauan yang lebih mendalam, terdapat adanya usaha odapus untuk lebih fokus melihat secara lebih mendalam mengenai aspek-aspek dan nilai yang positif tentang dirinya dan menghindari umpan balik negatif dari dalam diri ataupun orang lain yang disebut dengan self enhancement (Sedikides, 2007). Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah korelasi, dengan populasi sebanyak 23 orang. Hasil korelasi keduanya termasuk ke dalam kategori tinggi dengan nilai rs; 0,731.",

      "title": "The Nature, Scope, and Implications of a Personal Moral Duty to Die",
      "abstract": "In the relevant circumstance of both relatively high burden or cost to others and low prospective gain for themselves, people have a prima facie duty to die sooner rather than later. This duty is a personal moral duty, not a \"societal\" duty, and thus, it in no way implies that others may demand that it be exercised. It is literally a duty to let death come, not a more general duty to die that encompasses active measures to ensure death. A person can owe this duty not only to close family and loved ones when they are heavily burdened, but in the right circumstances also to more distant persons, even to \"society\"; the fundamental reason is fairness to others in the society or insurance pool, given one's own evaluative preferences about trade-offs involving expensive, low-chance-of-benefit care. This personal moral duty to die does not extend to incompetent patients, at least not in any literal sense. The duty to die also does not jeopardize the marital vow, \"for better or worse, in sickness and in health\"; the creative and mutual relationship envisioned in a marital promise does not bar people from ever coming to think that they may be obligated to accept death because of effects on a spouse. Finally, although this duty is rooted in sensitivity to considerations of quality of life, it need not threaten the \"special\" value of individual life and lifesaving.",

      "abstract": "It is necessary that the adolescent be prepared to face the bio-psycho-social changes that are implicit in this period of growth. This allows the constructive participation in the second process of separation and individualisation. Should this separation be lacking there is the risk of a developmental breakdown (Laufer and Laufer, 1984). In this situation the appearance of self destructive behaviors can be fatal as seen in anorexia, bulimia, drug dependency and suicide. The roots of these self destructive choices seem to be found in the lack of clear definition of the initial process of separation and individualisation from the first part of the second year to the end of the third due to relational disturbance in the mother-child relationship in the symbiotic phase (beginning of the third month-end of the first year). One of the constants in the behavior of an addict that can be found in most self-destructive behaviors is the concept of one's body as an enemy. In order to maintain a connection to his archaic parental objects that allow him to protect an ideal self image, the addict denies the reality of his body. The extreme consequence of this can be found in the paradoxical and delirious decision to « die so as not to die ». There is a moment in the life of the addict in which a change from addiction as a search for pleasure turns into addiction as a game with death. The addict becomes convinced that it is worth while to risk death so as to live. In other words his behavior becomes very similar to the ordalic, where, challenging death, he repeatedly attacks his own security",

Affective forces, such as sexist or racist abuse hurled at bodies online or in the street, are entangled with more recognisable, codified emotions (fear, shame, hate).

Affect displaces reason/emotion, mind/body, self/other binaries and offers alternative – and more affirmative – explanations of how and why sensation and feeling matter. Affect studies have a long philosophical history, reaching back to Spinoza's interest in the capacities of bodies and how bodies can affect and be affected.

A mechanism known in psychoanalytic theory as displacement consists in the moving of genital affects from a primary object or function to a secondary one. When displaced associations become attached with sufficient tenacity to the secondary object, the latter may assume the functions of the first and may eventually become a welcome substitute for the primary one in fulfilling certain emotional needs of the organism. Such substitutes are utilized in the unconsciousness of sleep or unconsciously in the waking state.

      "abstract": "I present a hypothesis concerning the neuronal, mental and behavioral effects of all kinds of affective (emotional) stimuli, i.e., of unpleasant and pleasant stimuli. I use the term stimulus in its broad sense. Affective stimuli evoke two associated percepts: cognitive and affective. A food in the mouth, for example, evokes the gustatory percept and the percept of pleasure. However, affective percepts are unstable parts of cognitive-affective compounds. Five types of affective percepts are pain, fear, pleasure, and appetite in the broad sense of these words. Desire is evoked by inadequate pleasant stimuli. Affective percepts are lower or higher. The latter are not directly associated with bodily needs. Esthetic and social percepts are higher, for example. Although pain and pleasure are essentially innate, they can be modified by sensory experience. Alimentary and esthetic preferences and social values are modifiable, for example. The neurons of pain and fear and of the unpleasant components of desire and appetite motivate four types of voluntary actions. These are, respectively, escape, avoidance, and approach actions. All these actions eliminate the motivating displeasure. In addition, avoidance actions protect from the signaled pain, optimization actions increase the existing pleasure and approach actions provide the signaled pleasure. Thus, voluntary actions associated with different percepts occur according to one universal principle. Voluntary actions are and behavioral. During internal actions a goal and then an action plan are decided. These actions often provide the images of the goal stimuli and of particular movements.",

Among the clinical constellation offered by obese patients it could be worthwile to distinguish: 1.

Conversely, in some other cases, psychological induced behavioral abnormalities are able to lead to an overstepping of the so called \"normal\" weight; 3. In other instances, the alimentary behavior reflects the elevation of the set point for weight. All these mechanisms are mutally reinforcing and could act simultaneously or successively accounting for the great variability of the individual situations.

There is a need for phenomenological descriptions of these experiences and the ways in which they differ from culturally defined psychopathological states. In this semi-structured interview study, eight congregants attending an evangelical church in London were asked to describe their experiences of God communicating with them. Communications from God were related to current events rather than to the prediction of future events. These communications were received as thoughts and do not generally reveal metaphysical insights, but rather they relate to the mundane world. They provided direction, consolation and empowerment in the lives of those receiving them. Individuals recounted that on occasion God sometimes speaks audibly, or accompanied by supernatural phenomena, but in the vast majority of cases, the way God speaks is through thoughts or impressions. In all instances, agency is maintained, individuals can choose to obey the thoughts/voices or not. The findings are discussed in relation to externalisation of agency and the phenomenon of thought insertion in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "When companion animal interact closely with people, the roles they play may be categorized in terms of three major functions. The projective function involves the extent to which pets may serve as a symbolic extension of the self. The sociability function involves the role of pets in facilitating human-to-human interaction. The surrogate function involves the extent to which interaction with pets may supplement human-to-human interaction, or serve as a substitute for it. A person publicly identified with a companion animal makes a symbolic statement of their personality and self-image. Whether or not this process is intentional, the presence of a pet and the way it is treated become factors which are taken into account in the assessment of the social self. Pets facilitate interaction by being social lubricants. They provide a neutral subject of conversation, and perform a variety of functions as social catalysts. Since interaction with companion animals can approximate human companionship, the presence of pets may serve to supplement the benefits usually derived from the roles of friend, parent, spouse, or child. Alternatively, pets may serve as surrogate antagonists. In the extreme, interaction with companion animals may not only supplement human companionship, but may actually replace it. These three major functions are discussed with examples. Implications are noted for future research on companion animals.",

The representations in the brain are rich in information processing and reflect bodily engagement. Bodily representations are inherent in what has been traditionally called the “moral sentiments” (A. Smith, 1759/1976; table 4.1). Darwin (1871/1982) repeatedly referred to the “moral sense.” He asserted, “Any animal whatever, endowed with a well-marked social instinct, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense of conscience, as soon as its intellectual power had become as well or nearly as well developed as in man” (p. 95).

Specifically, we assume that at least some uses of terms such as think, know, and want can reveal the speaker’s understanding of beliefs and desires, core concepts in an everyday theory of mind. An example might be Mark’s statement above that “he thought there were haunted things in his house.” Of course, charting children’s concepts by examining their everyday language is not simple. On the one hand, children (and adults) may use terms like think, know, or want without any conception of, or reference to, beliefs and desires. For example, they might learn to say “Know what?” to gain a listener’s attention without any deeper understanding of notions such as knowledge or knowing. Or they might say “I don’t know” in a ritualistic way, as perhaps Ross does above. On the other hand, children might understand something of beliefs and desires but never talk about them. Or they might talk about such mental states but never use conventional terms like think and want. In these ways, among others, children’s language might underestimate or overestimate their understanding.",

The symbiotic-narcissistic basal relationship of early childhood is reactivated in each later object relation. On this basis all active ego performances are built up, as e.g. the projective identification (archaic form), the identification, the transference (in psychotherapy), the regression etc. as well as the delimination from the object. The next level of the object relation is that of the free decision for or against an object. People with narcissistic personality disorders (narcissistic neuroses), having a constituent ego, and borderline personality disorders which occur in individuals with a fragmentation-prone ego, have suffered in their early childhood under deficiency experiences or the experiences of overprotection or of an attention under conditions. The more the individuals were disturbed also in their ego functions, the more an incapacity of the infant has to be supposed to experience or to admit the attention really presented to it. In major depressions the narcissistic emptiness or depletion seems to be at least partially the consequence of a genetic predisposition.",

      "title": "Stories That are Ready to Break",
      "abstract": "When illness is protracted, when there is no chance of return to the person one once was, or when there is no hope of being \"normal,\" a person's very sense of self is lived in a special way through the body. Personal identity becomes intimately tied to the pain, uncertainty, and stigma that come with an affl icted body. What might it mean to be healed when a cure is only a distant possibility or no possibility at all? The inevitable poverty of biomedical responses to this question has a great deal to do with why narrative is so irresistible. Stories, told or acted, offer healing possibilities that reach far beyond the purview of biomedicine. They can help transform identity, interpret the meaning of the past and even provide images of possible futures. This narrative potential has spawned a wealth of scholarship on the relation of narrative, illness, and personal identity. (See, e.g., Bülow & Hydén, 2003; Becker, 1997; Brockmeier, 2002; Cain, 1991; Charon & Montello, 2002; Frank, 1995; Garro, 2000; Good & Good, 1994; Greenhalgh & Hurwitz, 1998; Hydén, 1997; Kleinman, 1988; Medved & Brockmeier, 2004; Monks, 2000; Morris, 1998.) But stories have insidious potential as well, closing down possibilities, cloaking power in the name of \"stating the facts,\" preventing the very changes that might lead to healing. The very form of stories may oppress, forcing a meaning that denies or overrides a chaotic or inarticulate personal experience. Kirmayer, for example, contends that the coherence that is part of a well-told tale can distance the sufferer from her experience of suffering. Stories can be vehicles for ideology making, especially when coconstructed with powerful physicians, producing texts that are, from the patient's point of view, experience distant. Metaphors and \"fragmentary stories, narrative strands\" may be more revealing than a fi nely wrought narrative (Kirmayer 2000, p. 171). Unni Wikan (2000) also objects that sometimes stories present life in an overly coherent way and cannot necessarily be called upon when facing an unpredictable illness. It may even be that silences or half-told tales disclose more about what it is like to be fl attened by a serious and unexpected illness, to \"fall out of one's life,\" as Gadamer (1996, p. 42) puts it.",

      "title": "FALSE RECOGNITION OF UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE: \"SEEING FILM STARS EVERYWHERE\"",
      "abstract": "Abstract A patient (MR) is reported who is able to correctly recognise famous people as being familiar but has a strong tendency to falsely recognise unfamiliar people as being familiar. False recognition does not depend on the type of person involved (contemporary, historical, fictional) or the modality in which it is presented (face, spoken/written name). False recognition does not extend to vocabulary knowledge, to other proper name categories (e.g. places) or to news events. Several hypotheses are considered but discounted. False recognition does not reflect reliance on familiarity associated with parts of the stimuli as opposed to the whole. False recognition, instead, depends critically on the nature of the referent (i.e. whether it refers to a person or not) and not on the nature of the stimulus material. Thus, MR will not produce false recognition when asked to search for names that refer to song or book titles even when, in all other respects, the stimuli resemble the names of people (e.g. Eleanor Rigby, David Copperfield). It is suggested that this disorder stems from a top-down failure to regulate the person recognition system, such that inappropriate information is retrieved. The category specificity may reflect inappropriate use of meta-memory knowledge concerning the rate of potential new exemplars from the category of \"people\" relative to other categories.",

      "abstract": "Social animals, like humans, need to interact with others, but this is not always possible. When genuine social interaction is lacking, individuals may seek out or use sources of interaction that co-opt agency detection mechanisms vis-à-vis the human voice and images of people, called social snacking. Study 1 ( N = 240) found that ratings of how alone participants felt were correlated with frequency of talking to themselves and using the TV for company. Study 2 ( N = 66) was a daily diary study where loneliness was correlated with both Study 1 behaviors and singing to oneself. These solutions essentially trick the person's brain into feeling like they are socially interacting, thus, appeasing the relative dependence humans have on social interaction. Social snacking may satisfy one's need for social interaction because humans are unlikely to be able to differentiate between virtual and real people because this distinction did not exist in ancestral environments.",

First, the mentalistic explanations of behavior that occur in everyday talk have no place in a science of behavior. Mental causes of behavior are fictional. The origins of behavior lie in heredity and in the environment, present and past. Second, in a science of behavior, everyday mentalistic terms like believe, expect, and intend either must be avoided or carefully redefined. Third, private events, if they need to be spoken of at all, are natural and share all the properties of public behavior. Even if they are to be spoken of, their origins lie in the environment, just like other behavior; behavior never originates in private events. Molar behaviorists circumvent the need to give private events any explanatory role by conceiving of behavior as organized into activities that occur over extended periods of time and sometimes include talking about private events.",

      "title": "Hostile, Sexual, and Other Social Behaviour Patterns of the Spice Finch (Lonchura Punctulata) in Captivity",
      "abstract": "Three main groups of social reactions, commonly observed in captive Spice Finches, are the main subjects of this paper. The first group comprises a number of patterns reflecting the Spice Finch's highly gregarious nature and often helping to maintain flock integration: Call Notes, Tail-flicking (a ritualized locomotory intention movement), clumping (roosting or sitting absolutely side by side), and social preening. The Spice Finch's general social behaviour suggests that the gregariousness of the species is due to some motivation partially independent of any other possibly activated tendencies. The same may be of the marked restlessness shown in the early mornings throughout the year. The second group contains many hostile activities : attack, escape, and patterns obviously produced by a simultaneous conflict or combination of attack and escape motivations. Among these last, several stretch postures are particularly interesting : the fact that each of them may frequently occur just before attack, just before escape and in numerous intermediate situations indicates that they are all ambivalent locomotory intention movements similar to one another in every respect except orientation. Another pattern resulting from simultaneously activated attack and escape tendencies, the Ruffle, is a ritualized display. This pattern bears some physical resemblance to friendly social preening invitation and it is tentatively suggested that it helps to avert attack by means of this resemblance. Despite the occasional frequency of Ruffling, and the rarer appearance of certain vocal patterns, Spice Finch hostile behaviour is much less ritualized than that of many other species. This paucity of ritualization, with the accompanying sombreness of plumage and weakness of voice, is probably correlated with the extreme gregariousness - which has probably reduced the need for behaviour patterns conspicuous over long distances. The third group, much the most heterogeneous, comprises sexual activities and other activities more or less closely associated with sexual performances. One such pattern, the masculine Jingle (reminiscent of, but functionally unlike, the true or advertising song of other passerines), is also common in non-sexual situations, and must, again, have some largely independent motivation. Typical and atypical behaviour before, during, and after copulation itself is described in some detail. The pre-copulatory sequence of patterns is almost always elaborate, including unritualized ambivalent postures and movements, ritualized displays, and (possibly) one conventional displacement activity. Another striking pre-copulatory performance, playing with nest-material, seems to result from a type of spark-over or re-routing of motivation very different from the spark-over responsible for conventional displacement activities. This pre-copulatory nest-building is not produced by a surplus of motivation (as would be the case in conventional conflict or thwarting), but apparently, instead, by an insufficiency of sexual motivation, too weak to be expressed in overt sexual acts. The theoretical advantages of such an arrangement are very great. The actual copulation is quick and simple, but there are violent post-copulatory performances. The whole series of patterns before, during, and after copulation can be understood as the result, in both sexes, of simultaneously activated attack, escape, and sexual tendencies of varying strengths, with, in the male, an added simultaneous Jingling tendency.",

For example, conditioned reinforcers are not automatically reinforcing. Stimuli or events which were once neutral in value may acquire reinforcing properties as a result of being paired with events which are already reinforcing — either primary or other conditioned reinforcers. By repeatedly presenting a neutral stimulus prior to or along with a reinforcing stimulus, the neutral stimulus becomes a reinforcer. For example, praise may not be reinforcing for some people: therefore to establish it as a reinforcer it must be paired with an event that is reinforcing, such as food or money. Then when a behaviour is performed, the individual is praised and reinforced with money. After several pairings of the praise with money, the praise alone will serve as a reinforcer.",

Applebee re-examined the stories in terms of structural organisation, and found six basic structures. The least structured organisation characterises what are hardly stories at all, but rather a string of events, a kind of free association showing few links from one sentence to the next. The Crediton Project was a study carried out by Wilkinson, Barnsley, Hanna and Swan into the development of children's writing. In sum, these accounts of studies of children's oral story-making, their responses to stories and their writing all show developmental trends which reflect characteristics of cognitive development in general.",

This idea has been developed anew, particularly for the human case, in a number of different disciplines for a variety of different reasons. Goody (this volume), points to a number of instances, and the list could be extened almost ad nauseam. It ranges from computer scientists proposing plan-construction algorithms and user-modelling procedures for natural language front-ends, to economists speculating on the actions of economic agents planning their moves in the market-place with respect to the actions of others. The scope and explanatory range of this idea in any of these fields has always been questionable. In economics, for example, the very different effects of ignorance, habit and culture on individual choice have often been far greater than those of individual ratiocination. Nevertheless, any area of human activity which involves actual or potential interaction with other humans (and that might mean all of human life) can be seen to have characteristics which reveal an anticipation of how others will view and respond to one's actions.",

Automatic social responses are likely to invoke established social rules and dynamics from offline interactions so that they are transferred to online interactions with avatars. Social interaction relies on smooth synchronization, which can be difficult to achieve in online communication. Interaction behavior depends on goals, but the precise form of the behavior is dependent on societal norms, roles, understandings, and customs organized into expected interaction patterns resulting from past experiences. Burgoon and Walther define interaction expectations as cognitions about the anticipated communication behavior of specific others. In naturalistic situations, schema and goal activation is often automatic. Hence, interactions meeting expectations and norms of a relational schema move along relatively automatically as exchanges that fit with expectancies have little need for conscious monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Using an example of a goose which grew up in complete isolation, this article shows how escape behaviour increases through all its developmental steps by lack of a sufficient secure primary attachment object. If a gosling has no mother, its fear influences wide parts of its behaviour and blocks the capacity to approach another animal in order to form a new attachment. But the urge for attachment is still alive and provokes strong conflicts between this urge and fear. In these situations displacement activities and apathy occur--attachment-disordered behaviour. Under partly artificial circumstances, a change to 'normal' attachment behaviour took place by reduction of escape motivation, which enabled the goose to accept her brood. From this moment on the attachment-disordered behaviour, the displacement activity and the apathy disappeared. Implications to human behaviour are drawn--a comparison between displacement activity and neurotic symptoms, the state of apathy and personal disorder. A synthesis of ethological and psychoanalytical models concerning etiological and therapeutic aspects is discussed. Fear and attachment, not aggression and sexuality--our 'animal heritage'--are the primary factors which influence our development. The balance of fear and attachment is the basis for a healthy or unhealthy development of social relationships. This applies to social living animals as well as to humans.",

This may occur in at least two ways-by anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents such as nonhuman animals and gadgets to make them appear more humanlike and by increasing belief in commonly anthropomorphized religious agents (such as God). Three studies support these hypotheses both among individuals who are chronically lonely (Study 1) and among those who are induced to feel lonely (Studies 2 and 3). Additional findings suggest that such results are not simply produced by any negative affective state (Study 3). These results have important implications not only for understanding when people are likely to treat nonhuman agents as humanlike (anthropomorphism), but also for understanding when people treat human agents as nonhuman (dehumanization).",

      "abstract": "Human aggression typologies largely correspond with those for other animals. While there may be no non-human equivalent of angry reactive aggression, we propose that human proactive aggression is similar to offense in other animals' dominance contests for territory or social status. Like predation/hunting, but unlike defense, offense and proactive aggression are positively reinforcing, involving dopamine release in accumbens. The drive these motivational states provide must suffice to overcome fear associated with initiating risky fights. We term the neural activity motivating proactive aggression \"non-angry aggressive arousal\", but use \"angriffsberietschaft\" for offense motivation in other animals to acknowledge possible differences. Temporal variation in angriffsberietschaft partitions fights into bouts; engendering reduced anti-predator vigilance, redirected aggression and motivational over-ride. Increased aggressive arousal drives threat-to-attack transitions, as in verbal-to-physical escalation and beyond that, into hyper-aggression. Proactive aggression and offense involve related neural activity states. Cingulate, insular and prefrontal cortices energize/modulate aggression through a subcortical core containing subnuclei for each aggression type. These proposals will deepen understanding of aggression across taxa, guiding prevention/intervention for human violence.",

      "abstract": "This article differentiates between psychological trauma resulting from natural events and trauma that results at the hands of other human beings—malignant trauma. In malignant trauma, cure is not attainable because the core of traumatic experience remains in part untouched by symbolic expressions, leaving a person with a sense of inarticulateness and isolation. Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of loss: (a) shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a cry; (d) loss of trust associated with the experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of an other's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs. These losses defy symbolization because symbolization is contingent upon constitutional biological structures and experiences of an obliged, trustworthy, and faithful other.",

We, however, are accustomed to according greater value to purely subjective qualities. Whenever the author tried to ascertain what a person thought or felt about a particular event, or another person, villagers would typically respond by declaring, \"I am not inside them\" (n'de sa bu ro), or \"I do not know what is inside\" (n'de ma konto lon), thereby reminding us that what matters is how a person behaves in relation to others, irrespective of what is in his heart or on his mind. As for intelligence, this was not defined by the esoteric knowledge you possessed any more than wealth was defined by the money you had in the bank or the amount of rice in your granary. Rather, it was expressed in the adroitness with which you engaged with others – the way you greeted or cooperated with them, the way you performed your duties and met your obligations. This ethos extended to emotionality. Unless one's personal feelings had some social value, they should not be publicly expressed.",

      "abstract": "To possess the virtue of honesty or kindness, it is not enough to act sometimes in honest or kind ways. Virtues, like character traits in general, are standing properties of agents that explain their actions. Over the past decade or so, philosophers have debated whether the findings of experimental social psychology undermine the traditional confidence that people do indeed possess such dispositions. This debate has supposed that dispositions are states that generate a particular kind of output from a particular kind of input. The fragility of a vase, on this view, is the disposition to shatter when struck with a certain amount of force. Likewise, the virtue of compassion is, or includes, a disposition to respond to other people's suffering, or the prospect of it, with actions, or at least thoughts and feelings, that tend towards alleviating or averting that suffering. The disagreement has concerned whether people really can develop dispositions to respond appropriately to such a stimulus irrespective of the fine details of the context in which that stimulus occurs (see Miller, this volume, Chapter 37). However, there are many virtues and other character traits that are not properly understood in terms of stimulus and response. The virtues of constancy, fidelity and integrity form one cluster of such traits. These traits may be displayed in behaviour in difficult circumstances, but what seems essential to them is not the way in which one responds to any particular kind of situation.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The physiology of the emotional response patterns to “stressful” psychosocial stimuli is surveyed. These limbic‐hypothalamic patterns are basically designed to protect the individual and species from adverse environmental influences in primitive life. Their expressions always form a triad, with a situation‐specific “somatomotor”‐behav‐ioural link, a “visceromotor”‐autonomic and a hormonal link, the latter two adjusting inner organs, metabolism, water‐salt balance, etc., to provide optimal support to the behavioural expression. Because of their uniformity throughout species, animal experiments have greatly contributed to our understanding of how these responses may also importantly contribute to common disorders in modern society, at least when intensely and/or commonly evoked. Thanks to our more advanced neocortex, man differs here from animals mainly in two ways. First, we learn to cope with some environmental stimuli and thus delimit undue emotional engagements; second, when once elicited we can often suppress the behavioural link, when this is socially appropriate. As we cannot suppress the autonomic‐hormonal links, however, they then occur more or less “in vain”, and such socially enforced dissociations of per se normal response patterns may not in the long run be healthy. Finally, the better known among these differentiated responses are briefly outlined, with particular emphasis on the potentially most important ones, the “defence reaction” and the “defeat reaction”.",

In our everyday lives, many different kinds of considerations are invoked to explain these “special” responsibilities.

Or perhaps we feel indebted to him because of something heonce did for us. Or, again, perhaps we once harmed him in some way, and as a result we feel a responsibility to make reparation to him.

      "abstract": "Synaesthesia is the confusion or conflation of sensory modalities, where one sense is experienced or described in terms of another as in Charles Baudelaire’s simile \"perfumes sweet as oboes, green as prairies.\" Synaesthesia captures an already existing tendency in language to blend the senses as in \"sweet melody,\" \"velvety voice,\" or \"loud colors,\" and psychologists have conducted studies that show our shared experience of weak audiovisual associations between low pitch and darker colors, or high pitch and lighter colors. In a strictly neurological sense, synaesthesia is a perceptual condition in which the stimulation of one sensory system (for example, hearing) triggers sensations in another sensory system (for example, vision). Cross-sensory associations form one-to-one correspondences that are stable, delicately nuanced, and highly individual. For instance, a synaesthete may experience the timbre of violins as lime green, or the pitch A as burgundy. Synaesthetic associations occur as involuntary, automatic, and emotional responses to sensory stimuli. They persist throughout life and often aid memory: some synaesthetes reliably remember historical dates thanks to their color-to-number associations. The prevalence of synaesthesia has been contested over time, with varying ratios of synaesthetes to nonsynaesthetes of 1 in 2,000, 1 in 100 for colored letters and numbers in recent studies, and even 1 in 23 for all types of synaesthesia.",

      "title": "What Is General Semantics?: A Personal View.",
      "abstract": "Sometimes when people ask What General Semantics?, don't want to answer. My reluctance to categorize general semantics arises from the general semantics principle of non-identity. This postulates that no two things are identical in all respects. Suppose say, a Such a sentence uses a form of is called the is-of-identity. It violates the non-identity principle. In effect, I've said, individual noun (Pat) equals class noun (politician), X identical to Y, identical to This seems harmless, you say. Not so! Tunnel Vision I've confused the specific with the general, confused things with words, and imposed linguistic limitations that do not reflect the rich diversity of a living human who has personality, hopes, habits, a certain physique, etc. I've reduced Pat to a label, politician. My self-imposed tunnel vision will prejudge and damage my relationship with Pat. By treating this individual as identical to a class, category, or group, can't help but think and act as if all politicians are alike. If a particular politician has disappointed me, will probably react badly to all. Labels That Limit Suppose we have a task to do, and we only have a We can say, I can't do it, only have a screwdriver. In practice, we can use a screwdriver to drive screws, to hammer, chisel, lever, wedge, garden, open cans, crack ice, stir liquids, etc. Similarly, we can use the numerous tools of general semantics to achieve diverse goals. Hence my reluctance to limit general semantics with is-of-identity labeling. Yet to describe, we must focus, select, abstract. Incidentally, a key formulation of the system of general semantics says that we process information at biological and verbal levels by abstracting, by leaving things out. We've chosen not to describe the system by means of the is-of-identity, by what it is. We can describe something by what it does. Success and Survival think of general semantics as a system for making evaluations vital to success and survival. By evaluating, mean our processing of perceptions and inferences as influenced by existing conscious and unconscious assumptions. Evaluations, not necessarily conscious ones, involve our thoughts, feelings, judgments, decisions, etc. Generally we do something as a result. Evaluating leads to appropriate or inappropriate action. We might describe general semantics as an integrated system for improving our thinking, evaluating, communicating, etc. Of course, in doing so we've only just begun. Alfred Korzybski formulated general semantics in the first half of this century in his major work, Science and Sanity, and he continued to write and lecture about general semantics until his death in 1950. Numerous educators, writers, and editors have continued to develop and disseminate his work, including Irving J. Lee, Wendell Johnson, Harry Weinberg, Francis Chisholm, Kenneth Johnson, S. I. Hayakawa, Elwood Murray, Russell Joyner, Robert Pula, Anatol Rapoport, Mary Morain, D. David Bourland, Jr., Susan Presby Kodish, Bruce I. Kodish, Earl Hautala, Jeremy Klein, and Gregory Sawin. Beyond Aristotle Korzybski called general semantics a non-Aristotelian system because its many-valued logic goes beyond the two-valued, either-or logic attributed to Aristotle. Two-valued Aristotelian logic says either X Y, or X not Y; it offers no middle choices, and it often leads to either-or evaluating. Non-Aristotelian logic employs multiple values, a range of choices, more in keeping with the diversity of lived experience. It adheres to the principle of non-identity by allowing degrees of difference or similarity. Separation of Word and Thing Korzybski recognized that language and lived experience consist of two distinctly separate realms. He said The word not the thing, and Whatever you might say the object 'is,' well, it not. …",

In his first volume on attachment, he quotes Murray (1938) who introduced the use of the word \"affiliation\" to denote \"all manifestations of friendliness and good will, and a desire to do things in the company of others \" (Bowlby, 1969/1982, p. 229). Bowlby goes on to say that \"as such [affiliation] is a much broader concept than attachment and is not intended to cover behaviour that is directed at one or two particular figures, which is the hallmark of attachment behaviour\" (p. 229). Bowlby also made the distinction between playful interactions and attachment:A child seeks his attachment figure when he is tired, hungry, ill, or alarmed and also when he is uncertain of the figure's whereabouts . . . By contrast, a child seeks a playmate when he is in good spirits and confident about the whereabouts of his attachment-figure; when the playmate is found, moreover, the child wants to engage in playful interactions with him or her. If this analysis is right, the roles of the attachment figure and playmate are distinct.",

As revealed in key encounters narrated by Audre Lorde and Harriet McBryde Johnson, however, disabled people’s motions and affective expressions work to “discombobulate” and reorient ableist affective flows. These “crip” disruptions of normative affect can suggest disabled people or figures as “privileged” touchstones for affect theory. Still, such constructions risk further dislocating disabled people from everyday affects and spaces. Accessibility practices offer a different mode of access and (in)attention, in which non-disabled people may experience a discombobulating, self-reflexive attention to their own embodiment and a “touchy-feely” (implicitly femme, queer, crip) openness to varied bodymind needs. In such practices, disability affects find a home in the ordinary.",

The answer lies in the model of the life-space of the things. This space is created by two basic dimensions. The first is defined by the character of the relationships created by the objects (this dimension comprises the opposition between the technical relations versus the communicative ones). The second is defined by the character of the relationship between the body of the user and the material object (this is created by the opposition: accessible or inaccessible to sensory experience). The transition of the material object through this space is the life-way of the object, and it is precisely this which defines the longevity of the object and thus the length of time it persists within a specific community. The author determines that long-lasting objects are above all those which are linked with the community, or users, by single, unambiguous relationships and links, while those which have ambivalent and multiple links are of shorter lifespan. Whether or not a thing has a long life or not is determined therefore by the multiplicity of meanings it has which render impossible its role as a stabiliser of the links that constitute a community, as a foundation of the individual’s identity, a guarantee of ontological security.",

They are so not so much different groups—the categories certainly overlap—as they are different aspects of our collegial relationships. Friends should be understood as enemies of my enemy, those with whom we make common cause. They are by our side at some scholarly barricade or other, perhaps engaging in the critiques of biological or social determinism that were part of my own academic development, or more recently of a variety of genecentrisms, adaptationism, representationalism, or the dominant strains of evolutionary psychology. 1 Such friends and allies tend to encounter each other on panels, in edited volumes, at workshops; on the page they often line up in the same citation-laden parentheses. The question of neighbors arises afterward, on the way home from the barricades, perhaps, when a united front is no longer necessary and you gaze at",

These perceptions of the world become retrospectively altered as developing bodies of knowledge reject them as being clearly deceptive or anachronistic. The concept of psychopathology, distinguished historically under many rubrics, has not been immune to these same processes of modification, nor has it ever been free of the diverse irrationalities which men of all ages have constructed to explain the etiology and treatment of deviant behavior. Historically, consideration of atypical behavior all reflect attempts to explain dysfunction utilizing existing systems of belief and knowledge. For example, primitive and ancient societies advanced quasi-theoretical frameworks that stressed either external causation (e.g., spirit intervention, sorcery, demonic possession, lunacy, bewitchment) or personal causation (e.g., loss of soul, breach of taboo, object intrusion, brain disease).",

      "title": "The Inevitable Pursuit of the Will and the Problem of Merit According to Thomas Aquinas",
      "abstract": "Man's will necessarily pursues what is in accordance with its nature, and accidentally pursues what does not. Since the will pursues whatever it does in accordance with the good or ultimate purpose, it inevitably pursues formal good in general or the ultimate purpose. And the will inevitably pursues existence, preservation of life, social cooperation, and the pursuit of truth according to man's nature. The methods for realizing these goals are chosen haphazardly. However, when the ends according to these natures are in conflict with each other, the will chooses and pursues one by chance. In particular, in the case of the ultimate goal, it includes not only the aspect of self-completion but also the method of realization, and the will has freedom of execution regarding which method of realization the ultimate goal includes. The will can pursue or reject an ultimate goal whose method of realization is worldly values such as pleasure or wealth, or an ultimate goal whose method of realization is goodness itself. In this way, the ultimate goal that the will knows with freedom of execution is inevitably pursued. Because the will has freedom of action in knowing this ultimate end, these activities can be the object of moral merit. Obtaining faith by God's grace and achieving beatific vision in heaven are also inevitably accepted by the will when God's help is provided. When the grace of faith is given, it cannot be refused, and the will cannot be given freedom of action when preparing to accept it. The human will cannot exercise any freedom of choice or action under these conditions. So, although ‘free will in a broad sense’ can be recognized in the will, it is difficult to give merit to such activities. In heaven, the beatified person does not reject the beatific vision but inevitably pursues it because he has a firm inclination toward goodness. However, in order for the beatified person to have a firm inclination toward goodness, a person must have faith and make efforts in accordance with the correct ultimate goal in this life. The virtue achieved through such efforts in this life is not only the grace of God, but also the freedom of practice as ‘free will in a narrow sense’. These activities can be a contribution to the beatific vision achieved in the afterlife. The degree of supernatural virtue and beatific intuition of the beatified person in heaven varies depending on the grace given initially and the merits formed afterwards.",

A musical instrument, a scientific artifact, a collection of sounds, an antique postcard: yes, all these objects are expressive and sometimes aesthetically pleasing, and in being so they can be understood to embody an epistemology, with theories and realms of knowledge written into their every contour. Or they can be understood as traces of global exchange and displacement. But what if the object is not very good, not loveable at all? Crumbling, toxic paper or banal images, with no exit from a strange historical or cultural space, perhaps an uncomfortable space to which you feel averse (or at least, feel you should disdain, as beneath contempt)? Or what if the object is misdirecting? What if it is ephemeral, like sound, something that cannot be held? These questions are woven in this essay into a reflection on the forms taken by certain loves for opera, a reflection centered on some nineteenth-century material objects that relate to act 4 of Giacomo Meyerbeer’s opera Les Huguenots (1836).",

Delingsadfærden hos mennesket antager former, der på nogle punkter er langt mere sammenlignelige med fjernere beslægtede aber end med menneskeaberne. Visse dyrearter viser sig desuden at klare sig mærkbart bedre end menneskeaberne i samarbejdsforsøg, hvor menneskelige signaler skal forstås. Især hunde udmærker sig ved dette og lader til at gå til opgaven med omtrent lige så få gnidninger som småbørn. Dette kan forklares ved, at der implicit i evnen til menneskeligt samarbejde ligger en motivation for at indgå i opgaveløsende relationer og en basal tillidsfuldhed omkring flokmedlemmer, som ikke er en selvfølgelighed for alle flokdyr, men som mennesket har fremavlet hos den tamme hund.",

      "title": "Placebos and Placebo Effects",
      "abstract": "To summarize, the placebo effect occurs if and only if: 1) the patient is a thinking, experiencing, conscious, belief-holding subject; 2) the patient is a member of a culture; 3) the patient has symptoms; 4) the patient stands in a special relation with others who are recognized by the surrounding culture, and by the medical culture, as expert healers or medical authorities; 5) the patient is administered a treatment for his or her disease or disorder by a medical authority or expert healer; 6) the patient's disorder or disease is changed; 7) the change in the patient's disorder or disease is not caused by the hypothesized characteristic factors of the treatment; 8) the change in the disorder or disease is caused by the incidental factors of the treatment.There are several advantages of this definition over Shapiro's, Grünbaum's, and Brody's. First, it recognizes (with Bootzin and Caspi [2002]) the synergistic, multidimensional, and interpersonal nature of the placebo effect. A placebo is not a static and discrete thing like a sugar pill; it is more like an event than a thing. Moreover, the placebo effect is not, strictly, ‘inside the head’ of the patient. It is a culturally situated and interpersonally constituted event; no one responds to placebos in a social and cultural vacuum. Second, the defini tion preserves the centrality accorded to patients’ beliefs in the placebo effect, while also emphasizing (unlike the other definitions) the role of patient affect and conscious awareness; the placebo effect is made possible by the complex interplay of belief, hope, expectation, and emotions, among other variables. Third, the definition is more explicit than the other definitions in what it rules out as possible placebo responders. Anything that is not a conscious, experiencing, belief-holding and culturally situated subject is not a placebo responder. Fourth, the definition offers a more robust and detailed account of what Grünbaum sparingly calls patients’ ‘life processes’ and what Brody sparingly calls ‘healing context’.",

      "abstract": "The notion that the development of certain gastrointestinal disorders and diseases can, at least in part, be ascribed to specific psychological characteristics of the patient, to an antecedent psychologically important event or to an unconscious conflict, is very popular both in the public and the medical profession. One of its earliest formulations was the conversion theory forwarded by Sigmund Freud, who assumed that the accumulation of a traumatic and unabreacted quota of affect induced defense or repression and caused a somatic conversion of emotion, i.e., a transformation into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasms and achalasia, the latter misconceived as \"cardiospasm\", were viewed as conversion symptoms. However, it has become clear that these disorders are the consequence of organic lesions and not of conversion. Similarly, concepts of an aetiological role of a specific psychological factor, a specific conflict, of certain affective states or live events and of \"inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life\" could not be verified. Although psychological characteristics and states have been shown to affect normal gastrointestinal function, there is no evidence to suggest that such influences can lead to gastrointestinal disorders or diseases. The fact that the validity of the concepts claiming such aetiological relationships remained to be tested has been repressed to such an extent in some quarters that these concepts still are advocated so as if they had been proven since long.",

There remains to envisage the means of signification and communication as being imperfect, partial and in incomplete evolution.

That is, there must have been a time before which homo erectus or his kinfolk had learned to speak and to be capable of mentally reflecting about their intentionality. In other words, there was a before and an after. What is not obvious is whether or not ‘afterwards’ was a long, continuous and unfinished process of constant elaboration, or if reflexivity's biography consisted of distinct and discontinuous periods. Another way of putting the same question is: does human reflexivity show distinct variations in the modes through which it is practised and, if so, were such modalities subject to change over time in response to changing historical circumstances?",

      "title": "Claims of Affect: Affectivity as a linguistic and sequential phenomenon",
      "abstract": "This study investigates how conversationalists use emotion in interaction. In analysing audio recordings of American English phone calls, a phenomenon labelled “claims of affect” was found. These are utterances which a speaker uses to claim a particular emotion that he or she feels at a certain point in time and is related to a certain set of events. Linguistically, the phenomenon is versatile in its design. However two main linguistic constructions have emerged. Each structure relies on copular verbs and affective terms. Yet pronoun use differs in each case. The first person pronoun I is commonly used to refer to the speaker herself whereas the third person pronoun it is found to function as a global reference that refers to abstract items such as events, situations and various circumstances. Claims can be located in “pre-cause” and “post- cause” positions. The cause should be understood as a trigger of the emotion that the speaker is claiming to feel. Pre-cause claims topicalise the cause whereas post-cause claims elicit either an aligning or disaligning response depending on the activity the conversationalists are engaged in.\r\nThe responses of second speakers are typically empathetic. By doing an empathetic response second speakers claim to have access to how the claimer feels. In one fragment, a second speaker has been observed to deny the claimer her right to feel in a certain way. This suggests that one aspect of emotion is that it is a public, social phenomenon and not the private, psychological one that some researchers have argued. Conversationalists negotiate their affective lives with their conversational partners in order for them to confirm that their emotional response to a situation is valid. Their partners will therefore judge if this is so. If it is not the case, they will orient the claimer towards it as being an unreasonable claim. This means that they must be appropriate to the cause. If considered invalid the claimer faces a dispreferred response from the second speaker.",

      "abstract": "It is argued that a link prevails between the phenomenology of externality present in classical liberal theory and the state of mind known as schizophrenia. To escape the social reality of possessive individualism, especially the conception of consequences, ends, habits, routine, the schizophrenic individual ‘withdraws’ or regresses into a psychic universe that contains a dimension unrelated to the consciousness and values of externality: the pursuit of wealth and things, the calculated regard of the other as an instrument for enriching the self. The schizophrenic is incapable of adapting his ‘ego’ to the necessities of the social environment; he cannot defend himself in ‘conventional’ or ‘normal’ ways from the demands of living in a social milieu where the expectations and judgments of others impose intolerable pressures on consciousness. Instead the individual undergoing the painful process of withdrawal constructs a set of psychic defenses that from the standpoint of the external world appear to be ‘strange’, ‘odd’, ‘bizarre’, or ‘demented’. The ‘mode of Being’ of the schizophrenic has nothing in common with the life‐style of the acquisitive, status‐conscious society. Some consideration is given to the political implications and meaning of the schizophrenic's withdrawal.",

This paper argues that joint attention has the normative role of enabling subjects to coordinate their actions in a way that would contribute to the rational execution of a joint action in accordance with a prior shared plan or shared intention. This understanding of the normative function of joint attention underpins a particular understanding of the nature of joint attention: what I shall call Rich Relationalism. Rich Relationalism argues for the view that joint attention acts as an epistemically significant interface between the world, other people, and their background plans and concepts. It understands joint attention as an object-dependent, conceptually structured, token experiential state that is shared by two (or more) people. It can be contrasted with non-relational (i.e., Representational or Enactivist) accounts of joint attention on the one hand, and Lean Relationalist accounts on the other (such as John Campbell's influential account).",

      "title": "Pre-Reflective Self-Awareness in Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Disorders of the self figure prominently in psychotic experiences. Subjects de­scribe that “alien” thoughts are inserted in their mind by foreign powers, can sometimes hear their thoughts aloud or describe complex voices interacting with each other. Such experiences can be conceptualized in the framework of a Philosophical Anthropology, which suggests that human experience is characterized by centric and excentric positionality: subjects experience their environment centered around their enlived body and at the same time can reflect upon their place in a shared lifeworld from an excentric point of view. Pre-reflective self awareness has been suggested to ensure that subjects can identify their own thoughts or actions as belonging to themselves, even when they reflect upon them from an excentric point of view. This pre-reflective self awareness appears to be impaired during psychotic experiences, when subjects no longer identify thoughts in their own stream of consciousness as belonging to themselves and instead attribute them to an outside agent. Among several potential causes, it is suggested that such impairments can be due to discrimi­natory or traumatic experiences, which affect the enlived (centric) position of a person and make her feel encircled and deeply threatened by aversive powers. As a consequence, the afflicted individual may fundamentally distance herself from her current centric position in a hostile environment, at the price of experiencing her own thoughts or actions as alien. Philosophical Anthropology may thus help to explain how social exclusion, discrimination and traumatization can promote psychotic experiences and why social support is of primary importance for any treatment of psychosis.",

Because of this, communicative aspects of movement and position, like rules of language structure (grammar, syntax, etc.), have tended to remain “invisible,”overshadowed by subject matter and other expressive means. This is not the case in Scott Burton's Behavior Tableaux, a five-part performance piece composed of approximately 80 silent tableaux vivants. Some tableaux, lasting only a few seconds, are static pictures exhibiting proxemic (spatial) relationships between interactants; others, lasting as long as five minutes, offer isolated elements of kinesic behavior (movement), which develop the scene beyond what could be conveyed by spatial relationships alone. Behavior Tableaux is about how males relate to each other through “body language” and manipulations of “personal space” within five distinct group situations: the harmonious peer-group; the discordant peer-group; the group and leader; the group and outsider; and the “non-group.”",

      "title": "The Politics of Postmodern Jurisprudence",
      "abstract": "never-never land. In the reality of a concrete context, we are able to grasp the point of a text without slipping into an infinite regress bereft of meaning. 73 Moreover, neither traditions nor prejudices are mere mental forms or ideas that can be replaced by simply imagining different forms or ideas. Prejudices and interests often are learned or absorbed in a deep sense; they become in individuals. Prejudices and interests, then, are not like a pair of rose-colored glasses that can be removed and replaced with a pair of green-tinted glasses. To the contrary, once entrenched or learned, particular prejudices and interests are not easily changed or shaken, though they always remain contingent and potentially alterable.74 Additionally, prejudices, interests, and traditions arise from and are constituted by experiences that are mediated through language. And language, as a practical activity, is communicated through concrete experiences and actions.75 For example, a child learns through a multitude of social interactions the meaning of being a doctor in our society. The child might be a patient of a doctor who talks to and physically treats 73. At a particular point in time, a text can seem to have a multiplicity of meanings only if we imagine it as decontextualized, as existing in some abstract sense. But as Stanley Fish notes, we always encounter a text in a concrete context, and hence, the text always has a determinate meaning (though that meaning can change as the context changes). See Stanley Fish, Normal Circumstances, Literal Language, Direct Speech Acts, the Ordinary, the Everyday, the Obvious, What Goes Without Saying, and Other Special Cases, in INTaPREI1vE SOCIAL SCIENCE A READER, supra note 38, at 243, 256. 74. To me, Gadamer does not adequately make this point, although it is implicit in his approach. Pierre Bourdieu's notion of the embodiment of a practice suggests that prejudices and interests should be understood not merely as a state of mind, but as a state of the body. See PIERRE BoURDmu, THE LOGIC OF PRACTICE 68 (Richard Nice trans., Stanford Univ. Press 1990) (1980). In fact, Bourdieu writes that [1]anguage is a body technique. PIERRE BOURDIEU, LANGUAGE AND SYMBOLIC POWER 86 (John B. Thompson ed. & Gino Raymond & Matthew Adamson trans., Harvard Univ. Press 1991) (1982). Thus, we might understand language and tradition as being, in the words of Julia Annas, socially or embodied in various forms of social life. Julia Annas, Maclntyre on Traditions, 18 PHIL. & PUB. A-F. 388, 388-89 (1989) (discussing Alasdair Macntyre's notion of tradition); see Feldman, The Persistence of Power, supra note 5, at 2258-61 (criticizing Habermas's argument that we can separate symbolic reproduction in a lifeworld from material reproduction). 75. James Boyd White writes: [Olur acts of language are actions in the world, not just in our minds. Even when we think we are simply communicating information, or being rigorously and exclusively intellectual, or just talking, we are in fact engaged in performances, in relation to others, that are ethical and political in character and that can be judged as such.

      "abstract": "'Dysphoria' is often used as the most generic word for any kind of negative emotion. It can be better defined as an unmotivated and quasi-ineffable constellation of feelings that convey a nebula of vague sensations and impulses, an uncomfortable feeling characterized by being sorrowful and indignant. The intentional structure that characterizes much of human emotional experience is absent in dysphoria. Emotions are fluxes of intentionality that innervate the flesh and connect it to the world. Dysphoria is an emotional state saturated with a brimming constellation of feelings without any explicit object or target, a state of tension that may lead to spontaneously vigorous outbursts as well as to pale stagnation or emotional depletion. Dysphoria is empty intentionality devoid of the moderating power of language and representation which fragments the person's representations of herself and of others and inducing painful experiences of incoherence and inner emptiness, threatening feeling of uncertainty and inauthenticity in interpersonal relationships, and excruciating sense of insignificance, futility and inanity of life. Dysphoric persons experience their own self as dim and fuzzy, and feel deprived of a defined identity and unable to be steadily involved in a given life project or social role. But it also entails a sense of vitality, although am aimless and explosive one – a desperate vitality. Dysphoria is felt as a disordered, overwhelming flux which is at the same time a disorganizing and compelling source of vitality. Dysphoria is felt as creative and destructive – a vigour that brings life as well as annihilation: a violent spasm that takes control of the body and a power that expresses vitality in touch with the source of all sensations.",

Compulsive drug use may therefore be seen as an attempt to obliterate particular states of mind. In this paper addicts are considered as dangerously addicted to a loss of contact with parts of the mind as they are to a given drug. A splitting off, for example, of loving and nurturing or hateful parts of the personality is effected where these cannot be tolerated by or integrated into a pathological internal constellation. Deficits in early caregiving and environment as well as constitutional factors play a part in this. Addiction is therefore seen as an unconscious attempt to maintain a precarious inner equilibrium by destroying contact with parts of the personality, literally through their drugging. In psychic reality or in phantasy this may be felt as a slicing up or tearing to pieces, and so subjugation of objects. A clinical example will illustrate this idea.",

In thinking about environments for older people, attention is too often given the physical aspects, to the exclusion of the psychological aspects. Objects and people may be in the physical environment of a person of any age without affecting him. Constraints are the limitations which surround a person and prevent him from realizing his potentialities.

Our model explains apparently irrational or biased behaviors in a person. We argue that these actions could result from several rational structures having different goals. Our main example is a model of three agents, \"conscious\", \"unconscious\", and \"body\". Our main result states that, for an agent whose unconscious and conscious goals differ, the unconscious may influence the conscious, either directly or indirectly, via a third agent, the body. This three-agent model describes behaviors such as craving, excessive smoking, or sleepiness, to delay or dismiss a task. One of the main result shows that the unconscious' strategic action crucially depends on whether the conscious' actions are complementary in time. When complementary, and if the conscious is not sensitive to unconscious' messages, the unconscious may drive the conscious towards its goals by blurring physical needs. When not complementary, the unconscious may more easily reach his goal by influencing the conscious, be it directly or indirectly.",

      "title": "A Touching Agent : Integrating Touch in Social Interactions between Human and Embodied Conversational Agent in an Immersive Environment",
      "abstract": "Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are endowed with more and more social and emotional capabilities. They can build rapport with humans by expressing thoughts and emotions through verbal and non-verbal behaviors. However, ECAs often lack the sense of touch, which is an important communicative and emotional capability, in particular in the context of an immersive environment. The sense of touch has been shown to be essential to the social development and general well-being of human beings, from their infancy to adulthood. It is thought to be a facilitator in the establishment of relationships and it is overall considered a very important medium of communication, especially for the communication of emotions. In many languages being touched designates not only physical contact but also being moved by something, feeling something on an emotional level. While in adulthood touch is usually kept for the closest relationships, it is nonetheless present in our daily lives (in greetings for example). We therefore believe that adding touch to the social capabilities of artificial agents would contribute to their ability to build rapport and emotional connections with humans. But to which extent would granting an ECA the ability to touch and be touched enhance its ability to communicate emotions and to build and maintain a social and emotional relationship with a human? To investigate this interrogation, our work focuses on the development of a touching agent: touching in the physical sense as well as the emotional sense. In the context of an immersive environment, our autonomous virtual ECA should be able to perceive and interpret touch, as well as decide how and when to perform it based on the overall interaction and emotional state of its human partner. Our first results are so far promising as to the credibility of such a touching agent.",

He asserts that the phenomena of mental illnesses, including suffering, signal “problems in living” or difficulties in determining the best use of one’s agential powers. The goals of the relationship are to enhance the client’s knowledge of his or her personality, to refine his intentions and sense of responsibility for his “symptoms” and other actions, and to achieve his aims and satisfy his desires, as long as he does not, by his actions, harm others. For the author of this chapter and other clinicians, the experience of phenomena exhibited by persons judged to be mentally ill are, to some extent and sense, apprehended as events that happen, rather than as actions authored by the person as agent. These untoward activities suggest a undesirable organismic condition of a person as agent, a diminution of the agent’s capacity for living a life, the signal of a organismic disorder, a problem with the human organismic equipment for living a life—not solely a problem about the best use of that equipment (as Szasz contends) but a state of ill health and a suffering person in need of treatment.",

In spite\r\n of these difficulties in social interactions, autistic children are\r\n relatively good at interacting with physical objects like toys.\r\n Though their interest and actions are often restricted to specific\r\n aspects, autistic children are generally good at understanding\r\n and manipulating things as physical and mechanistic systems.\r\n This implies that information processing for objects (by\r\n systemizing) and that for people (by empathizing) are quite\r\n independent, both in ontogenetic and phylogenetic meanings.\r\n Robots can be seen as physical systems and/or as human-like\r\n social agents that have “mental states”. So, robots could\r\n provide autistic children with opportunities to experience\r\n interpersonal interactions with social agents through predictable\r\n interactions with physical systems. Based on this idea, we\r\n developed a simple robot, Keepon (Figure), which was\r\n designed to express only attention (by head orientation) and\r\n emotion (by simple body movements), so that autistic children\r\n could intuitively read its “mental states”, not being\r\n overwhelmed by complicated facial expressions, body gestures,\r\n or speech. Keepon is a simple physical system that can express\r\n a variety of social information.For the past several years, we\r\n have been using Keepon as a mediator of social interaction with\r\n autistic children (at the age of two to five) at a day-care center\r\n for children with developmental disorders. Keepon, being telecontrolled\r\n by an operator (researcher or therapist), performed\r\n interactions with the autistic children in their daily therapeutic\r\n environment. The longitudinal interactions showed that the\r\n minimally designed robot worked well as a useful tool for\r\n therapeutic interventions. We analyzed the video data recorded\r\n from Keepon’s subjective viewpoint (of the onboard camera),\r\n and the data was offered to practitioners such as pediatricians\r\n and psychiatrists as well as the parents of the children for\r\n sharing and exchanging the understandings of each child’s\r\ndevelopmental style..",

If nobody still thinks that animal may have a kind of language as humans have, complexity of animal communications have been shown to be much more complex that what had been previously thought: traditions, meta-communication, innovation and abilities to manipulate information through deception, especially among primates, as well as great plasticity in referential processes have been observed. Simple syntaxes and dialogic situations have also been shown among animal communications, but no species studied to date seem able to naturally refer to presentles phenomena. We nevertheless must be cautious. Our intuitions about animal communications are often wrong. Examples of not yet solved problems abond. We can refer to what G. Bateson said about inability of animal to express negation, suggestion by P. Marier that play behaviour is the great analog with human language in animals, or D. Dennett's about the lack of secrecy among vervet monkeys. It seems to be an illusory belief to look for THE great feature of human language, compared with animal communications. It is more fruitful to consider that a number of meaningful differences distinguish language and animal communications. Such a careful and technical position being adopted here had already been defended by British biologist J.B.S. Haldane in the fifties, but it is still the best one.",

      "abstract": "Mirror self-recognition is a key feature of self-awareness. Do we recognize ourselves in the mirror because we remember how we look like, or because the available multisensory stimuli (eg, felt touch and vision of touch) suggest that the mirror reflection is me? Participants saw an unfamiliar face being touched synchronously or asynchronously with their own face, as if they were looking in the mirror. Following synchronous, but not asynchronous, stimulation, and when asked to judge the identity of morphed pictures of the two faces, participants assimilated features of the other's face in the mental representation of their own face. Importantly, the participants' autonomic system responded to a threatening object approaching the other's face, as one would anticipate a person to respond to her own face being threatened. Shared multisensory experiences between self and other can change representations of one's identity and the perceived similarity of others relative to one's self.",

      "abstract": "In the Noble Eight-fold Path the Buddha provided direction on how to live one's life without constantly being caught in conditioned desires and cravings of life, in order to find release from dukkha, or suffering. The Buddha assuredly meant for his teachings to be taken into the day-to-day activities of one's life. The Noble Eight-fold Path (ariya atthakgika magga) is a way to the cessation of suffering by \"rightly\" engaging in ordinary human activities such as speech, action, and livelihood. In addition to these ordinary activities of daily life, the Buddha also spoke to engaging the appropriate attitude, \"right view or understanding (samma ditthi),\"motivation or \"right intention or thought (samma sakkappa),\" and means or meditation practice (vipassanana bhavana) and mindful awareness (sati sampajañña) to achieve this disengagement from conditioned desires and patterns. Furthermore, right view and right intention were then recognized to form together the essence of \"wisdom\" ( pañña) (Williams 1989; Lopez 1995).",

      "abstract": "In advertising, the digital manipulation of the human body involves removing, adding, distorting, replacing, or disfiguring body parts, creating a unique form of schema violation. Such manipulations—termed body disturbance (BD)—are generally designed to attract attention, underscore message content, and inject humor. Based on our lifetime of exposure to the human body’s appearance, properties, and capabilities, our schema is well established, and the disfiguring or distorting of the human body can elicit strong emotional and physiological reactions. This two-part study shows that BD functions similarly to other types of schema violations in terms of its attractive force, rendering such ads as more intriguing, entertaining, and humorous, thus leading to greater eye fixation and elaboration. Yet unlike most schema violations in advertising, BD ads evoke more aversive reactions compared to non-BD ads, resulting in lower ad and brand liking and offering no advantage in terms of greater recall of ad copy, brand logo, brand name, or product type. Further results and implications for advertisers are discussed.",

      "title": "Does Trait Loneliness Predict Rejection of Social Robots?",
      "abstract": "Since chronic loneliness is both a painful individual experience and an increasingly serious social problem, robot companions have emerged as a result of robotization of social work to confront this issue. We foresee that social robots will become pervasive in the near future. Thus, it is crucial to pinpoint the relationship between chronic experiences of loneliness (i.e., trait loneliness) and both anthropomorphism and acceptance of such artificial intelligent agents. Previous research demonstrated that experimentally induced state loneliness increases anthropomorphic inferences about nonhuman agents such as pets. However, in the present research we found that trait (vs. state) loneliness - a permanent personality disposition that is not easily relieved (vs. transitory experiences caused by circumstance, and easily relieved) - reduced participants' anthropomorphic tendencies and acceptance of a social robot (regardless of the form: a picture of the robot, an on-site robot, or direct interaction with the robot). In particular, believing that the robot lacks good \"unique humanness\" traits (i.e., Humble, Thorough, Organized, Broadminded, and Polite) is one reason why dispositionally lonely participants are less likely to anthropomorphize a robot, which further prompts reduced acceptance of it. This finding suggests that unique humanness, exemplifying secondary emotions, is vital, not only in interpersonal contexts, but in establishing connections with social robots.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Awareness of the self and awareness of others are difficult faculties to define. Part of the problem lies in the wide range of abilities that involve various aspects of awareness. Some of the most commonly studied abilities focus on the self-awareness of the individual. These abilities range from the capacity to distinguish self from non-self to the competency to reflect on one's past, present or future condition. Another set of abilities that is relevant to the study of awareness involves the interactions of individuals, and includes behaviours such as deception and empathy. We explore the possibility that species other than humans engage in deception and empathy, and consider the implications of such behaviours for self-awareness and other-awareness in these species. Although examples from a variety of species are provided, many examples come from dolphins and whales. This reflects both the authors’ interest in these animals and the possibility that large-brained creatures are more likely to engage in deliberate deception and/or true empathy.",

It is therefore as inappropriate to talk about human emotions in general in terms of happiness, fear, or anger as it would be to talk about them in terms of liget or song. However, this does not mean that we cannot penetrate into the emotional world of speakers of languages other than our own. Nor does it mean that there cannot be any universal human emotions. Universality of emotions is an open issue which requires further investigation. For this further investigation to be fully productive, it has to be undertaken from a universal, language and culture-independent perspective; and it has to be carried out in a universalist framework that is language and culture-independent. The author proposes for this purpose the \"natural semantic metalanguage\" based on universal (or near-universal) semantic primitives (or near-primitives), developed over two decades by herself and colleagues, and she argues that the use of this metalanguage facilitates such a perspective and offers such a framework.",

      "abstract": "The focus of another person's gaze is an important cue in social interactions, helping us to understand others' intentions, predict their behavior, and allocate our own attention appropriately. The perception of gaze vergence provides information about the distance at which another person is fixating, but has yet to receive much empirical attention. Here, we report that observers display systematic biases when perceiving others' gaze vergence and depth of fixation. Specifically, they perceive others as having convergent gaze and fixating at closer distances, especially when gaze is directed downward or observed under conditions of sensory uncertainty. These biases may reflect the predominance of convergent over divergent gaze in everyday social interactions and implicit knowledge of the physical structure of the environment, in which objects below our line of sight are typically closer. These findings demonstrate the sophistication of social vision, in which our visual perception of others is shaped by statistical regularities, and help to establish the perception of others' gaze vergence and fixation distance as a subject of psychological investigation.

      "abstract": "The internal void or absence is often formulated in terms of the ongoing structural consequences of a profound lack in early maternal care resulting in a deficiency in psychic structure, an area of weak or non-representation. Rather than defining the psychic void solely as a lack of inner development leaving a passively experienced impoverished inner world, this paper highlights the phenomenon of libidinal investment in the original black hole in the early care-taking environment, creating an allegiance to absence, an emotional investment in a state of nothingness that actively impedes psychic growth and shuts down elaboration of the generative unconscious. Because the type of early absence comes about at a time when the difference between self and non-self is still developing, language and other types of communication that clearly define self and other may not be the most useful methods of broaching these early unformulated states. Treating an allegiance to absence requires that the primary attachment, or absence thereof, becomes actualized in the relationship between patient and analyst, the unique manifestations of which bring to life the absence in the here and now where it can be experienced and transformed.",

      "abstract": "Imagine discourse between the arts in which the conventions of what we might call ordinary cognition do not apply, on site of intense lobbying neither tethered by history or cultural integrity, nor, frequently, concerned with social cohesion or communicative norms. It will be discourse in which the categories of an imperial culture are abrogated (however temporarily) by an indigenous one, yet it will undoubtedly also be site of intense colonization. On it, likewise, there will be an appropriation of language on an unprecedented scale. Past experience will play little part. Memory short and episodic, rather than semantic. It primal discourse. Primal in that it the site of first contact. Primal also in that it most often considered be the meeting of primitive culture and an advanced. Primal, likewise, in behavioral sense: in it, the satisfaction of physiological needs tantamount. Indeed, body and mind here are in state of kinetic unrest. This scene of prolonged immat urity, yet ontological and epistemological questions held in private language are encouraged be made public. Here the verbal arts have no canon. Literature has no prevailing cultural standard of merit. Questions of the popular and the high cultural are not naturalized and the fictional and nonfictional carry the same degree of verisimilitude as works of propaganda, rhetoric, and didacticism. In modem times, the West has become the site of this tenacious yet frequently unacknowledged imperial discourse, the discourse between multifarious forms of artistic representation win the attention of children. It in such discourse that the picture book located. 1 Arguing the need for critical language for the discussion of children's picture books, Peter Hunt suggests that to pictures into the same mould as words seems be potentially unproductive, except in terms of establishing conventions, when, of course, it is, by definition, necessary (181). It impossible, however, conventionalize pictorial representation the same degree as linguistic representation. Linguistic systems are mastered painstakingly, piece by piece, referent by referent, word by word. Pictorial systems, by contrast, are mastered all at once; they involve what Flint Schier has called natural generativity and are therefore much less conventional than linguistic systems. Each system, nevertheless, relies on general agreement and on willingness engage in communicative activity: the pictorial system on deep recognitional capacities that link object and its picture, the linguistic system on lexical and syntactical regularities and rules. In the media-saturated culture of the contemporary West, the commonalities and differences of our separate but shared experiences are frequently offered up in televisual or hypertextual format in which what Hunt describes as force set of discursive practices that address and interpellate both adults and children as potential viewers or listeners. The linguistic and the pictorial are frequently experienced as synergistic or polylogic systems bound up in this mass media, media whose intention, according Jean Baudrillard, transcribe the complexity of contemporary life into an ongoing procession of meaningless simulacra, hyperreal, a real without origin or reality (2). Baudrillard's disenchanted vision of postmodernity, articulated most profoundly in the late 1970s and 1980s, produced an interesting ontological metaphor. Disneyland, he claimed, is there conceal the fact that it the 'real' country, all of 'real' America, which Disneyland (just as prisons are there conceal the fact that it the social, in its entirety, in its banal omnipresence, which carceral). Disneyland presented as imaginary in order make us believe that the rest real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation (25). …",

Social relations remain then a problem to be resolved rather than a field to be investigated. However, if embodiment is central to any theory of persons and to inter-personal communication, then the clear-cut distinction between the inside and the outside is blurred and the ‘problem’ of inter-personal communication ultimately resolved. If self and other are made of the same corporeal stuff and are similar despite differences, they can engage one with one another directly, through manifest behavior, without the need to translate some hidden invisible subjectivity into the visible mundane world. Communication begins already on the surface of the expressive face, in the tonality of the voice, in the affective charge of the gaze.",

Two key features of philanthropic activity are often mentioned: Philanthropy is said to involve behaviour that is in some sense, often left rather vague, benevolent or altruistic, involving one-way transfers or gifts of money from donors to recipients; Such disinterested behaviour is often said to involve the donors of largesse identifying with others and thereby forging a sense of their own identity.

Supernormal interpretation is triggered not only by the exceptionality of the perception but also by circumstances. Collective belief tradition connects the supernormal to the margins of social everyday activity: to marginal times and places and to antisocial behaviour such as norm breaches. Perception often combines two or more senses but the existence of supernormal beings in this world is only partial: they are heard but not seen or seen but intangible. People sometimes discuss their unusual perceptions with others but the interpretation may remain open or contradictory. Descriptions of unusual sensations challenge our cultural division of senses to sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. Yet they confirm that only those five are easy to verbalise. Internal sensations such as pain and pressure seem more difficult to explain. The experiences often mix mental and physical feelings and include inability to sense or act. Tradition offers a special vocabulary for certain states caused by supernormal beings. Those words cover the cause of the state but leave room for an individual variety of experience.",

From a linguistic point of view silence is the absence of, or intermission in, communication. Silence can be communicative or noncommunicative. Thus, silence must exist in sign languages as well. Sign languages are based on visual perception and production through movement and sight. Silence must, therefore, be visually perceptible; and, if there is such a thing as visual silence, how does it look? The paper will analyse the topic of silence from a Deaf perspective. The main aspects to be explored are the perception and evaluation of acoustic noise and silence by Deaf people; the conceptualisation of silence in visual languages, such as sign languages; the qualities of visual silence; the meaning of silence as absence of communication (particularly between hearing and Deaf people); social rules for silence; and silencing strategies.\r\n\r\nKeywords: visuality, language, perception, Deaf culture",

The answer seems self-evident: language is for communication. But, for human beings, communicating is never merely a question of conveying information. Often we talk for the sake of talking, or we say the opposite of what we mean, or say something the addressee already knows. A good deal of the information we convey, moreover, is implicit: that is, it is absent from the message itself. Indeed, people speak for all sorts of reasons which have nothing to do with the act of informing: in order, for instance, to emphasize a position of power or to establish a relation of solidarity. The spoken word is not only a tool, but also a means of self-expression, a form of action, a way of asserting one self as a social being, and a locus of pleasure or suffering.",

Similarly, there need not be any behavioral diff erence between two people who happen to walk adjacent to each other and the same people going for a walk together.

      "title": "The Japanese Family: Touch, Intimacy and Feeling",
      "abstract": "In The Japanese Family: Touch, Intimacy and Feeling, Diana Adis Tahhan’s research questions emerge out of a sustained encounter with difference: the fact that expressions of intimacy in Tahhan’s own native Australia (particularly through hugs and kisses) differ from expressions of intimacy in Japan. Tahhan highlights a significant puzzle involving how parenting practices in Japan change as children grow older. Relationships between Japanese parents (particularly mothers) and very young children are rooted in bodily forms of intimacy, such as ‘bodily endearment’, ‘prolonged physical proximity’, and ‘skinship’, often understood as ‘intimacy through touch’ (p. 11). However, these practices seem to cease around age five. Tahhan’s objective is to examine the reasons for this cessation and the ways parent–child intimacy is expressed in the absence of what she calls ‘visible’ types of touch. In elucidating the general absence of physical intimacy within families, Tahhan notes that Japanese people often mobilize nihonjinron-style explications of Japanese uniqueness, specifically through explanatory models like the ideas of ittaikan (feelings of one body), ishin denshin (heart to heart communication), and isshin dōtai (one body and mind), all of which posit particularly Japanese ways of communication that do not require physical or verbal expression (p. 10). People in Japan tend to refer to these modes of communication without explaining how, exactly, non-physical and non-verbal communication is made possible. Tahhan explores throughout the book how typically Japanese practices, like co-sleeping and co-bathing, create a ‘relational space and tangible connection that develops in parent–child relationships that is not just felt in the body’ (p. 11), a concept that Tahhan calls ‘touching at depth’. Her book represents an ambitious project to examine the daily practices that constitute familial intimacy without continued physical contact between family members.",

      "abstract": "Direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, and reputation are important interrelated topics in the evolution of sociality. This non-mathematical review is a summary of each. Direct reciprocity (the positive kind) has a straightforward structure (e.g., “A rewards B, then B rewards A”) but the allocation might differ from the process that enabled it (e.g., whether it is true reciprocity or some form of mutualism). Indirect reciprocity (the positive kind) occurs when person (B) is rewarded by a third party (A) after doing a good deed towards somebody else (C) — with the structure “A observes B help C, therefore A helps B.” Here too, the allocation differs from the process: if there is underlying cognition, then indirect reciprocity is based on some ability to keep track of the reputations of others (to remember that “B helped C”). Reputation is a kind of social impression based on typicality, derived from three channels of experience (direct encounters, bystander observation, and gossip). Although non-human animals cannot gossip verbally, they can eavesdrop on third parties and learn vicariously. This paper ends with a proposal to investigate the topic of social expertise as a model for understanding how animals understand and utilise observed information within their social groups.",

The encounter with the other in all its expressive psycho-corporeal potential allows the emergence of self-states awaiting a listener who is disposed to receive them so that they can take on shape and life. Certain primary unconscious contents emerge only if there is an \"other\" with a potential capacity for polyphonic and polymorphous listening.

      "abstract": "Elucidating the true structure of depression is necessary if we are to advance our understanding and treatment options. Central to the issue of structure is whether depression represents discrete types or occurs on a continuum. Nature almost universally operates on the basis of continuums, whereas human perception favors discrete categories. This reality might be formalized into a 'continuum principle': natural phenomena tend to occur on a continuum, and any instance of hypothesized discreteness requires unassailable proof. Research evidence for discrete types falls far short of this standard, with most evidence supporting a continuum. However, quantitative variation can yield qualitative differences as an emergent property, fostering the appearance of discreteness. Depression as a continuum is best characterized by duration and severity dimensions, with the latter understood in terms of depressive inhibition. In the absence of some degree of cognitive, emotional, social, and physical inhibition, depression should not be diagnosed. Combining the dimensions of duration and severity provides an optimal way to characterize the quantitative and related qualitative aspects of depression and to describe the overall degree of dysfunction. The presence of other symptom types occurs when anxiety, hypomanic/manic, psychotic, and personality continuums interface with the depression continuum.",

Despite their importance, little effort has been devoted to the careful apprehension of feelings. Based on our apprehension of many randomly selected moments of pristine inner experience, we present a preliminary phenomenology of feelings. We begin by observing that often feelings occur as directly experienced phenomena of awareness; however, often no feelings are present in experience, or if they are present, they are too faint to be observed by a process intended to observe them. Feelings range from vague to distinct and sometimes do, but other times do not, include bodily sensations. When bodily sensations are present, there is a wide range of clarity and location of these sensations. Sometimes people experience multiple distinct feelings and sometimes people experience one feeling that is a mix or blend of different feelings. We also discuss what feelings are not, including instances when feelings do not appear to be present, despite evidence suggesting the presence of underlying emotional processes (e.g., behavioral evidence of emotion). These instances of emotion but not feeling lead us to speculate that experiencing feelings is a skill developed over time through an interaction of interpersonal and intrapersonal events.",

By the phrase are gathered together any and all expressions of attitude and opinion which have a predictive character, or represent a readiness to act on the assumption of some probability. There is a blending or linkage between various kinds of predictive assumptions, which makes almost interchangeable the terms used to describe them. Predictive assumptions include expectant attitudes, gestures (significant incipient acts), prejudices, curses, hypotheses, prognoses, reputations, stereotypes, epithets, conceptions of role, definitions of the situation, myths. Let us suggest further the common denominators of these states of mind. Analysis. It would seem that one of the earliest, because inevitable, effects of those modes of mentation which we call imagination, objectification, self-consciousness, foresight, etc., must have been to produce in human beings reactions to their own (or others' communicated) definitions of situations. Men responded to their own ideas or images of the projected future. These reactions would, of course, take the form of positive (accelerative) or negative (avoidance) responses-both attitudes and overt behaviorsaccording as the prospect predicted seemed desirable or undesirable; and the processes of evaluation and reaction toward their own (or others') expectations or curses would be a factor in the fulfillment or nonfulfillment thereof. For present purposes, it was realized that the significant points for distinctions and classifications are whether the predictive assumption is (i) in opposition to, or (2) in accordance with, the wishes of those who are to do the responding. An epithet always has its opposite. A reputation for doing something can always be rephrased as avoidance of something else. A prediction can be couched in negative or positive terms. The actual responses and results may similarly be described negatively or positively,' depending upon the emphasis in one's attention at the time. In either case behavior has occurred. Negative and positive are verbalized relativities. On the biophysical level (the unconscious) there is no negative or positive.2",

      "title": "The co-operative, transformative organization of human action and knowledge",
      "abstract": "Human action is built by actively and simultaneously combining materials with intrinsically different properties into situated contextual configurations where they can mutually elaborate each other to create a whole that is both different from, and greater than, any of its constitutive parts. These resources include many different kinds of lexical and syntactic structures, prosody, gesture, embodied participation frameworks, sequential organization, and different kinds of materials in the environment, including tools created by others that structure local perception. The simultaneous use of different kinds of resources to build single actions has a number of consequences. First, different actors can contribute different kinds of materials that are implicated in the construction of a single action. For example embodied visual displays by hearers operate simultaneously on emerging talk by a speaker so that both the utterance and the turn have intrinsic organization that is both multi-party and multimodal. Someone with aphasia who is unable to produce lexical and syntactic structure can nonetheless contribute crucial prosodic and sequential materials to a local action, while appropriating the lexical contributions of others, and thus become a powerful speaker in conversation, despite catastrophically impoverished language. One effect of this simultaneous, distributed heterogeneity is that frequently the organization of action cannot be easily equated with the activities of single individuals, such as the person speaking at the moment, or with phenomena within a single medium such as talk. Second, subsequent action is frequently built through systematic transformations of the different kinds of materials provided by a prior action. In this process some elements of the prior contextual configuration, such as the encompassing participation framework, may remain unchanged, while others undergo significant modification. A punctual perspective on action, in which separate actions discretely follow one another, thus becomes more complex when action is seen to emerge within an unfolding mosaic of disparate materials and time frames which make possible not only systematic change, but also more enduring frameworks that provide crucial continuity. Third, the distributed, compositional structure of action provides a framework for developing the skills of newcomers within structured collaborative action. Fourth, human tools differ from the tools of other animals in that, like actions in talk, they are built by combining unlike materials into a whole not found in any of the individual parts (for example using a stone, a piece of wood and leather thongs to make an ax). This same combinatorial heterogeneity sits at the heart of human action in interaction, including language use. It creates within the unfolding organization of situated activity itself the distinctive forms of transformative collaborative action in the world, including socially organized perceptual and cognitive structures and the mutual alignment of bodies to each other, which constitutes us as humans.",

      "title": "Lucid dreams: their advantage and disadvantage in the frame of search activity concept",
      "abstract": "Search activity (SA) is the behavioral and mental activity that is oriented to changes of the environment or of the subject's view and approach to the environment according to personal needs without the definite probability forecast of the outcomes of such activity, but with a regular consideration of the outcomes in the process of active behavior. Dream's lucidity (the subject's realization that he/she is dreaming) protects dreamer from awakenings during emotionally disturbing or frustrating dreams, because lucid dreams allow subject to feel separated from the dream events that may cause a feeling of helplessness. Due to such a protection from awakenings that can bring subject back to the frustration in wakefulness, subject can turn in the further sleep to normal non-lucid dreams that are restoring subject's SA in the subsequent wakefulness (activity in the uncertain situation with the feedback between behavior and its outcome). It is the advantage of lucid dreams. Their disadvantage is that due to the separation from the dream events that are in lucid dreams accepted as rationalized dreams, not as real stories where the dreamer acts like in wakefulness, their ability to restore SA is decreased until they are not displaced by the normal non-lucid dreams accepted as real stories.",

The perfect expresses internal relations between processes and clauses (anteriority, backgrounding, causal relations); it refers to transitional processes that have reached or not their final instant, expressing changes of states and resulting states.

The presentation of a piece is not enough; as an artist I feel that the visual observation without a response is worse than a negative reaction. Simple observation alone is a failure to perceive feelings; without reaction, positive or negative, one's feeling for a piece have yet to be touched and perception is soon lost. In my work, I strive to achieve feelings. I release my own, attempting to use visual signs to convey ideas and emotional experiences. Although I enjoy the procedures involved in the production of the piece and even if I am satisfied with the piece, I hesitate to accept the results unless others react. Without a reaction, I question whether I have conveyed my feelings or developed any for the observer, and the possibilities of further involvement are retarded. I am not saying that every art piece should be an intellectual problem revolving around one central theme; rather that in order for my work to be successful, feelings should be generated.",

      "abstract": "Talking to oneself is not heard by anyone but us. So many terms have been used to indicate “inner speech”: inner voice, self-talk, verbal thoughts, etc. This psychic phenomenon refers to the silent production of words in one’s mind. Inner speech plays a central role in human consciousness, providing guidance for the growth of the individual. Sharing Vygotsky’s ideas, a central aspect of his theorizing is that inner speech is developmentally the internalisation of the external dialogues between children and their parents or other caregivers. This process follows four stages of internalization: external dialogue (level 1), private speech (level 2), expanded inner speech (level 3), condensed inner speech (level 4). Children’s private speech represents, indeed, a waystation on the developmental path between external and inner speech. Thus, the socio-cultural tool or symbol system of language, first used for interpersonal communication, is used by the child overtly not for communication with others but for intrapersonal communication and self-guidance. A monitoring deficit in inner speech may result in auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), have in common neurobiological correlates. History and art have shown for a long time the power of this phenomenon as a guide for creativity and growth of society.",

In the ordinary theory of statistical correlation, normal or otherwise, we are always supposed to be dealing with material susceptible of continuous variation, or at least of variation by a considerable number of discontinuous steps.

Certain practical cases arise, however, where either no variation is thinkable at all, or else is not measured or possibly measurable. We may class a number of individuals into deaf and not deaf, blind and not blind, imbecile and not imbecile, without attempting to go further (although gradations of deafness, blindness, and imbecility occur), and demand on the basis of the enumeration a discussion of the association of the three infirmities. Or again the data may be the mortality from some disease with and without the administration of, say, a new antitoxin, the statistics giving number who died to whom antitoxin was administered, number who died to whom antitoxin was not administered; number who did not die to whom antitoxin was not administered, number who did not die to whom antitoxin was administered; and from these data a discussion of the value of the cure is required.

      "abstract": "Foulds (1965) proposed that the classes of psychiatric illness can be described in terms of a continuum of increasing degrees of failure to maintain or establish mutual personal relationships. This concept of all psychiatric illness as an “illness of the person” centres on processes which occur in the mentally ill that interfere with the satisfactory establishment and relative endurance of adequate personal relationships. Foulds conceptualizes these interfering processes as barriers to achieving “personhood”: they may present as signs or symptoms of psychiatric illness or as abnormal degrees of personality traits. Thus, for example, cognitive disorder would make the schizophrenic unable to cope with the demands of interpersonal situations. Similarly, egocentricity would render the psychopath incapable of empathy and with a tendency to treat “others as objects or as organisms than as persons”. In both examples social alienation is inferred, manifested in the first case as withdrawal and in the second case as rejection. It is Foulds' thesis that this incapacity for mutual relations increases along a continuum from normality, through the personality disorders, neurosis, integrated psychosis (melancholics, manics and paranoids) to non-integrated psychosis (the schizophrenics).",

There are less automatic, slightly more developed, versions of emotional empathy described in the literature. The concern was that empathy would somehow undermine theory of mind. Empathy that is not merely emotional empathy involves understanding the state of mind of the other, others' physical or social situation, and their differing goals. Empathy is important for understanding group norms. This is true of most social beings, like chimpanzees and dogs and rats. While the Kuni anecdote is an example of cognitive empathy coupled with a mistake in understanding, experimental work with rats suggests that perhaps they engage in more apt forms of empathy. Other animals may not have the exact kinds of empathy that humans are capable of, but sadly, humans continually fail to engage their empathy.",

Yin/yang describe the polar eects or impacts of phenomena. When viewing any one phenomenon (or comparing two phenomena), yin/yang describe the opposing qualities inherent in it; for example, winter and summer would be the yin/yang, respectively, of the year. Yin• /yang are mutually rooted. Yin/yang are not adversarial, but are complementary qualities in a gestalt. at is to say, the yin aspect and the yang aspect of any one phenomenon will, when put together,form the entire phenomenon, with the combination being more than each component part. Yin/yang is a philosophy of duality. is is the reason why the Chinese term has no \"and\" between yin/yang-the term always expresses the two parts making up the one. In the example above, winter plus summer makes up the whole year. Yin• /yang mutually transform each other-e maximum eect of one quality will be followed by the transition toward the opposing quality. In other words, once the maximum yang aspect has manifest, such as the long days of summer, this will be followed by the transition toward the yin aspect, with the shortening of the days as winter approaches. Yin• /yang mutually wax and wane-e yin/yang aspects are in dynamic equilibrium. As one aspect declines, the other increases to an equal degree. For example, in the cycle of the year, the long days of summer gradually shorten and the nights gradually lengthen as winter approaches. roughout the process, however, the length of each day is a constant 24 hours (the equilibrium), and it is only the relative length of light and darkness that changes (the dynamic).",

It is not just any relation between an action or word and a thing; the list of things which can refer, people, words and concepts, is probably not complete (scenes in more recent movies can refer to scenes in less recent movies); and a complete account would need to speak of cases in which the reference relation seems to involve three terms in a different way from the one already mentioned.

      "abstract": "Physical and physiological experiences greatly differ in the degree to which they become meaningful elements of our narratives. Some experiences, however, are uniquely imbued with the power to evoke, or catalyze, the search for meaningful engagement with the environment. One such area is illness. This study examines differences in meaning-making processes involving commonplace experiences of physical sensations, particularly changes in temperature, and it does so within the uniquely charged context of illness. Semistructured interviews were conducted in two countries (Poland and the US). The data show interesting points of both convergence and divergence on the interpersonal, intergroup, and cross-situational levels. While we are all familiar with the particular physical experiences in question (drafts of air and sitting on a cold, hard surface), they are meaningful, and thus captured in participant narratives, only in some social contexts and/or only in conjunction with certain catalysts (e.g. illness). What is more, in the absence of such meaningful, shared explanatory tools, participants showed confusion as to the source of the illness. This study includes an exploration of the poetic notion of “catching the wolf” (a Polish expression for falling ill after sitting on a cold, hard surface).",

      "title": "Beyond Shallow Models of Emotion",
      "abstract": "There is a huge diversity of definitions of “emotion” some of which are associated with relatively shallow behavioural or measurable criteria or introspectable experiences, for instance use of facial expression, physiological measures, activity of specific regions of the brain, or the experience of bodily changes or desires, such as wanting to run away, or to hurt someone. There are also deeper theories that link emotional states to a variety of mechanisms within an information processing architecture that are not easily observable or measurable, not least because they are components of virtual machines rather than physical or physiological mechanisms. We can compare this with “shallow” definitions of chemical compounds such as salt, sugar, or water, in terms of their appearance and observed behaviours in various test situations, and their definitions in the context of a theory of the architecture of matter which is mostly concerned with postulated sub-atomic entities and and a web of relationships between them which cannot easily be observed, so that theories about them are not easily confirmed or refuted. This paper outlines an approach to the search for deeper explanatory theories of emotions and many other kinds of mental phenomena, which includes an attempt to define the concepts in terms of the underlying information processing architectures and the classes of states and processes that they can support. A serious problem with this programme is the difficulty of finding good constraints on theories, since in general observable facts are consistent with infinitely many explanatory mechanisms. This “position paper” offers as a partial solution the requirement that proposed architectures be capable of having been produced by biological evolution, in addition to being subject to constraints such as implementability in known biological mechanisms, various resource limits (time, memory, energy, etc.) and being able to account for a wide range of human functionality. Within such an architecture-based theory we can distinguish (at least) primary emotions, secondary emotions, and tertiary emotions, and produce a coherent theory which explains a wide range of phenomena and also partly explains the diversity of theories:",

The infant's interest in delineating the boundaries and characteristics of self and mother generalizes to a similar interest in exploring and delineating boundaries and characteristics of other human and animate beings. Active initiative contributes both to external actions and to a child's being active as a creator and manipulator of images and ideas in the inner world of illusion and fantasy. Human qualities are often imaginatively attributed to animals or to inanimate objects in fantasies, in dreams, and in a culture's mythology.",

      "title": "Complementary Actions",
      "abstract": "Human beings come into the world wired for social interaction. At the fourteenth week of gestation, twin fetuses already display interactive movements specifically directed towards their co-twin. Readiness for social interaction is also clearly expressed by the newborn who imitates facial gestures, suggesting that there is a common representation mediating action observation and execution. While actions that are observed and those that are planned seem to be functionally equivalent, it is unclear if the visual representation of an observed action inevitably leads to its motor representation. This is particularly true with regard to complementary actions (from the Latin complementum; i.e. that fills up), a specific class of movements which differ, while interacting, with observed ones. In geometry, angles are defined as complementary if they form a right angle. In art and design, complementary colors are color pairs that, when combined in the right proportions, produce white or black. As a working definition, complementary actions refer here to any form of social interaction wherein two (or more) individuals complete each other’s actions in a balanced way. Successful complementary interactions are founded on the abilities: (1) to simulate another person’s movements; (2) to predict another person’s future action/s; (3) to produce an appropriate congruent/incongruent response that completes the other person’s action/s; and (4) to integrate the predicted effects of one’s own and another person’s actions. It is the neurophysiological mechanism that underlies this process which forms the main theme of this chapter.",

      "abstract": "Procedures for studying isolation vary, and there is no typical laboratory isolation. The degree of contact between the isolated subject and his environment, especially his observers, must be defined in terms of distances, times, limitations of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic inputs, means available to the subject for structuring his isolated existence, and especially his ability or inability to terminate isolation when he wishes. Communication of any kind counteracts the effects of isolation, and when subjects know they are being observed they do not feel truly isolated. If communication or feedback to the subject is distorted, the situation becomes more stressful, and profound feelings of anger and anxiety can be produced. Experimentation in this field yields new data on individual differences, reveals the generally felt need of people for a structured environment, and is of importance in military medicine.",

      "abstract": "Melancholy Ontology, Evental Ethics, and the Lost (m)Other in Howard Barker’s Theatre of Catastrophe:An Analysis of 13 Objects Alireza Fakhrkonandeh (bio) Without a bent for melancholia there is no psyche, only a transition to action or play. —Julia Kristeva, Black Sun1 [The play] is not about life as it is lived at all, but about life as it might be lived, about the thought which is not licensed, and about the abolished unconscious. —Howard Barker, Arguments2 Howard Barker (1946–) creates a tragic world, the avowed arché and telos of which are death. However, far from being tantamount to cessation, nihilistic terminus, or the perfection of life, death comes to designate not just the unknown, but the unknowable. It thus involves a state of nonknowledge that forecloses the normative values of use and exchange, and the orders of meaning and morality.3 As such, death in Barker’s Theatre of Catastrophe features as essentially inscrutable, being at once phenomenon and nonphenomenon, which is to say, neither phenomenologically perceptible nor representable, belonging to the order of enigma, secret, and silence.4 Barker refers to his Art of Theatre as “crucially an art of death” and, endowing it with an ontologically liminal position, locates his theatre on the bank of the river, which serves as the border between the dead and the living.5 He declares tragedy “the labour of death” and characterizes tragic art primarily as an art that promotes the “feeling for death.”6 Resonant with Schopenhauer’s attestation to the pivotal role of death in human life and thought—whereby death is “the real inspiring genius or the Muse of philosophy,” without which “there would [End Page 365] hardly have been any philosophizing”—Barker discerns death as the most fundamental subject of art and philosophy, declaring it “the subject of all philosophy and all theatre.”7 Resonant with the later Freud’s postulation of death as a fundamental drive and ultimate aim of life (“life is a detour to death”)8 and Heidegger’s ontological-existential consideration of death as immanent in human life,9 Barker observes: “Tragedy’s a priori—that we live only to be destroyed by life—renders the notion of wrong decisions meaningless.”10 Indeed, death constitutes a crux around which other aesthetic principles of Barker’s tragic drama—prominent among which are ethical speculation, contradiction, pain, anxiety, loss, and excess—constellate. Notably for present purposes, having defined the objects of “loss” as (rational, utilitarian, commonsensical, and empirical modes of) “knowledge” and “morality,” he proceeds to associate it with melancholy: “The State of Loss describes a state of lost morality, an ethical vacuum, a denial, a rebuke to order, a melancholy and a pain.”11 Relatedly, as is pervasively evident in his theoretical and dramatic works, pain is pivotal to Barker’s tragic work in thematic, dynamic, and aesthetic terms. Pain, as Barker emphasizes, should be perceived as “not disorder but necessity.” Barker recognizes pain as “spiritually necessary” to the “tragic sensibility,”12 which—considering its association with loss, contradiction, complexity, ethical ambiguity, and transgression—fosters “a melancholy beauty,” which serves as the “whole justification for his theatre.”13 More specifically, Barker establishes a firm, yet fraught, relationship between love, pain, and beauty (though death is also intimately bound up with these three), and molds them into a tension-laden manifold. The ensuing statement confirms the point at issue, with Barker defining his Theatre of Catastrophe as “a theatre…which insists on complexity and pain, and the beauty that can only be created from the spectacle of pain. In Catastrophe…lies the possibility of reconstruction.”14 This aesthetics of loss and excess, this poetics of sacrifice, acquires further dimensions when juxtaposed with the crucial questions of nihilism, the death of God, and ontological inadequacy (that is, the poverty of existence and the paucity of possibility of human existence and experience)—questions with which Barker’s characters are obsessed.15 These features drive us inexorably to the question of melancholia in Barker, [End Page 366] but they also constitute focal points of both modernity and its diagnostic critique both in continental philosophy and modernist literature. The melancholic strain in Barker’s drama...",

      "title": "Consciousness: a neural capacity for objectivity, especially pronounced in humans",
      "abstract": "Consciousness tends to be viewed either as subjective experience of sensations and feelings, or as perception and internal representation of objects. This paper argues that neither view sufficiently acknowledges that consciousness may refer to the brain's most adaptive property: its capacity to produce states of objectivity. It is proposed that this capacity relies on multiple sensorimotor networks for internally representing objects and their properties in terms of expectancies, as well as on motivational and motor mechanisms involved in exploration, play, and care for vulnerable living and non-living objects. States of objectivity are associated with a very special phenomenal aspect; the experience that subjective aspects are absent and one is \"just looking\" at the world as it really is and can be. However, these states are normally closely preceded and followed by (and tend to be combined or fused with) sensations and feelings which are caused by activation of sensory and motivational mechanisms. A capacity for objectivity may have evolved in different species and can be conceived as a common basis for other elusive psychological properties such as intelligence, conscience, and esthetic experience; all three linked to crucial behaviors in human evolution such as tool making, cooperation, and art. The brain's pervasive tendency to objectify may be responsible for wrongly equating consciousness with feelings and wrongly opposing it to well-learned or habitual (\"unconscious\") patterns of perception and behavior.",

      "title": "Communication and Cognition in Primate Group Movement",
      "abstract": "We here review the communicative and cognitive processes underpinning collective group movement in animals. Generally, we identify 2 major axes to explain the dynamics of decision making in animal or human groups or aggregations: One describes whether the behavior is largely determined by simple rules such as keeping a specific distance from the neighbor, or whether global information is also factored in. The second axis describes whether or not the individual constituents of the group have overlapping or diverging interests. We then review the available evidence for baboons, which have been particularly well studied, but we also draw from further studies on other nonhuman primate species. Baboons and other nonhuman primates may produce specific signals in the group movement context, such as the notifying behavior of male hamadryas baboons at the departure from the sleeping site, or clear barks that are given by chacma baboons that have lost contact with the group or specific individuals. Such signals can be understood as expressions of specific motivational states of the individuals, but there is no evidence that the subjects intend to alter the knowledge state of the recipients. There is also no evidence for shared intentionality. The cognitive demands that are associated with decision making in the context of group coordination vary with the amount of information and possibly conflicting sources of information that need to be integrated. Thus, selective pressures should favor the use of signals that maintain group cohesion, while recipients should be selected to be able to make the decision that is in their own best interest in light of all the available information.",

This approach to understanding social action, called embodiment, recognizes the body’s corporeality and materiality as well as the social interactions and interpretations with which it is shaped and given meaning (Nettleton and Watson, 1998). The body is a variable in social interaction. For example, having a cold can make us irritable and grumpy, being in shape can compel us to start up a neighbourhood pickup basketball game and having frozen toes at an outdoor football game can force us to retreat to a heated home before the game is over. Socially, we interact differently with children’s bodies or pregnant bodies or bodies belonging to those of a different race, ethnicity, dis/ability or gender.",

The anthropological evidence suggests that there are three patterns of hallucinations: experiences in which hallucinations are rare, brief, and not distressing; hallucinations that are frequent, extended, and distressing; and hallucinations that are frequent but not distressing. The ethnographic evidence also suggests that hallucinations are shaped by learning in at least two ways. People acquire specific representations about mind from their local social world, and people (particularly in spiritual pursuits) are encouraged to train their minds (or focus their attention) in specific ways. These two kinds of learning can affect even perception, this most basic domain of mental experience.

It is a ‘heterology of impulses that register on our bodies’; it is ‘an experience of unrepresentability’.1 It is an emergent ‘zone of indiscernability’ where everything is in flux and meaning is still to be determined.2 Affect is the cumulative intensity that haunts the viewer after the encounter has occurred. It is ‘the change, or variation, that occurs when bodies collide, or come into contact’.3 It ‘arises in the midst of in-between-ness: in the capacities to act and be acted upon’ and to become something different, something other, something new.4 Affect encompasses a variety of sensations, but sensation necessarily precedes affect; both demand that the subject reconfigure his/her habitual modes of thinking and being in new and extensive ways. These modern concepts share an affinity with their early modern cognates senso and affetto terms that underline the psychosomatic vulnerability of the early modern spectator at the very moment when Cartesian dualism was becoming re-articulated as a rationalist project. Senso is defined in the Vocabolario della Crusca as the power of the soul revealing itself through the body.5Affetto, to follow my favourite seventeenth-century definition, is like ‘the heart falling in love’ and speaks of the intense and violent conversion of the soul.6",

For one thing, thinking about affect can change what counts as material and what material might do. I am using word material in psychoanalytic sense to mean the patient's words and behaviour as a whole, in so far as they offer a sort of raw material for interpretations and constructions.1 Affect is part of what an analyst or critic considers in order to build a convincing interpretation (of a lived scene, of a literary or cultural text): one sign that I am performing a good reading or interpreting well is if this reading helps me to understand why I feel a certain way, or why a text makes me feel this way. This is especially case if a feeling is counterintuitive or perverse in sense that it undermines or is simply outside of what I recognize to be my own desires or wishes. Affects or feelings fit psychoanalytic bill perfectly when they are felt to be, as Laplanche and Pontalis put it, somewhat alien ... as far as conscious subject is concerned (246); when they are considered incommensurate with [a subject's] conscious motives (246), they become material for analysis, symptomatic of unconscious wishes, for example, or structures.",

First, it must be more cautious than many examples of the anthropology of character past in taking for granted that character can be generalised to the level of the ‘national’. Second, it should not fall back on a general psychology – whether of temperament or of the strategic actor. Third, it should take the complexity of character – from its embodiment and re‐embodiment in the individual to the plural and often competing and inconsistent collective demands of the formation of character that any given individual in any collective context must face – as its point of departure. Fourth, it should not privilege the homeostasis of the reproduction of character over the dynamics of the alteration of character. Fifth, it should avoid the anthropic as the only or even the chief domain of which judgements of character might be of anthropological interest. All of these requirements can potentially be met in approaching the analysis of character through extrapolating system‐theoretically from the logic of the Bourdieusian field.",

The skill with which a human uses words in speaking has long been a key element in the perception of his or her intelligence. We have a marked tendency to treat people who are articulate as more intelligent than those who are speak poorly. For example, I am startled when a well-spoken ‘customer service representative’ on the telephone is unable to spell psychology or to retain a seven-digit phone number. I am surprised in the opposite direction when someone who speaks English poorly, or with a large proportion of uninterpretable slang, suddenly conveys a subtle and discerning point or quickly fixes a complex problem with my computer software. This language test also has traditionally been used to separate the intellectual ability of humans from that of other animals. Put simply, if other animals can’t understand and generate words or signs in sentencelike combinations, we judge them as less intelligent than humans. The language-based divide that we have constructed between humans and other animals is well defended. During the last 30 years, work suggesting language-related communication in species ranging from chimpanzees to sea lions has attracted a firestorm of criticism that questioned its accuracy, efficacy, and importance. Objections have included claims of outright fraud, inadvertent cuing, and dismissal of results as ‘mere trial-and-error learning’. Perhaps the most common academic complaint is that the language-like productions of nonhumans lack the grammatical constraints and generativity characteristic of human language. Why are humans, certainly academic humans, so intent on distinguishing human language reception and production from the abilities of nonhuman animals? One possibility is that language is the key to a number",

Status is both achieved and ascribed, and the degree to which one or the other contributes more draws the thin line between the real and apparent. To achieve means \"to carry out successfully (accomplish);\" \"to get or attain as a result of exertion (reach),\" or \"to attain a desired end or aim (to become successful).\"2 To ascribe, on the other hand, comes from the restored spelling of the Middle English ascrive, etymologically derives from the Old French. ascrivre, \"to attribute, inscribe,\" and the Latin ascribere \"to write in, to add to in a writing,\" from ad- \"to\" + scribere \"to write.\"3 To ascribe is to refer to a supposed cause, source, or author, and \"suggests an inferring of cause, quality or authorship\" as in the case of \"forged paintings formerly ascribed to masters.\"4 Achievement rightfully bestows an earned \"headship,\" implied in its etymology from the Old.French. achever \"to finish,\" from the phrase à chef (venir) \"at an end, finished,\" the Vulgate Latin *accapare, from the Latin ad caput (venire). Literally, both the Old.French and Latin phrases mean \"to come to a head,\" from the Latin caput \"head.\"5 Ascription is flattery at best; but worse when self-generated and perpetuated. Are vicarious experiences that become \"personal accomplishments,\" casual visits and observations that become \"further training and fellowships,\" comments and editing (even supervisory positions) that metamorphose into \"research and co-authorships\" any different from the fictitious medals of a dictator? Awards beget awards. Those who are thus preceded by reputation may loom \"larger than life.\" Do such giants stand on feet of clay? Our circles are a microcosm of the nation and world around us. Public servants who believe the fictions crafted by themselves and their coutillons continue to claim the right to rule (rather than the obligation to serve). Are we dazzled by the dream? What do we aspire for? Et tu? _________________________ The first meeting of the Asia Pacific Association of Medical Journal Editors (APAME) was held in Seoul, the Republic of Korea last May 4-5, 2008 co-hosted by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office.6 APAME's vision, it was agreed, would be to promote health care through the dissemination of quality health information in the Asia Pacific Region. The association also established the following aims: To upgrade publishing standards of health journals and books, paper-based or electronic; To develop an aggregated indexing system for health articles published in the Asia Pacific Region; and To enhance optimal access to health articles. The development of the Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRIM) and the Global Health Library (GHL) are much-needed efforts to ensure the dissemination of and universal access to reliable health information essential to health development. These efforts will level the playing field for authors, editors, peer reviewers, publishers and subscribers in developing countries, elevating loco-regional research and publishing to the global arena. Following our continued compliance with established standards, we anticipate inclusion of the Philipp J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg in the WPRIM. Through its President Gil M. Vicente, and the Board of Trustees, our Society blazes new trails to lead us beyond the confines of self-directed concerns toward new horizons of hope for our various publics, present and future. Efforts aimed at health-promotion and disease-prevention, side by side with involvement in ecological and environmental concerns may prove to be as, or even more important, than the equally quixotic pursuit of cutting-edge diagnostic and therapeutic advances. What use are these when they are beyond the reach of most? \"When the time of our particular sunset comes, our 'thing,' our accomplishment, won't matter a great deal. But the clarity and concern with which we have loved others will speak with vitality of the great gift of life we have been to each other.\"7 &nbsp",

      "abstract": "Although dogs are almost totally incapable of symbolic behaviour, they can hope, for a dog's behaviour can manifest not only a desire for something but varying degrees of expectation that it will get what it desires; but since they are almost totally incapable of symbolic behaviour, nothing they do can indicate that they both desire something and yet are certain that they will not get it. So the suggestion that dogs entertain idle wishes is, apparently, vacuous, i.e. untestable, or nonsensical. Nonetheless, we can imagine situations in which we would be tempted to say of a dog that it had an idle wish, but since idle wishes so often and typically require language, we should be reluctant to impute it.",

      "abstract": "People use their eyes during social interaction in three primary ways: looking in the direction of the other person's face, often referred to as gaze ; looking away from their partner's face or gaze aversion ; and mutual gaze , in which both interactants look in the direction of the other's face and eye area at the same time. Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior is an important communication tool that has a role in survival, reproduction, and building and maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

      "abstract": "THE INCREASING INTEREST of psychoanalysts in history and of historians in psychoanalysis stems from a mutual need. The former have found it necessary to give greater attention to social and historical influences on the development of personality, while the latter are seeking a better understanding of irrational and unconscious influences on individual and group behavior in history.' On both sides the difficulties are formidable, most psychoanalysts knowing too little history and most historians too little psychoanalysis. Biographers have a special handicap: the subject is dead or, if alive, usually inaccessible to analysis. Material for analysis may be found in his writings, in his recorded speeches and conversations, and in the observations of others; yet this evidence will never suffice, for the primal experiences that produce the basic character traits occur in the earliest years of life and are hidden from the subject himself by repression and other mechanisms of defense. Often they can be uncovered only after months and years of careful work by the subject interacting with a skilled analyst. Another obstacle for the historian is skepticism2-a tendency to regard",

      "abstract": "The new millennium man is living in a completely new context that many people have defined liquid, systemic, global, uncertain about the consequences it could generate. \r\nThis new man will be concerned to face his own context as well as his ancestors did; he will must actively change it and must be changed by it: he has to build his life through it and, together with the others, think about what are the ways they should take to complete their growth.\r\nIn this respect, the quality of the relationship he will be able to maintain with the “out-of-him” will be crucial: at the moment it seems that the fear leads him, i.e. the fear to lose the right street to his personal growth, failing his main task as a man. The relational fragmentation with himself, with the others and with his social and natural behaviour and the lack of plans for the future spread away, making the essential objectives of the human formation farther and harder to be reached. \r\nYet not anything is lost and from the same liquid fragmented context, new proposals and new possibilities appear: actually, often the Answer is not this novelty in itself but what is new is how it is used to interpret the present. So the communitas (community), an ancient form of human aggregation, comes back, with new ideas, new features and new aims.\r\nThis work aims to analyse the issue of community, in particular in its educational meaning and in its possibility to be a mean of growth of the human being where the humanization is an excellent place. The issue, having regard to its complexity has been treated considering two points of view, linked by a common aim. From one side the community has been treated by a theoretical multi-disciplinary point of view giving a definition of communitas that groups together knowledge from psychology, philosophy, politics, sociology, history, pedagogy, etc… through 8 main dimensions (spatial-territorial, temporal-narrative, relational, cultural, educational, socio-political, psychic-spiritual, utopici-eschatological). By the other side it has been analysed from a empirical point of view studying a particular community, the Programa Educativo de Ninos, Ninas y Adolescentes Trabajadores “Alejandro Cussianovich” (educational program for working children and teenagers “Alejandro Cussianovich”) operating in the suburbs of Peru’s capital Lima.\r\nThis research is composed by the collection, analysis and interpretation of some interviews, by a researcher’s diary, written after a period of about one and half year of in situ observation and by the analysis of some institutional documents of the educational program. \r\nIt has been then tried to join the theoretical research to the most practical one with the major aim to underline the central relevance of the community in forming people and to understand whether and how it could answer, for example, to the relational fragmentation problem. In particular, the theoretical research has been used to analyze and interpret data collected in the educational program using the already described 8 dimensions, while the practical research has allowed to find a new dimension (the working-economical one) and some other nuclei (like the family, the cross-culture, the fight, and so on) which must be taken into account when we want to study and/or to promote the community in the territory. \r\nAs a conclusion of this thesis, it has been said that is possible to link community experiences although far one from each other using the conceptual instrument elaborated, and that it would be desirable apply what understood in this research to the educational program work.",

Lo mismo ocurre en el amor que se despliega en la relacion asimetrica entre adulto y bebe durante sus primeros meses de vida.

La perspectiva de segunda persona en psicologia tiene un interes epistemico en la reciprocidad.

Sus hallazgos y descripciones me han permitido observar un tipo de para la reciprocidad que despliegan los adultos en sus encuentros amorosos y asimetricos con los bebes. Una estrategia basada en la creacion y repeticion variada de motivos que da lugar a una musicalidad comunicativa entre los miembros de la diada, y que esta presente tambien, como recurso compositivo, en las artes temporales. Poner en evidencia esta estrategia y mostrar que no desaparece sino que se transforma en el desarrollo motiva este escrito. Este es entonces el plan de este escrito: en la primera parte, comentare la preparacion para la relacion con que cuentan los bebes y las formas mas tempranas de entre adulto y bebe, destacando la asimetria que las caracteriza; presentare luego el concepto de musicalidad comunicativa. En la segunda parte, a partir de este marco conceptual, abordare la descripcion de la repeticion variada de motivos como una estrategia usada por los adultos para favorecer la que hunde sus raiz en las artes temporales. Finalmente, comentare la proyeccion de esta estrategia hacia momentos mas avanzados del desarrollo, cuando el nino juega con maestria con la creacion y repeticion variada de motivos, y la asimetria de la relacion, en estos aspectos, desaparece.",

      "abstract": "Psychology, robotic and virtual agents communities commonly claim that to enable natural interaction to take place within dyad of agents, the dyad must be the siege of dynamical coupling: to give to their partners a feeling of natural interaction, interactants be human, robotic or virtual, must be able to make the dynamic of their behaviour emerge both from their own internal states and from their partner's behaviours. However, most virtual agents engines for interactions model communication as a step by step phenomenon, where pre-scripted signals and corresponding feedbacks alternate. We propose here an agent architecture which generates non-verbal behaviours in live, influenced by both the internal state of the agent and the continuously incoming reaction of its partner. This architecture enables an agent facing either another agent or a human, to emphasise shared behaviours (called Snowball effect), to decrease un-shared behaviours as well as to align dynamically with its partner's behaviour.",

No obstante, el comportamiento que es producto de la evolución, incluido el de otros animales, no está completamente desprovisto de normatividad. Si se define la normatividad como la adhesión a un ideal o estándar, existe amplia evidencia de que los animales tratan a sus relaciones sociales de esta manera. En otras palabras, persiguen valores sociales. En este artículo reviso la evidencia sobre el hecho de que los primates no humanos intentan activamente preservar la armonía dentro de su red social, por ejemplo, reconciliándose después de un conflicto, protestando contra las divisiones desiguales y deteniendo peleas. Al hacerlo, corrigen las desviaciones respecto de un estado ideal. Sumado a ello, y con el fin de prevenir tales desviaciones, muestran autocontrol emocional y resolución anticipada de conflictos. El reconocimiento de la orientación hacia una meta y el carácter normativo del comportamiento social animal nos permite cerrar parcialmente la brecha entre el ‘es’ y el ‘debe’ erigida en relación con el comportamiento moral humano.",

      "title": "‘Pleasures’,'Pains’ and Animal Welfare: Toward a Natural History of Affect",
      "abstract": "Abstract In hedonic theories of motivation, ‘motivational affective states’ (MASs) are typically seen as adaptations which motivate certain types of behaviour, especially in situations where a flexible or learned response is more adaptive than a rigid or reflexive one. MASs can be negative (eg unpleasant feelings of hunger or pain) or positive (eg pleasant feelings associated with eating and playing). Hedonic theories often portray negative and positive MASs as opposite ends of a one-dimensional scale. We suggest that natural selection has favoured negative and positive affect as separate processes to solve two different types of motivational problems. We propose that negative MASs (eg thirst, fear) evolved in response to ‘need situations’ where the fitness benefit of an action has increased, often because the action is needed to cope with a threat to survival or reproductive success. We propose that these negative MASs develop in response to a change in the body (eg dehydration) or the environment (eg the approach of a predator) which creates the need for action, and that negative MASs can become intense and prolonged if the threat to fitness is high and persistent. We propose that positive MASs evolved in ‘opportunity situations ‘ where an action (eg playing, exploring) has become advantageous because the fitness cost of performing it has declined. We propose that these positive MASs occur during, or as a result of, the performance of types of behaviour which are beneficial for fitness at a variety of times, not only when they are required to meet immediate needs; and that the pleasure inherent in the behaviour motivates the animal to perform it when the cost of so doing is sufficiently low. Some behaviour (eg eating) can be motivated by both positive and negative affect. Other behaviour, such as playing or fleeing from a predator, may be motivated largely by positive or negative affect alone. Our hypothesis needs to be tested, but we suggest that it corresponds well to common human experience. The hypothesis provides a basis for predicting whether an aspect of animal management is likely to cause strong and prolonged negative affect (‘suffering’), or to prevent animals from experiencing certain types of pleasure. This distinction is important for bringing animal welfare assessment into line with ethical concerns.",

      "abstract": "Attachment was discussed as metaphor and as process. In any segment of the life span, attachment labels a complex of an individual’s response patterns controlled by cues and consequences from the appearance and behaviors of another. Any response (e.g., orienting, smiling, even crying) cued by, or differential (preference) responding to, that person can index attachment directly; disorganization patterns and/or concomitant emotion effected by interference with those cued-response systems can index attachment indirectly. Behavioral indicators of attachments of children to others are surveyed, with emphasis on crying cued by a mother’s departures, separations, or absences. These might be understood as outcomes of routine discriminated-operant conditionings effected by that mother’s responding to her infant’s crying. Such cued crying has often been an index of a baby’s attachment to its mother. In a conditioning frame, discriminated responding explains drastic diminutions of cued responses denoting attachment in an attachment figure’s absence, and their marked reoccurrence on that figure’s reappearance; and a concept of inner structure underlying attachment that endures in the absence of the attachment figure is gratuitous. Some risks in using single (or very few) attachment indices are explored.",

There are common human aims which arise from biological needs, but this level of need is so general that it spells out no particular solution. Given motive and the capacity to learn, solutions which seem better than previous ones may be devised; or borrowed. They can be borrowed or tried out because the body does not have to change to adopt them, or to pass them on to the next generation. Social transmission is vital for preserving skills and knowledge and for changing them: but it is fatal to any rigid scheme of successive stages in social evolution. The contact of cultures, diffusions of ideas and techniques enable people to jump over intervening stages that others may have had to pass through to reach a skill or state they now hold. Think of reading and writing, or transport by air. It has been suggested that we ought no longer speak of Western medicine but call it cosmopolitan; that too indicates the point that progress through a regular sequence of steps is not necessary to introduce a change. And there are options to reject social introductions which do not exist for measles or the pox—they also spread by contacts between people of different cultures.",

Because it is a play, it is an icon of implicitness, as plays don’t say what they mean in the form of explicit messages from the author to the audience, but communicate implicitly through fictitious events and personages. In this particular play, the main characters demonstrate by means of what they say and do, that, for them, life’s meaning is associated with a longed-for consummation, a life- and purpose- -giving encounter, and that the action of waiting for this provides the focus for all their other actions and intentions, affecting the way they interpret whatever occurs in their world. They are committed to waiting for Godot to arrive; a state of mind encapsulated within the symbolic scenario which is the play. In other words, then, their behaviour chimes with the three defining characteristics of Implicit Religion: commitment, integrating focus, and extensive effects which proceed from an intensive concern, when these occur in circumstances which are not associated with explicit religion of any kind. The tramps themselves never mention God or religion, and the play’s author is recorded as saying ‘If I had meant God I would have said God’. Nevertheless the parabolic shape and the poetic language of the play produce an effect similar to that of religious ritual.",

      "title": "Canine stress in a nutshell — why does it occur, how can it be recognised, and what can be done to alleviate it?",
      "abstract": "Every item that an animal encounters, whether animate or inanimate, is a stimulus. If an animal has had the opportunity to learn to remain relaxed in the presence of that stimulus (to habituate) the stimulus will be one that, for that specific animal, maintains a state of emotional neutrality. Alternatively, if the stimulus initiates any form of emotional response (whether positive or negative in its nature), the stimulus becomes a stressor. As the majority of domestic dogs live in close proximity to human owners in a socially and physically rich and diverse environment, exposure to stressors is an inevitable part of the domestic dog's life. However, the impact of these stressors can be severely detrimental to both the emotional and physical welfare of the dog. These welfare infringements can place considerable constraints on the affected dog's behavioural repertoire and its capacity to behave in a manner that is consistent with an owner's and the general public's expectations. Such failures to meet behavioural expectations is a common factor in requests for the relinquishment and euthanasia of dogs. A previous article provided a general discussion on stress in companion animals; this article examines the prevalence, recognition, avoidance and resolution of stress in dogs.",

      "abstract": "The failure of Transactional and Associative theories to explain the source of a general duty to obey domestic law pushes us to explore other possibilities. In particular, since the moral duty to obey seems to many a relatively basic, natural, nonvoluntary feature of social life, it seems initially promising to suppose that the moral principle that accounts for this duty belongs to that group of principles that specifies our natural moral duties. Natural Duty theories of the duty to obey the law, as we have seen, are those that ground our duty to obey not in who we are (as in Associative accounts) or in what we've done or enjoyed (as in Transactional accounts), but rather either (a) in the moral importance of advancing some impartial moral good or (b) in some moral duty thought to be owed by all persons to all others as moral equals, regardless of roles, relationships, or transactions. Thus, the natural duty in question, from which the duty to obey is to be derived, could be a consequentialist moral duty to promote or maximize the occurrence of some good property or state of affairs – such as happiness (utility, preference satisfaction, etc.), moral perfection, or justice.",

      "title": "Грамматическое изучение перформативов",
      "abstract": "Performative is a sentence naming the action the utterance of this sentence is, e.g. I warn you that it's hot; I must request that you sit down immediately; I can assure you that he is not at home. It was Koschmieder who discovered such sentences in his investigation of present forms in Polish. He named the phenomenon (of word and action), and considered it as nothing but a particular meaning of the present. Austin, unlike Koschmieder, firstly gave the name of performatives to the utterances, which do something, rather than provide a piece of information, e.g. I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow; I give and bequeath my watch to my brother. Right from the start Austin paid few attention to what Koscmieder had stressed, namely to the fact of coincidence of word and action, in other words he paid few attention to the self-nomination, or self-reference of the sentence. First Austin's examples of performatives were utterances changing social or simply intensional relationship. The basic difference between Austin's and Koschmieder's approaches to the same phenomenon resulted in different terms: coincidence - performance. The role of self-nomination in austinian notion of performatives increased when Austin proceeded to build up his theory of speech acts. In this doctrine, as Austin formulated it, every utterance has its explicit performative synonymous which indicates the communicative force of this utterance most clearly. The number and structure of a language speech acts reflects in the number and lexical structure of the verbs that can be used in this language performatively. However, the grammatical form of explicit performative adopted by Austin and now well known as classical performative was arbitrary. It mattered much less than the lexical meaning of performative verb. Austin used this form as a test for performativeness. Performatives were not the object but the main instrument in Austin's theory, so Austin did not consider their grammatical features. The performative analysis borrowed the austinian notion of performative and put it in a quite different framework - that of the generative syntax. Inscribing the highest performative verb, its subject and object in the structure of every sentence neutralized the difference between simple and complex sentences, and enabled to unify and formalize various syntactic rules. But in this kind of analysis, although formal unlike Austin's speech act theory, performatives were an instrument, too. Their grammatical forms were not investigated. It can be supposed that the methodological importance of performatives in so powerful doctrines as that of speech acts and the generative grammar rather than their grammatical peculiarity rendered performatives so popular in linguistics. Vendler was the first who since Koschmieder considered performatives as an object of grammar. His syntactic description of performatives provided grammatical support for Austin's modified taxonomy of speech act verbs. The classical performative form, that of the 1 st pers. sing. act. indic. (simple) present, has always been the focal point of the grammatical investigations in the performative area. It is usually taken for a grammatical criterion of performativeness. However paradoxical it seems, the overestimation of this form is the main obstacle in the way of the grammatical study of performatives. The problem is that the grammatical criterion as an analytic quality can hardly coexist with no less analytic and indisputable criterion of self-nomination. Putting these heterogeneous criteria in the description of performative leads us to the question of how a number of non-classical self-nominating forms are to be identified. Fraser showed in his Hedged perforrnatives that many verbs have so free grammatical conditions for their performative use that can be used performatively even under negation, e.g. I will not point out to you that your face is dirty; I'm not going to add that we are now late. We have two ways of handling with non-classical forms. The first one is to ascribe them performativeness as well as we do it with the classical form. The second way is to deny their performative meaning, but admit their performative effect in several circumstances. The latter position requires formulating rules of how to infer the performative effect from the non-performative meaning and circumstances, that is this way is to divide the semantic area into sentence and utterance, meaning and effect. But in these conditions it is easier to simply eliminate the performative meaning from the grammar, even in the case of classical form, and declare what we name performativeness to be a conversational effect as Bach and Harnish do. If we admit the performative meaning to be grammatical, we have to go out of morphology and take into consideration various minimal syntactic contexts in which this meaning appears.",

Playing dominoes may be seen to give on to relations of friendship which negate and transcend the latter certain categories. The distinct frame of interaction which dominoes ushers in is perhaps most clearly flagged in the way that married couples are firmly separated and not allowed to act as domino team mates.

The data used are mostly extracted from Indonesian proverb books, and ones found in proverbs of other languages. First, the data are classified based on plants or parts of plant possibly concurred. Later, the investigation is directed toward the various possibility the combination might represent. Through careful analysis, it is finally found that the plants or parts of the plants to be combined can be between different plants, parts of the same plants, one plant and its parts, parts and different plants, and parts of different plants. Plants or parts of plants to be combined are perceived as: to have the same quality for representing something hard or impossible to change, something must be committed by both parties, the same destiny to be experienced, or how should someone to behave; the different quality of plants or parts of the plant is used to represent unexpected thing (better or worse) to happen, not easy to give up and always depend on something available, could differentiate between good and bad matters, to use the worse quality things first before the better ones, imbalance competition, ability and sincerity to accept the good and bad aspect of things; one plant or parts of the plant are older (coming out earlier) or younger (coming out later) than the others to represent the difficulties for the older people to change, any occasion follows cause and effect law, the new comers usually should or could not drive out or defeat the natives; and phonological representation to show that sometimes the proverbs are created on the basis of aesthetic achievements instead of merely on metaphorical similarities.",

      "title": "The concept of health – in the history of medicine and in the writings of Hahnemann",
      "abstract": "The number of notions of health is not infinite. In the history of medicine we can only find a number of different conceptions or paradigmatic ideas of health, in a variety of references and combinations. Health was seen as: 1. harmonious balance between principles or entities, 2. result of a struggle against opposing forces, 3. continuous dialectical process, 4. hierarchy of components or functions, 5. potential to perform and to develop, 6. transcendence towards higher levels of being, 7. result of conscious autonomous action, 8. optimal causal functioning, or 9. public task and responsibility. Hahnemann’s view of health, as reflected in his writings, utilized virtually all of these elements. They reappear for instance as: 1. harmonious tuning of the life force, 2. defeat of pathogenetic influences, 3. admittance of aggravations, 4. autocracy of the spirit-like life principle, 5. reference to a higher goal of human existence, 6. perfecting character of medical service, 7. concern about dietetics and life style, 8. utilization of causality and natural science, and 9. appealing to governmental provisions and medical police. These paradigms have been repeatedly recombined and applied. The theory of medicine is the attempt to analyze, adjust, and develop concepts that meet the demand of contemporary medical practice. Medical theory lies between the fields of observable facts and metaphysical convictions. Distinguishing the levels of practice, theory, and metaphysics could allow the open discussion of theoretical issues, such as the concept of health or disease, without raising purely theoretical objections to well-established practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The book has three main topics or concerns. (1) The diversity of the senses. Though all perception represents, the similarity between sense modalities ends there. The senses’ respective representational modes, styles, and structures differ very strongly from each other. (2) The Layering thesis. A single sensory representation usually has more than one content; the perceptual state represents one object or property by representing a more primitive or less ambitious one. Though this “layering” is ubiquitous, its structure and range differs dramatically as between sense modalities, and in some modalities it works unexpectedly: for example, nearly all tactual representation derives from representation of conditions of or in the subject’s own skin, meaning that touch represents, e.g., the texture of a physical object by, and only by, representing stress within the skin; also the tactual layering is remarkably fine-grained and rich. (3) Aspect perception. Besides the intrinsic interest of “perceiving as”—even popular appeal, what with joke ambiguous figures such as the duck-rabbit and the old/young woman—it remains especially mysterious. Nearly all work on it has concerned vision only. But it is crucial for understanding auditory representation, which is one thing that distinguishes hearing from the other senses. Further, the auditory case greatly reinforces the idea that perceiving-as depends on expectations, it severely damages what we had thought was the best further approach to understanding aspect perception, in terms of attention.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Eventive Verbs Of Pie were subdivided into two form/ function categories (albeit all but unmarked by formal differences), namely they were either punctual or durative. (Other terms are encountered for the same concepts.) The distinction hinges on whether the action or event is conceived of as requiring an elapse of time; the membership of a verb in one category or the other is therefore a matter of the meaning of the verb itself: ‘look for’ or ‘travel’ or ‘carve’ are inherently durative; ‘find’ or ‘arrive’ or ‘stab’ are inherently punctual. However, durative events can be conceived of as POINTS in future or past time (Alice traveled in Europe last year, punctual in contradistinction to the durative Alice was traveling in Europe when she met her husband), and punctual notions readily can be used in transferred (figurative) senses which are durative: I’m finding that Howard is possessive is an ordinary kind of sentence, whereas I’m finding a cat under the bed is so odd as to be unprocessable.1",

      "title": "Words' connotations and semantic construals",
      "abstract": "Within a semantic approach to different aspects of language experience language phenomena need to be revealed in their significance. In particular, what should be clarified is\r\nthe common sign-structures of things and words at three different levels: of theoretical form, of actual existence and of socio-cultural values. This will help overcome the main referential illusion of dealing with “existent objects” irrelevant to their significance, or the sign-valued understanding. Respectively, the illusionary semantic study of word-meanings irrespective of\r\ntheir anthropological, social and psychological value-connotations would be avoided. The claim in this paper is that in human experience we have access to actual objects via sensations of physical, material character but we perceive or apprehend these objects as signs.\r\nWithout being a sign, an object is not recognizable, nor communicable or understandable. This means that to become a sign, every single object has to identify some other object or any object like it, or be understood as presented in its specific features in an actual act of communication of any form. Such objects are predicative signs of speech or thought. A thing obtains its reality as an object on the level of cultural values or social functions as a sign-type\r\nwith its own name, meaning and connotations. These connotations as values of meanings (or of values) govern the dynamics of object and word-transformations. As a result of a connotative analysis of word semantics, it may be possible to clarify the general types of word meaning:\r\niconic-metaphorical, object-symbolical and symbolic-allegorical. Finally, it is necessary to extract the main semantic features (or marks), understood as named substantiated qualities like soundness, lightness (darkness), substantiality, formality, corporeality, humanity, etc. in their construal function as words’ iconic etymons. On these grounds – on the grounds of\r\nsign-words’ meanings – it is possible to build lexico-semantic architectonic categorization and systematization of words’ meanings in order to establish a lexico-grammatical system of language and to understand lexico-semantic development of values, transformations of\r\nmeanings and word-formation processes.",

      "title": "Self-Injurers as Loners: The Social Organization of Solitary Deviance",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper we examine the social organization of people who deliberately destroy or damage their own body tissue without suicidal intent. Best and Luckenbill (Citation1982) have proposed two typologies of deviance performed by solitary actors: loners, who lack the regular association with fellow deviants and have no membership in a deviant subculture, and individual deviants, who are the actors and objects of their behaviors, yet socialize with others like them. Based on a convenience sample of 40 in-depth interviews with people who self-cut, burn, brand, scratch, bite, and bone-break, we describe and analyze the way their behaviors correspond to and differ from other forms of individual and loner deviance. Notes 1While people may do a variety of almost unimaginable things to themselves, such as self-amputating, drilling holes into their skulls, intentionally making themselves ill (Munchausen Syndrome), and decorating their bodies in extremely radical ways, these behaviors fall outside of the behaviors clinically associated with the specific syndrome known best at the turn of the twenty-first century as self-injury. We therefore restrict our focus to these practices not arbitrarily, but because they have been traditionally associated together in the medical literature and because they are performed by a constant group of people. In other words, people who intentionally make themselves ill or who cut off their limbs are not the same people who cut or burn themselves, and people who get tattooed or scarified come from a dramatically different etiology than people who self-injure, despite the fact that members of both groups may carve words or designs into themselves. These are different phenomena practiced by different people. 2Suyemoto and Macdonald (1995) also noted that most self-injurers desisted after adolescence. 3We were not permitted to interview participants under the age of 18 without parental consent, which blocked many current self-injurers from the study, as most ceased the behavior by the age of 18, and few under that age revealed their behavior to their parents. In addition, we were blocked from interviewing current students, who were the most frequent volunteers for our sample, and by making people wait a semester to be interviewed, we lost participants who transferred, moved away, or lost their nerve to participate in the research. 4Estimations of participants' cessation come from their own self-reports and may therefore not be completely accurate. 5They thus had many demographic similarities to the population of individuals with eating disorders. 6Some of the self-injurers we interviewed were neither loners nor individual deviants. Out of the 39 people we spoke with, three were clearly not loners because even though they performed the acts on themselves, they cut, branded, burned, or even electro-shocked themselves socially, in the company of one or more friends. Several more knew and spoke with others who self-injured, although their associations with them were deliberately limited. One of our participants was not an individual deviant, because he required the participation of others to perform the act (he and his friends held hands and electro-shocked themselves in a chain off of a generator or an electrical socket). These outliers are not the main focus of this paper, and they are probably rare, so for the main we will not include them in our descriptions and analyses. 7Some popular treatments that came to public attention leading up to or around this time included films such as \"Girl Interrupted,\" \"Nightmare on Elm Street III,\" and \"Secretary,\" television shows with episodes on cutting such as \"ER,\" documentary treatments on The Learning Channel, popular songs such as \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails, \"Crawling\" by Linkin Park, \"Back to the Coast\" by Nikki Sudden, \"Last Resort\" by Papa Roach, and personal revelations from Richey Edwards, the guitarist and songwriter for Manic Street Preachers. See also Egan (Citation1997). 8Some of these included people such as Johnny Depp, Drew Barrymore, Angelina Jolie, Christina Ricci, Fiona Apple, Richey Edwards, Courtney Love, Marilyn Manson, Shirley Manson, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and Princess Diana. 9Hodgson (Citation2004) also talked about people who learned about self-injury from others as a route into the behavior. 10People weaned themselves from self-injury in much the same ways Granfield and Cloud (Citation1999) discussed drug addicts overcoming addiction without treatment. 11One social self-injurer was drawn in by a member of the other gender into a series of coupled sessions, where they cut and licked each others' blood. This was defined as very erotic. 12Rosenthal et al. (1972) found, in contrast, that over half of the 18 participants they studied made their cuts on Friday or Saturday nights, with another peak occurring on Wednesday afternoon. 13Favazza (1996) also noted that some self-injurers do not feel the pain from their body mutilation. 14Out of curiosity he used the knife later to try to cut himself. He wanted to experience the benefits of the self-injury firsthand. Yet, lacking the angst that brought most self-injurers to their behavior, all he got were some scars and a lot of pain. He offers an interesting example of a \"failed cutter.\" 15This sentiment clearly became more widespread, as self-injury diffused through the culture and websites devoted to it sprang up in the early 2000s. In a future work (Adler and Adler, in preparation), we discuss the proliferation of website chatting about self-injury, and the types of interactions and support people offer each other via these anonymous and distant, yet frequent, regular, and often intimate internet relationships and communities. 16Solomon and Farrand (1996) also reported a case where a young woman chose self-injury as an alternative to suicide, considering the former preferable. 17In this, self-injurers resemble the shifts and oscillations of deviants trying unsuccessfully to quit the deviant world but being drawn back in, only to foray out and relapse once again (see Adler and Adler 1983). 18In describing the self-injury of the cutters she studied, Hodgson (2004) also noted that they used non-normative means to appear normal.",

      "abstract": "Externalities, Social Networks, and the Emergence of Norms: A Critical Analysis and Extension of James Coleman’s Theory Karl-Dieter Opp (bio) INTRODUCTION Norms are pervasive in everyday life. They specify what is allowed, prescribed, or prohibited. Many norms are stated explicitly, such as laws, which are often well known. This holds for many paragraphs of the penal code. Most norms, however, are not explicitly formulated, and sometimes we are not even aware of them. For example, when people meet and have a conversation, it is the rule to keep a certain physical distance from each other. This rule is automatically followed, and many are not aware of it. When we encounter a friend, we address him or her in a certain way, we talk about specific themes (and not about others), and say goodbye using certain linguistic expressions. In former times, duels took place according to specific rules. The study of social norms—be they formal or informal—is a central theme of all social sciences. In sociology, for example, a classic study is William Graham Sumner’s Folkways (1906), which provides a detailed description of a great number of norms. [End Page 167] One of the goals of social scientists is to find out what the existing norms in a society are, how they differ among groups, and how they change over time. These are descriptive questions. Another goal is explanation. One wants to know the conditions for the emergence of norms. For example, how can we explain the emergence and change of norms or systems of norms (sometimes called “institutions”) such as table manners, norms at the workplace, or norms about the behavior of men toward women? Another question concerns the explanation of the effects of norms. In answering this question it is assumed that norms have come into being, and the effects of their existence are explored. For example, if tax law is changed so that more income tax must be paid, one may ask about the effects this has on tax evasion. Most existing theories of norms deal with their effects. In this essay, we address the origins of norms. One of the most important theories about norm emergence was proposed by James S. Coleman (1990, chaps. 10 and 11). This theory is widely discussed in the literature (Berger 1998; Braun and Voss 2014, 82–89; Cherkaoui 2007; Elster 2003; Ermakoff 2017, 176–78; Frank 1992, 148–52; Horne 2009; Lüdemann 2000; Opp 2001, 2002, 2015b; Voss 1998, 2000, 2001, 2017). There is further a detailed empirical test of a central proposition of the theory (Piskorski and Gorbatâi 2017). James Coleman (1926–1995), an American sociologist, was one of the most eminent sociologists in the history of the discipline. His work focused on social science theory (with his major work, Foundations of Social Theory, published in 1990). His theoretical approach was what is called today structural (or methodological) individualism. The basic assumption is that societal phenomena (such as revolutions) are brought about by individuals and should therefore be explained by going back to individual action. Coleman’s writings are particularly clear. This is probably due to his strong mathematical orientation and his contributions to mathematical sociology (see, e.g., Coleman 1964). But Coleman was not only a theorist. He conducted important empirical studies as well. An example is the Coleman Report from [End Page 168] 1966, “Equality of Educational Opportunity” in the United States. The sample consisted of more than 650,000 students. There are other theories about norm emergence. I selected Coleman’s theory because it focuses on the most important causes for norms, namely externalities and social relationships, as will be shown below, and because it is the only theory that proposes an elaborate causal model. (I will briefly compare Coleman’s theory with some other theories after the exposition and discussion of Coleman’s theory in the final section.) Nonetheless, the theory is not without fault. I focus in particular on two issues: first, the argument that one of the major factors in Coleman’s theory, namely social relationships, contributes to the emergence of norms only under certain conditions; and second, that Coleman addresses only norms that are consciously created...",

      "abstract": "Contemporary British children;s writers use animal to human transformations to explore human nature and the place of human beings within the universe. Transformation usually fulfills one of six narrative functions. It can be a means of punishment, escape or education, an opportunity for play or as a kind of superpower; sometimes the transformation occurs because the story is a reworking of a myth. This paper concentrates on punishment and escape narratives.\r\n\r\nAlthough the means by which transformation occurs varies between texts, almost all present the animal state as being less satisfactory than the human state. In punishment texts the loss of language and agency, which accompanies a change of form, is seen as a degradation of human nature. In escape narratives the metamorph often chooses to escape into wordlessness. In these stories the loss of human language may be replaces by the acquisition and appreciation of more profound means of communication with animals, nature or other beings.\r\n\r\nThe more fully animal the metamorph becomes, the less his or her experience can be expressed in words, and the more likely it is that the metamorph's own voce will not be heard in the text. The texts which deal with the 'otherness' of transformation most effectively, often render the metamorph silent: to become non-human is to move to a state for which language is no longer adequate.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A growing body of experimental research now demonstrates that neurologically normal individuals associate different taste qualities with design features such as curvature, symmetry, orientation, texture and movement. The form of everything from the food itself through to the curvature of the plateware on which it happens to be served, and from glassware to typeface, not to mention the shapes of/on food product packaging have all been shown to influence people’s taste expectations, and, on occasion, also their taste/food experiences. Although the origins of shape–taste and other form–taste crossmodal correspondences have yet to be fully worked out, it would appear that shape qualities are occasionally elicited directly. However, more often, there may be a metaphorical attempt to translate the temporal qualities of taste sensations into a spatial analogue. At the same time, emotional mediation may sometimes also play a role in the affinity people experience between shape properties and taste. And finally, it should be acknowledged that associative learning of the relation between packaging shapes, glassware shapes, logos, labels and iconic food forms that commonly co-occur with specific taste properties (i.e., in the case of branded food products) may also play an important role in determining the nature of shape–taste correspondences. Ultimately, however, any attempt to use such shape–taste correspondences to nudge people’s behaviour/perception in the real world is made challenging due to the fact that shape properties are associated with multiple qualities, and not just taste.",

      "title": "Mental Modeling in Conceptual Change",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe nature and processes of are problems that are of considerable interest to researchers across several disciplines occupied with developing understandings of science, learners, or cognitive development. Although the problems and methods to address them have different formulations in these areas, there is a long history in each of specifying the beginning and ending states of deep conceptual changes, such as what constitutes the nature of representational changes from Newtonian mechanics to the theory of relativity, or from a naive understanding of physical phenomena to a scientific understanding provided by physics or biology, or from individual early (possibly innate) representational structures to adult community representations of a whole range of phenomena, including of other humans, during processes of cognitive development.A major outstanding problem in all of these areas is the nature of the processes - or mechanisms - through which concepts and conceptual structures change. In part because of similarities in features of conceptual changes across these areas, such as ontological shifts and degrees of incommensurability, some, myself included, have proposed that the same or related processes are at work in the several kinds of conceptual change. Clearly one would expect differences between, for example, the practices used by scientists in constructing new concepts and students learning new (for them) concepts. For one thing scientists have articulated theoretical goals and sophisticated metacognitive strategies while children and students do not. However, in conceptual processes, a significant parallel is that each involves problem solving. One way to think of learning science, for instance, is that students are engaged in (or need to be enticed into) trying to understand the extant scientific conceptualization of a domain. In this process, learning happens when they perceive the inadequacies of their intuitive understandings - at least under certain conditions - and construct representations of the scientific concepts for themselves. The impetus for a problem solving process can arise from many sources: acquiring new information, encountering a puzzling phenomenon, or perceiving an inadequacy in current ways of understanding.Concepts provide a means through which humans make sense of the world. In categorizing experiences we sort phenomena, noting relationships, differences, and interconnections among them. A conceptual structure is a way of systematizing, of putting concepts in relation to one another in at least a semi - or locally - coherent manner. But a conceptual structure is complex and intricate and it is not possible to entertain it in its entirety all at once. Trying to understand new experiences or how a concept relates to others can reveal hereto-fore unnoticed limitations and problems in the representational capabilities of current conceptual structures and even reveal inconsistencies with other parts. Although how reflectively they engage in the process differs, scientists, learners, and developing children all engage in this kind of sense-making which suggests that to a greater or lesser extent conceptual is a reasoned change in view (Karman, 1986).Thinking of conceptual in this way focuses attention on the nature of the reasoning scientists use in solving representational problems. Creating models as systems of inquiry is central in the problem solving practices of scientists. There is a large literature in history and philosophy of science that establishes that processes of constructing and manipulating analogical, visual, and simulative models play central role in episodes of conceptual across the sciences. On the account of conceptual in science I have been developing, reasoning through such models (model-based reasoning) provides a significant means (not necessarily the only means) through which conceptual innovation and occur (See, e. …",

If the disorder is cognitive, it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional, it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential :that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason.

Play can be realized only in contrast tononplay behaviors. The experience of the play state may be sufficient motivation for engaging in play behavior. This definition implies that one ought to distinguish between the experience of play (as a state of being) and play behaviors as they may be observed in play events. Anthropologists Victor Turner and Helen Schwartzman also have noted that the major difficulty in defining and studying play is distinguishing the act from the experience. For example, urban Zulu males engaged in a soccer match or Dani children playing flip-the-stick may be said to be participants in play events. However, while an observer may assume they are experiencing play, it is un likely that this assumption can be verified. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has stated that play is a state of subjective experience because its existence is contingent on there being an awareness of alternatives: “[W]e play when we know we are playing. . . . If we could not conceive of acting by a set of rules that are different from those to which we have learned to adapt, we could not play.” He also has developed the concept of flow, which is related to playfulness.",

      "abstract": "On the basis of characteristics of the exteroceptive reflexes and of the instincts it was shown that instinct behaviour developed from reflex characteristics (local characteristic of the stimuli, pos. and neg. taxis, habituation, conditioning). Most similarities are found between reflex and avoidance instinct behaviour (instincts for excretion, thermoregulation, body care, pain avoidance and safety). Except the safety instinct, all others react on stimuli, characterised by the localisation of the receptors. In the safety instinct the structure of the stimulus becomes important, together with the growing importance of the third dimension. This instinct shows also for the first time a variability of the threshold with spontaneous remaining low for some time after stimulation of the system. Inverse the gain instincts (nutrition, sex and social instinct). Here the threshold falls spontaneously, when stimuli are lacking and raises, when stimuli are found. The spontaneous motor expression of the lowering of the threshold is the appetite behaviour. It means seeking stimuli, which will be gained by elements of the initial and terminal success behaviour. The successfull nutritional and sexual behaviour is stopped by success inhibition, whereas the social instinct remains in the terminal success behaviour with group dynamic hierarchy, with imitating and helping behaviour. Overchanging of the gain instincts provokes avoidance behaviour with constant threshold. The neural systems of most reflexes lie distributed in the spinal cord and brainstem, the ones of the instincts in the limbic part of the brain, the nutrition and sex instinct with a hypothalamic pacemaker. Simultaneous activation of two or many instinct motivation systems result, not comparable with the direct reflex interaction, in interactions on the level of the global interaction, in interactions on the level of the global integration (summation, mixture, synthesis, rest, oscillation, intention) which projects the activity patterns via the motor cortex to the peripheral neurons. There it is completed by the reflexes. The hormonal and vegetative projection instead go directly to the end organs. The motivation is responsible for the subjective experience, the dominating integration with its motor projection for the instinct behaviour.",

Most people are born with the ability to speak physically, but we must learn to speak well and communicate effectively. The ability to speak, listen, and understand verbal and nonverbal meaning is a skill that we develop in many ways. We learn basic communication skills by observing others and modeling behavior based on what we see. However, it is important to point out here that information is useless until it is delivered to someone who needs it or needs it. Thus, communication is the process of, distributing or transmitting information from one person to another or from one place to another. In other words, communication is the process of generating, communicating, and interpreting ideas, facts, opinions and feelings. It is essentially an exchange, a process that is a reciprocal exchange between two or more people.",

Thus it may be motivated by revenge for a past attack, defense against present, or measures of defense against future aggression. Social action is not identical either with the similar actions of many persons or with every action influenced by other persons. Thus, if at the beginning of a shower a number of people on the street put up their umbrellas at the same time, this would not ordinarily be a case of action mutually oriented to that of each other.

      "title": "On the Meaning(s) of Perceived Complexity in the Chemical Senses",
      "abstract": "Complexity is a term that is often invoked by those writing appreciatively about the taste, aroma/bouquet, and/or flavor of food and drink. Typically, the term is used as though everyone knows what is being talked about. Rarely is any explanation given, and the discussion soon moves on to other topics. However, oftentimes it is not at all clear what, exactly, is being referred to. A number of possibilities are outlined here, including physical complexity at the level of individual molecules, at the level of combinations of molecules giving rise to a specific flavor profile (e.g., as in a glass of quality wine or a cup of specialty coffee), at the level of combinations of distinct ingredients/elements (e.g., as when composing a particularly intricate dish in a high-end restaurant, say, or when pairing food with wine), and/or the number of stimuli/steps involved in the process of creation. Of course, people might also be referring to some aspect of their perceptual experience, and one of the intriguing questions in this space concerns the nature of the relationship(s) between these different ways of conceptualizing complexity in the chemical senses. However, given that physical/chemical and perceived complexity so often diverge, we argue that it is the latter notion, or rather inferred complexity, that is the most relevant when it comes to the chemical senses. Finally, we look at the role of expertise and review the evidence suggesting that inferred complexity can emerge either from a unitary taste experience that is judged to be complex, or from a tasting experience having multiple individuable elements.",

      "title": "Seeing illusory body movements in human causal interactions",
      "abstract": "Goal-directed actions entail causality. One person moving his limbs in a certain way causes another person to react, creating a meaningful interaction. For example, seeing a friend throwing a ball towards you causes you to raise your arm to catch it. If humans are sensitive to the causal relation between two individual actions, then one action may provide information about the causal history of a static frame of the other action: the causal actions that generated the posture change over time. The present study examined whether human causal interactions can induce a percept of gradual motion between two distinct postures. The stimuli involved an interactive action, with one actor throwing an object and another actor catching it. The object itself was not presented. On each trial, the thrower was shown first, followed by a brief presentation of the catcher, while the thrower continued his movements in the entire trial. During the brief presentation, the catcher demonstrated either a sudden posture change (two static posture frames) or a gradual posture change with smooth movements (multiple frames). The two actors either showed a meaningful interaction (i.e. they faced each other), or a non-interactive situation (i.e. they faced away), or were presented upside-down. Participants judged whether the catcher showed a sudden or gradual posture change. We found that in the interaction condition, the proportion of trials in which a sudden change was misidentified as a gradual change was significantly higher than in the non-interactive or the inverted conditions. This finding suggests that observers were more likely to perceive illusory gradual motions when body movements were consistent with a causal interpretation of two actors interacting to achieve a common goal. To account for the human results, a Bayesian model was developed that incorporated inferred expectations based on causal actions. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2017",

      "title": "The role of the companion animal veterinary surgeon in behavioural husbandry",
      "abstract": "An American Veterinary Medical Association mission statement regarding the human-animal bond reads, veterinary surgeon's role in the human-animal bond is to maximise the potential of this relationship between people and animals. To fulfil this aim and implicit obligations, as well as enhancing the welfare of both human and animal companion, it is impossible to ignore the emotional and behavioural aspects of this relationship in favour of purely physiological illness and disease. Rather than only addressing defects in the dog-human relationship which have already occurred – the client complains about destruction in the home, urinating indoors or being snappy towards the children for example – the onus is now on all veterinary surgeons to be rather more pro-active in their approach. It must be appreciated that a relationship does not exist merely between a particular pet and members of their family, but also between that animal and all the humans it may happen to come into contact with elsewhere, including those inhabiting veterinary surgeries. The dog which becomes progressively harder to handle in the surgery over time, although frequently labelled as 'difficult', 'aggressive' or simply 'vicious', is in reality simply one whose behavioural needs and emotional welfare have been inadvertently damaged in the process of maintaining physical health or attending to physical disease. On the other hand, a dog who is genuinely pleased to enter a veterinary surgery, and whose behaviour and emotions have been nurtured in the same way as its physical needs, is a tribute to the attending veterinary surgeon as well as its owner.\r\n\r\nAt present, lack of adequate and appropriate behavioural management is routinely compromising much of the treatment vets try to deliver to their patients, both medical and surgical. In the UK, the new Animal Welfare Act (2007) stipulates that all those in contact with an animal have a 'duty of care' towards it, which encompasses both physical and mental needs, health and well being. It is therefore a legal, if not also moral, obligation of veterinary surgeons in the UK to ensure that necessary, effective and humane behavioural management is in place, bearing in mind these requirements. It would however often seem that farm animals have the better deal in this regard. Management systems and environment are routinely considered to have a bearing on the cow, sheep or pig's physical health and the development of disease, and are therefore automatically included in the large animal veterinary surgeon's remit. Not so for the domestic dog, which may be skidding uncomfortably on a fashionable laminate floor, subjected to the impact of noise from a multitude of household gadgets, or contained and punished with electric shock, and yet its small animal veterinary surgeon be completely unaware of its plight. How can we truly say such animals are 'under our care' if this is the case?\r\n\r\nThis poster presentation will summarise some of the very simple means whereby not only appropriate behaviour, but also accompanying emotions, can be generated and maintained in dogs in all veterinary contexts. Using basic knowledge of learning theory and its practical application, the behavioural repertoire of a dog can be manipulated and cared for in such a way as to ensure emotional welfare and maximum success of medical and surgical veterinary interventions. Not only will such care have benefits within the context of the surgery, as a dog's need to become aggressive will be diminished, but veterinary surgeons and nurses will be presented as 'role models' to be emulated by their clients in all aspects of the animal's life. It will help prevent iatrogenic behavioural damage, allow 'best practice' in terms of clinical care, and result in much improved client loyalty and compliance. Above all, the field of behaviour must not be viewed as time-consuming and financially inefficient, only to be tackled on a 'case-by-case' basis. Instead, it must become second nature for any veterinary surgeon to consider both external behaviour and underlying emotions as part of his or her daily clinical repertoire and demonstrate routine care for them. This is the basis of 'behavioural husbandry'.",

      "abstract": "Biological systems exist under circumstances of itreversibility that make them fundamentally different from inanimate matter (distinguishing them for instance as subject to development, damage and death). Individual historical memory and story-telling are capacities useful in coping with this irreversibility. Such mechanisms may for embodied agents contribute to -- or may be even be necessary for -- competence in social intelligence. Structuring historical memories connects to an area of algebra called global semigroup theory, which allows one to construct expressions in ’algebras of time) that can support recording events of fundamental significance to an agent. This may include records of internal changes (e.g. in motivational, goal, emotional, cognitive, body image, perceptual states, knowledge of other entities) as weU as external changes (location, objects or other agents in the environment, physical conditions of local environment) that provide grounding for the representation. The models of change and time selected can be different depending on what is important to the agent. Communicating knowledge of other minds could be modelled in this framework by the passing of algebraic expressions (in a historical ’expanded’ semigroup) which record changes in the life-long learning or experience of another agent. This would correspond to revealing one’s autobiography or, more generally, to telling a story.",

A content analysis was conducted and four key qualities of nonhuman companion animals were identified: 1) presence, 2) continuity and purpose, 3) mutuality and connection, and 4) nature of response. Results suggest that people perceive animals to play an important role in providing emotional support through their presence and tactile experiences, to enhance a sense of purpose after loss, and perceived nonjudgmental acceptance of the griever is highly valued. Additionally, some respondents may feel closer to their loved one through contact with animals associated with them. The type of support perceived from animals overlaps in some ways with human support yet is unique in many ways. Animal support may be especially important for grieving people during pandemic isolation and in the absence of strong social networks.",

      "abstract": "Virtual worlds are getting inhabited by virtual humans. Sometimes they act as (autonomous) embodied conversational agents; sometimes they represent human visitors and reflect (real-time) actions performed by the human visitors or users of the environment. It is not always necessary to represent a full body or any body at all. However, there are also many applications where it can be useful to have an embodied agents that does not only allow verbal interaction, but also interacts through nonverbal means, including a display of emotion. In this paper we survey the main modalities to show emotion in an embodied conversational agent. We argue that for many situations it is more important to have subtle ways of adding nonverbal cues to agent-human interaction than to be able to express some discrete full-blown emotions. We illustrate this with two of our research projects, one on gaze behavior of an embodied conversational agent and one on showing intensities and blends of emotions in facial expressions of an embodied agent.",

      "abstract": "“Do I Need a Contract to Kiss You?”Consent, Incapacitation, and The Ethics of Sex David A. Rubin (bio) Kissing . . . is the sign of taming, of controlling the potential—at least in fantasy—to bite up and ingest the other person. Lips, as it were, are the next thing to teeth, and teeth are great educators. —Adam Phillips, On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored: Psychoanalytic Essays on the Unexamined Life The question, “Do I need a contract to kiss you? ”1 foregrounds contemporary anxieties over the ethics of sex and the law’s relationship to sexuality. At stake is not only the question of consent—What constitutes it? Who can give it? And under what conditions?—but also the role of legal and social systems in the making of psychosexual relations and subjects. Humans are not the only animals to engage in oral eroticism (as chimps and orangutans readily demonstrate), but we are perhaps unique in our capacity to make oral eroticism meaningful—that is, to make it signify. Part of growing up in Western culture involves learning how to kiss, and learning how to make kissing signify. It is well known that children sometimes practice kissing on their hands (autoeroticism), and occasionally with schoolmates of the same or a different gender (alloeroticism). From this point of view, an education in kissing is an education in what bodies can be and can do; what the dominant culture deems acceptable and unacceptable; the shifting and permeable boundaries between self and other; and the discourses and practices of consent. It is, in other words, an education in subjectivity and sociality, their forms and limits, but it is also, [End Page 99] as Adam Phillips suggests in the above epigraph, an education in sociality’s predilections toward violence. I mean “violence” in at least two overlapping senses: first, physical violence, exercised by one person or group upon another; and second, the violence, both literal and figural, the social order enacts on those populations it designates as abject, precarious, and, ultimately, less valuable than others. A contested strain of contemporary queer theory has attempted to register the ways in which sociality constitutes itself through compulsive attempts to excise, in the name of an imagined future and an imaginary child, those figures it posits as outside, and thus antithetical to, the logic of “reproductive futurism”: namely, the queer, the nonnormative, the destitute, the nonproductive, and the nonreproductive.2 It is worth noting in passing, and without collapsing important theoretical distinctions, that other strands of critical inquiry in the interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences have thought about these forms of violence using different terms: in the language of Derridian deconstruction and Spivakian postcolonial critique, eating the other, autoimmunity, or the foreclosure of the native informant; in women of color feminisms and queer of color critique, the marginalization of nonnormatively raced, sexualized, and gendered subjects; in disability studies, the pathologization and stigmatization of people with disabilities.3 Drawing on these traditions of cultural theory, and focusing specifically on the privileged context of student life in the contemporary American university (the audience this essay was originally written for), I will argue in what follows that sexual consent is mediated in complex ways by sociality and its violences. The question I want to pose is: How does sociality incapacitate certain subjects, limiting their capacity to practice freedom? Though readable as a playful jab at the culture of “political correctness” on some college campuses, the question, “Do I need a contract to kiss you?” can also be read as a query about how to minimize unwanted violence through the articulation of an ethical approach to sex. In United States law, the presence or absence of consent defines the difference between consensual sex between adults and rape or sexual assault. Legal practitioners generally distinguish among four forms of consent: verbal consent (saying “yes”), nonverbal consent (as in, giving a nod), informed consent (where a person has all the relevant facts and information to make a reasonable decision), and implied consent.4 The latter is highly controversial, as it is form of consent that is not explicitly granted by a person, but is rather deduced from a person’s action...",

Nevertheless, there may be an animal counterpart, or a behavioral or physiological response that parallels hallucinogenic activity/potency in humans and will be a useful predictor of hallucinogenic potential or abuse liability. Over the years, a variety of tests or models have been explored for the purpose of identifying such agents. Although some of these models have contributed enormously to our understanding of hallucinogenic agents, their mechanism of action, and their structure-activity relationships, a single, all-purpose, reliable animal model remains elusive. The situation is rooted in problems that only now are becoming understood—for example, the confusion associated with the classification of hallucinogenic substances, and the lack of a \"pure\" prototypic hallucinogen. Is it appropriate to lump together in a single class all agents capable of producing a psychotomimetic response? Exactly what constitutes a hallucinogenic/psychotomimetic response in humans? Humans can differentiate the effects of different hallucinogenic agents; some of these differentiating effects may be of a central origin, whereas others may be peripheral in nature.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT They are playing a game. They are playing at not playing a game. If I show them I see they are, I shall break the rules and they will punish me. I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game (Laing, 1971). Members of an organization are supposedly led, but very often they do not see the way. On the contrary, they are exposed to conflicting management signals and caught in double bind situations. Double bind connotes a situation where conflicting messages occur, but where it is vitally important to discern what message is being communicated, and where the individual is unable to comment upon the ambiguity. The result is that the individual is not capable of meta communication and thus incapable of learning about the situation. We presume that the double bind phenomenon can often be found in organizations. In extreme cases this creates ‘double bind organizations’ in which the members are continuously confronted with double bind situations. The members become incapable of exploring the existing models of organizational behaviour. Organizational dynamics emerge ‘behind the back’ of people in the organization. The organization's meaning horizon is narrowed due to a lack of authentic dialogue. Attempted changes of organizational direction are experienced as just another double bind, and attempted changes of the double bind patterns become victims of the logic they attempt to alter. In such cases, the organization could be said to be characterized by a form of institutionalized learning incompetence. Understanding the double bind phenomenon should be seen as being important for managing organizations in general, and for the change and the management of change in particular.",

Rather than an opportunity for structure building, failure to achieve an empathic response intensifies the driven quality of self-pity, clinging behavior, and manipulation. Self-pity, dependence, and manipulation do not represent a retreat from forbidden sexual and aggressive wishes. Freud's work emphasized the negative transference to the analyst of what was hidden from and abhorrent to the patient. It is this which makes it possible to understand the meaning of self-pity, dependence, and exploitation not as defenses against aggressive and sexual striving but as a legitimate expression of needs and wishes for selfobject experience vital to growth.",

      "abstract": "Abstract How the Child with Autism May See the World Differently. In this chapter, we will begin to explore the third and final area of autistic learning disabilities. These are the learning disabilities that result from how children with autism take in information about the world differently from other children. From the point of view of diagnostic symptoms, these disabilities in learning stem from processing sensory information differently, and apparently extracting and processing meaning differently. Children with autistic spectrum disorders may over- or under-respond to different sorts of sensory stimuli: A child with autism may hear something and ignore it; or he may hear something chat is so apparently intense that he covers his ears with his hands or flaps his arms and vocalizes in a frantic perturbed fashion. A child with autism may see something (or someone) and seemingly “look right through” what he sees; or he may seize the object with one hand, hold it to the periphery of his vision with a strong vertical orientation, and stare fixedly at it out of the corners of his eyes, while rotating it slightly back and forth. A child with autism may assiduously ignore strangers, but selectively approach anyone with fluffy hair and grab the hair and smell it.",

      "abstract": "Linguistics and Evolution foregrounds the twin and intertwined temporal dimensions of phylogeny and ontogeny in order to explain how a living being becomes a languaging living being. Exploring the full extensions of this double dimension of time requires: (i) an examination of a living being in its appropriate setting, which for human beings ever was and always is the social, languaging setting; (ii) an understanding of the mosaic-like development over time of languaging abilities in both the species and the individual so that it has now become a connected trait; and (iii) an appreciation of the psychological depth and complexity of languaging behaviors and effects in the mature languager. This is to say that, in a developmental systems linguistics, languaging is given a kind of cognitive breathing room not found in the last fifty years of formalist theorizing. A developmental systems linguistics is furthermore grounded in the sense that aspiring languagers and mature languagers alike have two feet on the ground (or are on all fours or in some conveyance) as they move around in their world, acting on it and being affected – in their being, knowing and doing – by the consequences of their actions.",

      "title": "On Experiential Loneliness",
      "abstract": "Presumably, everyone has, at some point in their lives, felt lonely. Loneliness is, in that particular sense, omnipresent. What it feels like to be lonely can, however, vary significantly. Loneliness is far from being a homogeneous phenomenon. Different kinds of loneliness need to be distinguished, considering its causes, contexts, a person's capacities to cope with it, and many other factors. This paper introduces the notion of a specific kind of loneliness: experiential loneliness. Experiential loneliness, it will be argued, consists in particular ways of experiencing the world, oneself, and others. Although feelings of being lonely in one way or another can emanate from one's experience of the world being structured in a particular manner, such kinds of loneliness need not-at least, not always and the whole time-lead to emotional feelings that are concerned with one's loneliness or the lack of meaningful social relationship. Loneliness can give rise to quite different emotional feelings that sometimes even cover up their provenience from underlying experiential loneliness. The notion of experiential loneliness, it is suggested, helps to tie back certain styles of thinking, desires, feelings, and behaviors to contexts of loneliness. Moreover, it will be argued that the notion can also elucidate the development of feelings of being lonely in contexts in which others are not only around but also available. To develop and enrich the notion of experiential loneliness as well as to exemplify its usefulness, a closer look will be taken at the case of borderline personality disorder, a condition in which sufferers are often plagued by loneliness.",

      "abstract": "Discusses two psychopathological phenomena of the Malay culture, Amok and Lattah. Amok refers to the horrific, unexpected, murderous attack in the tropical rest of the kampong (village). Lattah refers to the note gaie in the daily contact between a family and its household staff. It is contended that study of these psychic abnormalities is of great interest because of their specific nature and symptoms (showing some characteristic qualities of the Malay race) and because a deeper insight into those psychic aberrations of primitive people, having a less complicated psychic structure, is of great value to the study of the psychoses of cultured races. Amok is considered an acute, mostly infectious delirium, while the peculiar psychic nature of the Malay is responsible for the symptoms which render this syndrome entirely different from similar ones in Europe. The symptoms of Lattah are described as in consequence of a fright or some other sudden emotion; the startled patient screams, after which she repeats everything that is said, called out or done in front of her (echolally and echopraxis); besides she does everything she is told to do, including actions entirely adverse to her habits and inclinations (automatism by command). These compulsory symptoms can be kept up as long as one wishes by using the element of fright again and again; they disappear as soon as the patient is spoken to quietly and soothed.

An abnormal environment is one to which we are not optimally adapted but can accommodate through the development of coping strategies. These abnormal environments can be 'exceptional', e.g., polar base, space station, submarine, prison, intensive care unit, isolation ward etc.; 'extreme', marked by more intense environmental stimuli and a real or perceived lack of control over the situation, e.g., surviving at sea in a life-raft, harsh prison camp etc.; or 'tortuous', when specific environmental stimuli are used deliberately against a person in an attempt to undermine his will or resistance. The main factors in an abnormal environment are: psychological (isolation, sensory deprivation, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, temporal disorientation); psychophysiological (thermal, stress positions), and psychosocial (cultural humiliation, sexual degradation). Each single factor may not be considered tortuous, however, if deliberately structured into a systemic cluster may constitute torture under legal definition. The individual experience of extremis can be pathogenic or salutogenic and attempts are being made to capitalise on these positive experiences whilst ameliorating the more negative aspects of living in an abnormal environment.",

It turns even out that relations of collaboration and valuing are more important than those of aggression and predation. I will outline the ways organisms select and value specific items in their network of living and non-living entities. No organism eats everything; all organisms prefer certain foods, companions, and habitats. Relations between organisms are established on the basis of communication, exchange of signs, actions and goods, through mutual learning processes on all levels of life. Micro, meso and macro organisms participate in this process of valuing and communication. Animals and plants therefore show features that were traditionally attributed only to humans, like selfless assistance. The usual distinction between humans and other living beings on the basis of human’s sensitivity for altruism, language and values crumbles down due to the circumstance that also non-human living beings are prone to selfless assistance, communication and valuing.",

      "abstract": "Eye contact between two people often serves as a channel of nonverbal communication. It may signal aggresive or dominating intent, as in a staredown, or it may convey an impression of close bonding, intimacy, or a request for aid, depending on how actors define the situation. Some theories of nonverbal communication assume that mutual gaze is physiologically arousing and that this arousal accounts in part for the efficacy of eye contact as a communication channel. The first experiment reported here shows that mutual gaze does indeed cause more physiological arousal than control conditions of nonmutual gaze. The second experiment demonstrates that an actor can communicate with another person by gazing in such a manner that he can manipulate that person's physiology. A third experiment demonstrates that a subject's response to a mutual gaze is a good predictor of his or her degree of influence (dominance) in subsequent social interaction. These results emphasize the rapid emergence of status differentiation in face-to-face interaction between strangers.",

More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that in romantic relationships, construals tend to be abstract in the case of physically distal partners and concrete in the case of physically proximal partners. This presumes that physical accessibility permits concrete contact between lovers, and that denied physical access tends to render romances abstract. For example, partners who are side by side are aware of and use their sensory capacities. They can touch, feel, see and smell the person they are with, rendering their romance concrete. Furthermore, such romances can also be more specific or detail oriented concerning joint activities. Whether it is physical or lifestyle informadon, couples in proximal romances simply 'know' more information about each other. But what kind of closeness can link two lovers who are physically distant? With the lack of availability of sense perception, distal relations rely on a memory of the physical characteristics of the partner. Thus, the",

Paul Homke investigated the face of he listener in face-to-face communication, specifically blinking and brow movements. He found that long blinks are used as a communicative signal of understanding, conveying “I’ve received enough information for current purposes, please go on”. Listeners’ furrowed brow, on the other hand, was shown to signal a lack of understanding, conveying “I’ve not received enough information for current purposes, please clarify”. Closing the eyelids by blinking (as if having seen enough) and furrowing the eyebrows (as if not seeing clearly) point to a metaphorical use of the muscles surrounding the eyes, signaling sufficient or insufficient understanding. Thus, in everyday social interaction, it is not only the eyes themselves, but crucially, the regions surrounding the eyes, that serve as windows to the mind.",

      "abstract": "Players in Axelrod and Hamilton's model of cooperation were not only in a Prisoner's Dilemma, but by definition, they were also trapped in a dyad. But animals are rarely so restricted and even the option to interact with third parties allows individuals to escape from the Prisoner's Dilemma into a much more interesting and varied world of cooperation, from the apparently rare 'parcelling' to the widespread phenomenon of market effects. Our understanding of by-product mutualism, pseudo-reciprocity and the snowdrift game is also enriched by thinking 'beyond the dyad'. The concepts of by-product mutualism and pseudo-reciprocity force us to think again about our basic definitions of cooperative behaviour (behaviour by a single individual) and cooperation (the outcome of an interaction between two or more individuals). Reciprocity is surprisingly rare outside of humans, even among large-brained 'intelligent' birds and mammals. Are humans unique in having extensive cooperative interactions among non-kin and an integrated cognitive system for mediating reciprocity? Perhaps, but our best chance for finding a similar phenomenon may be in delphinids, which also live in large societies with extensive cooperative interactions among non-relatives. A system of nested male alliances in bottlenose dolphins illustrates the potential and difficulties of finding a complex system of cooperation close to our own.",

      "abstract": "From the follow-up clinical material in a medical-educational institution about an adolescent affected by autosomal trisomy and showing signs of autistic withdrawal, I propose to relate several psychotherapeutic sessions in order to trace the clinical elements that allowed Leo to gradually reconstruct his body image and his sense of existence, and to discover a sense of alterity. As such the naming of sensorial experiences during sessions was able to strengthen Leo’s consciousness of his own existence. Previously he would go into autistic withdrawals for his own survival, where the separation of his thoughts kept him from reconnecting with his physical experiences. His stages of destruction (self-abuse and violence) can be understood as attempts at differentiation (rather than as a refusal of relationships) at times when a recently recovered emotional intensity overwhelmed him and his stimulus barrier was still weak. Emotional intensity thus plunged him into uncontrollable anxiety over the solidity of his body, which could be assuaged by slowing down gestures and movements, and through therapeutic conversations. This expanded time favored the sensorial integration of his feelings until an image of his body could be constructed. Thus he could slowly experience relationships with others, at first by putting himself in others’ shoes with interchangeable identifications, and then by allowing himself to be aware of his own existence without isolating himself from others. Subsequently, he was able to relive, through the transference of childhood trauma, the experience of feeling monstrous and dangerous during his first year, as his parents coped with the shock of having and seeing their baby with a disability. Finally, at the end of the sessions he was able to let go of an unmanageable sense of responsibility to repair his parents’ narcissistic wounds so that he could rediscover his place among his peers and his trust in adults, to feel safe and begin steps toward further growth.",

      "abstract": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self Roberta Culbertson (bio) Memory and Silence Naive public conceptions of memory, and the attendant assumption that memory takes certain forms and not others, contribute to a curious circumstance surrounding the victimized survivor of violence. The survivor most often, nearly invariably, becomes silent about his victimization, though the experience nevertheless in every case remains somehow fundamental to his existence, and to his unfolding or enfolded conception of himself. This silence is an internal one in which the victim attempts to suppress what is recalled (so as not to relive the victimization countless times), or finds it repressed by some part of himself which functions as a stranger, hiding self from the self’s experience according to unfathomable criteria and requirements. It is external as well: the victim does not tell what she recalls, in part because others do not seem to hear what is said, partly out of a conviction that she will not be believed, and more basically because she simply cannot make the leap to words: “If you were not there, it is difficult to describe or say how it was. It sounds very, very, very. . . . I don’t know if there is [a] word to describe the nightmare one go through . . . how men function under such a stress is one thing, and then how you communicate and express [to] somebody who never knew that such a degree of brutality [is] existing seems like a fantasy.” 1 Yet despite this silence, the momentous nature of threats and harm to the body dictates that violence and trauma nevertheless leave the survivor preoccupied with the memory of it, which itself seems both absent and entirely too present. Most disturbingly, bits of memory, flashing like clipped pieces of film held to the light, appear unbidden and in surprising ways, as if possessed of a life independent of will or consciousness. These undeniable presences nevertheless have an aura of unbelievability: though presenting themselves as clearly past, real, and fully embodied, they appear in nonnarrative forms that seem to meet no standard test for truth or comprehensibility. Survivor writings make it clear that to be a survivor of one’s violation [End Page 169] is precisely this: to live with the paradox of silence and the present but unreachable force of memory, and a concomitant need to tell what seems untellable. 2 The paradox is based in more than simply the difficulty of reporting events that listeners would rather not hear or believe, or which are too different to be grasped. It is the paradox of a known and felt truth that unfortunately obeys the logic of dreams rather than of speech and so seems as unreachable, as other, as these, and as difficult to communicate and interpret, even to oneself. It is a paradox of the distance of one’s own experience. No experience is more one’s own than harm to one’s own skin, but none is more locked within that skin, played out within it in actions other than words, in patterns of consciousness below the everyday and the constructions of language. Trapped there, the violation seems to continue in a reverberating present that belies the supposed linearity of time and the possibility of endings. It at once has a certain pastness, is a sort of “memory-knowledge” as Mary Warnock would call it, and is not past, not “memory”—that is, a personal, narrated account of something completed, locatable in time—at all. Perhaps it is not even remembered, but only felt as a presence, or perhaps it shapes current events according to its template, itself unrecognized. 3 The demands of narrative for their part operate in fact as cultural silencers to this sort of memory, descending immediately upon an experience to shape notions of legitimate memory, and silencing the sort of proto-memory described. We lose sight of the body’s own recall of its response to threat and pain, and of the ways in which it “speaks” this pain, because this wordless language is unintelligible to one whose body is not similarly affected, and because without words the experience has a certain shadowy quality, a paradoxical...",

      "abstract": "The individual inclination to lead an autonomous life until death is associated with requirements that may be of physiological, psychosocial and environmental nature. We aim to describe a conceptual oro-facial health model with an emphasis on oro-facial function, taking the domains of quality of life and patient-centred values into account. In the context of oro-facial function, the requirements of life are met when the oro-facial system is in a fit state. 'Fitness of the oro-facial system, that is oro-facial health, is a state that is characterised by an absence of, or positive coping with physical disease, mental disease, pain and negative environmental and social factors. It will allow natural oro-facial functions such as sensing, tasting, touching, biting, chewing, swallowing, speaking, yawning, kissing and facial expression'. In the presented conceptual model of oro-facial health, it is postulated that each individual has present and future potentials related to biological prerequisites and resources that are developed by an individual through the course of life. These potentials form the oro-facial functional capacity. When the individual potentials together do not meet the requirements of life anymore, dysfunction and disease result. The oro-facial system is subject to physiological ageing processes, which will inevitably lead to a decrease in the oro-facial functional capacity. Furthermore, comorbid medical conditions might hamper oro-facial function and, alongside with the ageing process, may lead to a state of oral hypofunction. Currently, there is a lack of widespread, validated, easy-to-use instruments that help to distinguish between states of oro-facial fitness as opposed to oral hypofunction. Clearly, research is needed to establish adequate, validated instruments alongside with functional rehabilitation procedures.",

      "title": "Visual perception of surprising materials in dynamic scenes",
      "abstract": "Many objects that we encounter have material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft and jelly dessert is wobbly. Over a life time of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object9s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes pulled towards the native motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in reaction time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance. Understanding how high-level expectations are integrated with incoming sensory evidence is an essential step towards understanding how the human visual system accomplishes material perception.",

      "title": "Effects of Happiness on Mental Health",
      "abstract": "The concept of mental health comprised to the health conditions of people without suffering any mental or psychological problem such as stress, depression, anxiety and other form of psychic disorders. In this regard it can be said that no one is free from and psychological, psycho-physical and psycho-social disorders from which we can derive that no one mentally healthy. But the concept of mental health defined free from the disorders those are prolonged and panic in nature. As the concept of mental health is subjective in nature, it varies from person to person. Besides free from the disorders, a person should pose some of the other positive characteristics to deal with the society effectively. Marry (1958) stated that, a person can be considered mentally healthy with the following characteristics such as (a) Positive attitudes toward himself/herself; (b) Realization of own potentialities through action; (c); Unification of in personality; (d) Degree of independence of social influences; (e) observations of the world around; and (f) Positive adapts to everyday life. Briefly, it can be said that positive mental health of the person make able to an individual to stand on his own two feet without making undue demands or impositions of others. In this regard the role of happiness in day to day life can make the individual more skilled to fight with different mental disorders. The present article is intended to find out the effects of happiness in day to day life in a social situation to deal with different mental disorders to make the individual mentally healthy and prosperous in life.",

In Order to give a brief outline of the intimate relation between aesthetical experience and human language this paper argues (1.) that language is not primarily a means of designation, expression or communication but rather an activity of organization of our experience, of production of sense, of constitutive mediation of our world or worlds, and (2.) that aesthetical objects do not cover the whole range of aesthetical relations, that subject-object aesthetical relations do not depend on inter-personal aesthetic relations and that subject-object aesthetical relations play an organizational role in several ways similar to that of language and necessarily interwoven with it.",

      "title": "THE NON-VERBAL DIMENSIONS OF PRESENTATION",
      "abstract": "Actions Speak Louder than Words. Nonverbal communication is the process by which nonverbal behaviors are used, either single or in combination with verbal behaviors, in the exchange and interpretation of messages within a given situation or context. Philip Lewis, famous writer on Communication techniques says, “Most of us speak at least one oral language, but everyone speaks a nonverbal language”. Communication analysts tend to agree that perhaps most of the expression of emotional and motivational states occur on nonverbal levels and are communicable by facial and paralinguistic cues.” Probably more feelings and intentions are communicated nonverbally than through all the verbal methods combined. Although we use two different mediums to convey messages when we communicate, it is difficult to distinguish our words from our nonverbal cues. Both are intimately woven into our messages and at as complements to one another. However, nonverbal communication is so inextricably bound up with verbal aspects of the communication process that we can only separate artificially. “To leave the impression that you someone’s voice, appearance, facial expression, other distance he stands from you, independently of one another, is to leave you with a distorted impression of the process.” Mehrabian has identified three dimensions of human feelings and attitudes often communicated more effectively through nonverbal cues: Like-Dislike; Potency or Status (Power); and Responsiveness. Only by observing posture, facial expressions, and use of the space around them, an observer can develop a fairly accurate interpretation of how comfortable two people are with each other and which person has power over the other.

Individuals who experience presence may feel as if they are located in or connected with others in the medium as if it were real life. People may experience different types of presence, including social presence, spatial presence, and self‐presence. Social presence refers to a sense of interacting with another entity (person or virtual reality character), fostering feelings of togetherness. Spatial presence positions individuals within the mediated environment as though they were actually there. Finally, self‐presence occurs when an individual assumes the role of the character or avatar as if it were themselves. Although the term presence is most frequently used for virtual reality and video games, presence or immersion can be experienced across a wide variety of mediums such as books and movies.",

      "abstract": "A large number of retarded individuals exhibit repetitive and rhythmical movements of a highly stereotyped character. Common forms of these behaviors include body rocking, head nodding, hand waving, head banging and so on. Such behaviors are distinguished by their apparently maladaptive and excessive nature. The frequency of these bizarre responses in negatively correlated with measured intelligence. Stereotyped movements usually have their onsets early in the life of the individual and, in many cases, appear to have become functionally autonous. A variety of theories have been proposed to explain the onset and maintenance of stereotyped movements. None can be accepted to the exclusion of others and all have some empirical support. Problems of measurement are particularly difficult ones in this area. Of the various methods devised to suppress stereotyped movements, those based on principles of learning seem to be the most popular. However, generalization and durability of suppression effects generally have not been dealt with adequately. Much less attention has been paid to ecological analyses of the natural environments in which individuals exhibits stereotypies. A case can be made that our knowledge about the initiating conditions for these behaviors and subsequent effects on the natural environment is far less than perfect. A number of research directions are suggested.",

      "title": "Prosocial Behavior",
      "abstract": "Social psychologists invented the concept of prosocial behavior to characterize a range of voluntary actions that benefit the welfare of others. Because prosocial behavior is socially defined, its specific nature may differ across societies or by situations. For example, the widespread norm, “Thou shall not kill,” does not apply on the battlefield where killing may be rewarded with praise and medals. Prosocial behavior is consistent with social norms and provides a convenient antonym for antisocial behavior, or non‐normative behaviors such as crime and most forms of aggression. Helping is a prosocial subtype and refers to any behavior that has positive consequences for another. The helper's motivation may be altruistic or egoistic. Altruism is a special form of helping. The altruist is motivated by the ultimate goal of improving another's well‐being regardless of possible personal costs. Although the altruist may garner rewards in the act of helping, this does not preclude the altruistic intent. In contrast, egoistic responses are self‐serving and motivated by the desire to improve one's own welfare. The connection between altruism and prosocial behavior varies. Prosocial behavior will not always be altruistically motivated, and altruistic motivation will not always generate prosocial behavior (Batson 1991).",

Other accounts involve the experiencer obtaining knowledge by other means, without the assistance of a non-human supernatural being. While some cases involve deceased relatives, the most significant factor in others might be the soul’s perceptions of the body from a vantage point outside it, seeing or travelling to other realms, having a panoramic life review, encountering the soul of a person not previously known to have died, having prophetic visions, or more generalized impressions of universal understanding and/or union.

      "title": "OPPORTUNISTIC DEXTERITY OR FLEXIBLE INTELLIGENCE?: CONTEMPLATING THE NATURE OF AMBIVALENCE INTRINSIC TO TRICKSTER ARCHETYPE FIGURES IN TRIBAL FOLKTALES OF JHARKHAND",
      "abstract": "Trickster figures are absolutely universal and they are creations of human collective unconsciousness. And advantageously as well disadvantageously they are not defined (confined) by any single characteristics as they are multifaceted entities, multiform beings and polytropos, with the accumulation of different qualities/features (such as ‘astuteness’, ‘ambivalence’, ‘wit’, ‘clever’, ‘cunning’, ‘tricky’, ‘creative falsehood’, ‘deceitful’ or ‘camouflage’, ‘clown’, ‘coward’, ‘cheat’, ‘humorous’, ‘brave’, etc.) and different forms (gods, demons, humans, animals), depending on the nature and requirement of the narrative programmes. Apart from being the fictional archfigures found in world mythology, folkloric materials and popular culture, the everyday social life of people is filled with the experiences of real tricksters, socially recognized antics of persons who enjoy mixed attributes of cleverness (i.e., good and bad), complementary to the logical rationality and being part of the periphery of their communities and not outside of the communities. Unlike mythological tricksters who are gods, demons, spirits and other supernatural beings, some of them are even known for having voracious appetites for food and bodily pleasure apart from being shape-shifters, rebellious and supreme boundary-crossers, their counterparts in folktales are simple, comprehensible, deliberate violators of social rules and norms, and cultural as well natural. A vast amount of trickster folktales is available in almost all languages across India. However, this study picks a few folktales from the tribal communities of Jharkhand, and the ‘tribal folktales’ is used as a category, a unit for analysis or a semiosphere to investigate the nature and interconnectedness of various elements associated with the trickster folktales. Grouped under four themes based on the actions of the protagonists or antagonists, this study proceeds to construct the nature and availability of oxymoronic figures as fundamental interdependent elements of these tales. This study reveals that the tribal tales have effectively utilized trickster characters to project the concept of altruism, along with the reflection of local culture and their critical interventions. It also highlights the facts that the trickster figures in these tales bring together two opposite worlds for different purposes through border-crossing which is a common phenomenon as far as the tribal trickster folktales are concerned, and it also reflects their worldview of coexistence attitude and perceiving them as an integral part of the ecosystem. Further, this study implies an essential point that the tricksters found in these tribal folktales perform as semiotic generators who mediate between opposites to allow a kind of cultural articulation of different cultural relationships, evaluate their contradictions and renew their moral and ethical values which are essential for the constitution and dissemination of their behaviour. Finally, this study promises to draw a brief sketch of the nature of tricksters and their social function and also unfolds the reason for the speculation that the tricksters are not enjoying heroic admiration and esteem despite their marvellous and altruistic heroic deeds.",

      "abstract": "Multispecies rhetoric functions as an umbrella for diverse approaches to more-than-human communications that invoke distinct varieties of relations among human and other creatures. Amid that diversity, rhetorical engagements in which all creatures “speak” with others in mutual, iterative exchange can become lost. My argument is, first, that this particular variety of multispecies conversation is rare in discussions of multispecies rhetoric because rhetorical engagement “with” other creatures is often underspecified, and because it is incompatible with Aristotelian foundations that still often underpin rhetorical inquiry; and second, that it should be cultivated so that humans can invite other creatures to be more interesting than the anthropoexceptionalist lens may suggest, such that we can accomplish more together. A multispecies rhetoric wherein humans speak with other creatures, not only speaking for, about, or around them, requires drawing a distinction between capacities to affect/be affected and assumptions about any creature’s internal state of mind.",

      "abstract": "With Jay, as with other patients in psychoanalysis, the pathological has shed light on the normal. First, during symbiosis, physical illness markedly disrupted his sense of well-being. He did not develop sufficient reserves of narcissism and instead built up a superabundance of hostile aggression. In the differentiation subphase of separation-individuation, his aggression could not be used constructively in the service of differentiation. In the practicing subphase, still immobilized, he was unable to effect even physical separation, let alone psychic separation. These subphase inadequacies, of course, influenced the character of his rapprochement subphase. With functioning already impaired by earlier subphase experience, continuing emotional pain and frustration affected his ability to negotiate the rapprochement subphase. Missing for Jay were the contributions that an adequate rapprochement subphase furnishes the organizing function of the ego. Not only did the rapprochement subphase fail to correct the inadequacies of the earlier subphases, the failures of rapprochement represented the last and final blow to the development of even a semblance of self- and object constancy, so that borderline pathology was the result. We can follow the progress made by the analysand by his own statements: Early: \"I don't have a reserve of self-love to carry me through.\" Later, \"I'm at a stage when I feel I can organize things without great anxiety. Plan things. Going ahead and slipping back sometimes too, but feeling confident.\" It has been the aim of this paper to show how the most malignant narcissistic rage has been converted into constructive aggression. Despite the greatest intrinsic and environmental odds, this patient, because of his good endowment, and aided by psychoanalysis, succeeded in gradually converting destructive aggression into constructive aggression by amalgamating it with more and more libido. Along with this, he also developed a sound secondary narcissism, so that his prognosis at eighteen years of age is optimistic.",

      "abstract": "Although our visual perceptions of objects and of other people are more than just visual -- enactively involving motor, affective, and evaluative processes -- our visual perception of the other person who is gazing back at us is more complex. I review two approaches to this complexity (Sartre, Levinas) and show how they both remain relatively abstract. I argue that visual perception of the other's gaze is always situated and involves complex interactive behavioral and response patterns that arise out of an active engagement which is always more than a simple recognition. I cite empirical studies to show that such social perception is not a matter of me seeing the other's gaze or face simpliciter, but of seeing that the other sees me. The other's gaze is not something that can be subsumed into a strictly visual representation of eye direction, for example. It has an affective impact on my own system that sets me up for further response. On concepts that acknowledge the involvement of embodied and worldly contexts, there is something immanent in the gaze; something that elicits an elementary responsivity that characterizes our intercorporeal encounters.",

      "abstract": "To speak of sensuous geographies as Other geographies is problematic. The senses do not work independently of culture and the sociopolitical implications of cultural identity formations—far from it! The senses are deeply implicated in the ways in which we make sense of the world as social beings: the way we understand or agree to understand—or compel each other to understand—the world. We sort stimuli according to the values or ideologies that govern our perception of reality. Ideas are in this way, literally, incorporated into the body’s perception of the world. We see and hear and smell what we think we see and hear and smell, or what preconceived Ideas of right and wrong, good and bad tell us that we see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. As the body and the sensory apparatus are generally made to operate in the service of shared sociocultural beliefs and political regimes of thought, the sensory world appears more often than not as a material confirmation of preconceived systems of meaning and value investments. Consider, for instance, the way certain smells may carry positive associations in some cultures and negative in others, or the way the perception of colors, like dark brown and light pink (or black and white), may be mediated by pre-perceptual values of good and bad, superiority and inferiority1—or how our minds can instruct our bodies to perceive a certain image or sound or smell or touch as a sensory signal that an abstract border is in operation or has been crossed.",

      "abstract": "If a hungry, thirsty, itchy person eats some food, or drinks some water, or intentionally scratches an itch, this is individual action. That is, it is the intentional behaviour of an ordinary individual human person; other human beings are not necessarily involved. If a person takes a walk down the road by herself for exercise, or eats an ice cream for pleasure, or takes a shower on a hot day, this is also individual action. Such action is not action in cooperation with, or necessarily directed at, other individuals. On the other hand, if an individual kicks or throws a football to a teammate in the course of a game of football, or puts a motion forward at a committee meeting, then this is social action. Most human action is in fact at some level, or to some extent, or in some sense, social action. Even these actions of eating, drinking, eating ice cream, individually walking down the road, or having a shower typically presuppose social forms or objects, such as farms, ice cream parlours, cups, roads, and shower rooms. But the de facto presupposition of social forms does not of itself vitiate the distinction between individual and social action. More generally, the sociality of most human action does not vitiate the distinction; it merely serves to illustrate the need to develop a more elaborate set of distinctions in this area. There is nothing to be gained from insisting that no actions are individual and/or that all actions are social, just because it might in fact be that all the actions of human beings connect in some way, however indirectly, with the actions of other human beings and with social forms and social objects.",

      "title": "Role playing in human evolution: from life to art, and everything in between",
      "abstract": "Role playing is a central, but underappreciated, process in human evolution. It is a feature not only of the theatrical arts, but of everyday social interactions. While some role playing is limited to enacting various personas of the self (e.g., wife, accountant, mother), others involve an impersonation of people. The most basic form of impersonation is proto-acting, which refers to a transient engagement in character portrayal, such as when we quote a friend during a conversation. During proto-acting, we \"act as\" some other person. However, there are other means of acting in a similar manner to another person in which we do not impersonate them, but merely emulate their behavior. This might happen when we learn a motor skill from a teacher or conform to the consumer choices of the masses. This follower-based process of \"acting like\" is a critically important mechanism in cultural evolution since it leads to social conformity and the homogenization of group behavior. I argue that the evolutionary transition from \"acting like\" (emulation) to \"acting as\" (impersonation) occurred via the emergence of pantomime and its narrative depiction of the actions of other people. This was probably the first step toward impersonating someone, leading initially to proto-acting and later to theatrical performance in human cultures. Overall, the study of human evolution needs to give greater consideration to role playing and its diverse manifestations in life and art.",

      "abstract": "Literary, aesthetic, and theoretical negotiations of repetition tend to focus on the category of repetition as a feature of spoken or written discourse, or visual or audible patterning, instantiated so as to produce a specific effect, such as of monotony or interruption. This effect is based upon a normative assumption that discourse will be structured according to a decorous balance between same and difference; when this decorum is not observed, a marked effect is realized. However, is repetition merely an aesthetic category deployed for local or ephemeral emotional or sematic emphasis? Given that exact repetition is perforce an impossibility, since no two moments are ever the same, nor is one moment the same as itself, what are the implications of this tension between an effect of sameness and an awareness of its impossibility? Are these implications ontological or metaphysical in character?",

      "abstract": "In this paper I would like to describe, even if in broad terms, certain ways, more or less adequate, in which it is possible to experience our own or others’ subjectivity and to acquire from it, in less unhappy cases, a more or less deep knowledge. In particular, I present an ecological model of the Self, which is capable of constituting, in the specific “sense” in which it manifests itself – the self-sense, the sense of our own embodied and embedded being – a fundamental presupposition of an eventual self-knowledge and knowledge of others. The self-sense or sense of our own living bodyness, evident, for example, in feeling good or bad in one’s own body, in the hunger or in the pain, in the attunement (or non-attunement) of the subject involved with its own environment and with other animals (human and non-human), points out, in other words, in the contextual perspective that is outlined, the minimal form that can assume self-knowledge and knowledge of others. In an indirect route, that is to say, turned towards the recognition of possible failures and pathologies of self-knowledge and knowledge of others, of “unhappy knowledge” so to speak, I uncover the role that self-sense and its eventual failure play in the possible conquest or failure of second-order self-knowledge and knowledge of others (social cognition, personal and interpersonal knowledge). Above all, I turn my attention to axiological-affective self-deceptions and to delusions and affective “blindness”, suggesting a possible alternative route, or at least an integrative route, in comparison with standard theories of self-deception and delusion, essentially characterized in a propositional sense. I show in the end the formative and transformative power of art, its expressive and material dimension and its therapeutic relevance or dis-illusory, absolutely antithetical, as such, to anaesthetizing or simply protective (of a would-be equilibrium of one’s own self) and adaptive power that certain self-deceptions can have.",

      "title": "Sammensmeltning/avstand og trekantforhold i familier med borderline ungdom",
      "abstract": "Borderline patients have a tendency to enter into relationships which seem addictive, intense, and brief. Their physical neediness causes them to “invade” their interpersonal objects in fantasy so as to become fused with them, and therefore to experience such claustrophobic anxiety as to necessitate breaking away into isolation and thereby to experience agoraphobia. In this article I have analyzed families with borderline members, vacillating between the desire for intense relationships on the one hand, and marked withdrawal and alienation, on the other. These vacillations are distinct, clear-cut and seem to be organized around a claustrophobia-agoraphobia dialectic.Borderline family members are afraid to be in an enclosed situation; they develop extreme claustrophobic anxiety or panic and recrue another family member (often a child) to avoid the catastrophe of identity diffusion. But when they are not contained they become agoraphobic and develop anxiety and panic. Thus they may experience object loss and complete annihilation. These vacillations are of such a discrete nature that they comprise, in my opinion, two nearly separately dissociated personalities - that is, split personalities - within the borderline self. Because the family members' internal resources for holding-soothing are always inadequate, the members must depend in an ongoing way upon external objects to supplement them enough to keep their muted anxiety at a signal level and to maintain relative psychological stability. The use of children is that they provide functions for another familiy member that are necessary for the maintenance of psychological integrity.",

To the abundant research on facial expressions, discussed in Chapter 2, the current chapter adds postures, gaze, appearance, breathing patterns, tone of voice, and emotional actions. All these have been shown to be sufficient to influence emotional feelings, as self-perception theory would predict. We not only feel angry if we frown but also feel sad if we sit in a slumped posture or talk in a slow, low voice; loving if we exchange mutual gaze with another, touch, or exchange confidences; and afraid if we escape a potential threat. Many of these studies involved manipulations that are unlikely to have provided opportunities for experimenter bias. None have been directed at the “necessity” question, and indeed in most cases many other sorts of cues are normally available, so we would not expect postures, gaze, and so on to be necessary. Finally, none of this research looked at real-world situations, although it seems very plausible that in real life, gazing leads to loving; depressed postures lead to sadness; and expressions of anger lead to more, not less, anger.",

In the present study, the go/no-go association task was used to assess implicit associations among social categories exemplifying the two senses of humanness, traits representing these senses, and the two types of nonhumans. Congruent associations (among artists, human-nature traits, and animals; among businesspeople, uniquely human traits, and automata) were consistently stronger than incongruent associations.

If the object's ego is not strong enough to resist these manipulations, it is pressured into a submissive relationship. By means of seduction or its opposite, intimidation and the use of threats, the object is made to believe the content of the denying persons's inner or external world. The result is a mutually intrusive and reciprocal relationship in which the roles of victim and perpetrator alternate. This is the case when children are not allowed to acquire their own experiences during the process of transition from symbiosis to separation. Constant exposure to irritation leads to a regression of the ego, to the illusion that everything is possible in the 'we'. Object relations in adult life are then based on a parasitic need for the object in order to realize inner goals. In analysis this is manifested as symbiotic omnipotence, posing a 'serious stumbling block' to the analytic process, which may take the form of an 'as-if' analysis.",

Material signals fall into two main classes: directing-to and placing-for. In directing-to, people request addressees to direct their attention to objects, events, or themselves. In placing-for, people place objects, actions, or themselves in special sites for addressees to interpret. Both classes have many subtypes. Features of material signals were examined in pairs of people who were videotaped as they assembled TV stands, built Lego models, planned furnishings for a house, played piano duets, or bought coffee at Starbucks. In these activities, the pointing and placements were often sustained, creating three phases of signals – initiation, maintenance, and termination – each with its own interpretation.",

If the individual would not interest himself \"aggressively\" for the human beings surrounding himself, if he would not be \"hungry\" for human contact he would not associate himself for pairing and groups. He would not look for individuals who are of the same mind. This existential hunger, which is laid down in his nervous system seeking for stimuli, contains always an \"aggressive\" interest and leads man also towards searching scientifically his own psychosomatic conditions and the whole world. But this hunger can lead in certain men and under favouring conditions in whole groups and peoples to dimensions which endanger individuality and the human pride. This aggression then does not any longer serve communication but further incorporation and power. It is the beginning of the way leading to destruction of human values and human life. The responsibilities of our society should keep in mind that the human readiness for aggression does not drive further in the direction of violence and should rather be developed in the sense originally inherent to her: of an interest in the surrounding human beings and in nature.",

Human communication includes incidental forms of communication such as the crying of newborn babies as well as intentional forms based on anticipating others' responses, which begin to emerge before infants' first birthdays. It is the latter form of communication that language is based on and is usually considered communication. But to understand the development of human forms of communication, it is important to conceptualize communication broadly. Doing so requires being aware of the way in which preconceptions influence how this topic is approached and how evidence is interpreted. I articulate how communication can be viewed from the perspectives of two contrasting worldviews that can be characterized as conceiving of the individual as the starting point and source of social development or, in contrast, as the outcome of social development, in which case the starting point is the process of social interaction leading to increasingly complex forms of interaction.",

Third, a law-abiding subject may be (mis)guided by their superego, taking comfort in inhuman bystander legalism. Fourth, institutional dynamics can spearhead bystander groupthink. The stories of Job and Jesus show that bystanders—whether active, passive, or interactive—often play an important role in human affairs.

      "abstract": "At the time of the last major review on this subject in the British journal of Psychology (Walker, 1980) there was, with a few notable exceptions, little evidence of anatomical or behavioural asymmetries in non‐human species at all comparable to our own. In the past decade the picture has changed dramatically, and now includes invertebrates from the Cambrian formations of half a billion years ago, many species of birds, rats and mice, antelopes, cats, dogs, whales, and primates. Asymmetries may differ as a function of sex (including hormone status–females of many species including humans appearing more lateralized at a motor level), developmental status and environmental influences. Effects may be manifest anatomically (limb or brain dimensions), or at a sensory, cognitive or motor level (paw preference, turning biases). A recurring observation across species is that the right hemisphere seems to be weakly specialized for spatial and emotional roles, and the left for learning, discriminatory and communicatory functions. Three million years ago our hominid ancestors were more or less fully bipedal, developed the first stone tools and were dextral in manipulating them. However, tool use seems not to have driven the evolution of language, our other strongly lateralized capacity. Evolutionary scenarios for bipedalism, tool use and language are discussed, together with the question of whether human language is continuous, in an evolutionary sense, with earlier primate call systems.",

This practice has evolved through collaboration, within and across successive performative encounters. Through the intra-acting agencies of performative encounter, the material and the verbal are in conversation, questioning the production of knowledge, critically and metaphorically determined as a ‘digestive tract of knowing’. A material engagement emerges that is continuously enmeshed, unravelled and revealed as an embodied tract that surfaces as diagram, apparatus or a conjunction of vertices. In this context, words, whether written, spoken, uttered or as yet unsaid, are interior to the practice. Together and continuously, their shared and formative meanings are mobile, never settling, always productive. Whether critically informed or invented on the spur of the moment, words (including the writing of this article) act as material-discursive fabric. This research-in-action is evident both in the operative engagement and in the subsequent opening of the practice to others, whether as display, text, performance or dialogic example.",

      "abstract": "Animal signals, whether vocal or visual, are largely innate, and so there can be no misunderstanding about their meaning. The flattening of a dog's ears means fear, the curl of his lip implies aggression. If a Gelada monkey lifts his eyebrows to reveal a yellow stripe, he is under threat. Animal signals are limited and inflexible, but they are precise and unlikely to be misconstrued (Ardrey 1970). The human animal is often unaware that his actions, gestures and expressions are telling their own clear story — they are the outward signals of inner attitudes and tensions. Man concentrates so hard on his words that he often seems to forget that the coded messages from his body can be either contradicting or confirming the words from his mouth. It is as if two languages are being spoken simultaneously: the familiar verbal messages and transmissions from the subconscious which are often visible rather than audible. Interpretation of gestures, tones, postures and behaviour is like translating a foreign language (the subconscious) into a common language.",

      "title": "The Way to Nearness: Heidegger's Interpretation of Presence",
      "abstract": "Howard Eiland THE WAY TO NEARNESS: HEIDEGGER'S INTERPRETATION OF PRESENCE WHAT DO WE mean when we speak of \"presence\"? Do we refer to the ostensibly concrete, pragmatic presence of things at hand, of objects lying before us which we may touch and manipulate? Do we include the often nonproximate presence of persons, for example, an author's mediated influence, or the emergent presence of moods, of weathers, of responsibilities — in other words, things which we cannot touch but which nonetheless touch us? Have we pondered this wide-ranging parasensuous sense of \"touch\"? Have we distinguished between the presence of now and of here or, alternately, grasped the intimate complicity of spatial presence and temporal present, as something that goes beyond mere terminology? For that matter, what about the intangible but weighty presence of words, meaning not just external signs — written or phonetic, not just language as a body of information or a scheme for communication , but language as a universal function transcending the status of instrument or entity, a function neither objective nor subjective, language as the very condition of intelligibility and multidimensional articulation? In what sense is the sense of what is said — whether verbally, in \"body language,\" or in other modes of expression (such as images) — present to one who follows? For the words \"sense\" and Sinn, as Martin Heidegger explains in his preoccupation with the latent poetry of idiom, originally signify way, course.1 Is presence, as something that elusively concerns and bears upon, homes in, touches, means, perhaps associated with following a way or going through? These questions announce the main themes of my discussion. If presence has to do with \"throughness,\" it is probably no accident that Heidegger's approach to the problem, which claimed his attention practically from start to finish of his long career, comes itself to resemble a series of ever renewed attacks on an ever receding stronghold. Conceived as necessarily experimental and provisional, this project involves, as I shall indicate, the assumption of now one word, now another, in the endeavor to name, invoke, and thus draw into a luminous clearing, the specter ofpresence. But throughout 43 44Philosophy and Literature these various thought-forays, which he understands as constellatory facets of \"the same,\" that specter refuses open manifestation. After all, to grasp, or even thematize, presence is like touching touch: the subject matter is at once too abstract and too near. Which is to say, it remains, to the eye of inquiry, unavailingly far. What is nearest is paradoxically most remote; and if this is so, then how much further still from any apprehension is nearness itself. Heidegger raises these issues as a way into the problematic of presence, a way of focusing this most abstract of subjects. For if presence involves a spatial-temporal going through, then it accordingly comprises a fabric of nears and fars — though these are not to be taken as contradictory attributes. If presence is what occupies and weighs upon us, then becoming present may be thought of as a nearing: what means something to us we hold near. The problem comes in reflecting on this holding near of what holds our closest attention. In such reflection we gain distance from the phenomenon as a phenomenon and thus make possible an approach to its meaning. It is distance, then, which, hard won, frees the advent ofwhat is to be thought, what \"calls,\" while nearness actually impedes access: the nearer, indeed, the more impenetrable. \"Nearness maintains farness.\"2 We should not confuse this interplay of near and far, which Heidegger insists is neither complementary nor dialectical, with the grid of geometric parameters. Diminution of extension is not the same as nearing. In Being and Time (Section 23), he essays some deceptively familiar examples of what he means by nearness. An easily accessible road of many miles may not be so long a haul, so considerable a span, as a shorter but more difficult route. Two farmhouses separated by acres of fields may yet be in closer touch than adjacent townhouses (or adjacent apartments, we might interject). Other examples, broaching the problem from a different angle, include the relative remoteness ofthe eyeglasses resting on one's nose...",

The connection of alienation to moral self-reproach is easy to see in such cases. But it is also possible to be alienated from experiences of non-human targets, such as buildings or natural landscapes. And it turns out moral self-reproach plays a role in those cases, too. Exploring experiences of non-human targets helps reveal how we can be alienated from experiences in which we aren’t, strictly speaking, misperceiving the target of our experience at all. It also helps clarify the role of distinctively moral self-reproach, as against self-reproach of other types, in driving alienation.",

      "abstract": "There are a number of ways in which a person can share the guilt of another's wrongdoing. He might advise it, command it or consent to it. He might provoke it, praise it, flatter the wrongdoer, or conceal the wrong. He might stay silent when there is a clear duty to denounce the wrong or its perpetrator; or he might positively defend the wrong done. Finally, he might actively participate or co-operate in the wrongdoing. These various activities, apart from co-operation, typically occur before or after the commission of the wrong itself, only provocation being essentially before the fact. As such they fall into the categories of seduction or comfort, seduction being essentially pre-commission and comfort post-commission. In seduction (mutatis mutandis for comfort), the seducer typically leads another into doing wrong who has not definitely made up his mind. He does not assist in the commission, but he leads to its occurring. If the principal (as I will call the one who commits the wrong) has made up his mind, actions which might otherwise amount to seduction are best characterized as amounting to scandal, since they do not lead to wrong but reinforce the principal in his wrongful intent or provide to third parties a bad example since they connote approval of the principal's action. Closely related to the concept of seduction is that of solicitation, though perhaps these are best thought of as two aspects of the same kind of activity.",

      "title": "Physiology, Long Term Memory",
      "abstract": "Memory is a complex brain function to store and retrieve information. In humans, memories of life experiences collectively contribute to represent who we are. It is a function that helps us interact with our environment; similar situations evoke specific responses, known faces evoke reactions, and repeated stimuli help us how to learn and respond. Long-term memories divide into two different groups, procedural and declarative. Procedural memory involves certain activities we learn by practicing and repeated exposure to a series of motor outputs (for example, riding a bicycle or driving a car). Declarative memories, able to be consciously recalled, are comprised of two other groups: semantic memories representing discrete facts such as dates, word definitions, and learned concepts, and episodic memories that represent explicit experiences one has lived through, such as a special birthday or one’s wedding day. The literature sometimes refers to these two groups of long-term memories implicit or explicit, respectively, though these terms aren’t utilized as much because they are more ambiguous. Long-term memory is consolidated from short-term to long-term memories, primarily in the hippocampus and stored throughout the cortex. These interconnected structures help one interpret stimuli to act accordingly, either by retrieving old memories to help us navigate or by storing them so we can start learning more.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are a complex and constantly growing phenomenon; there are several therapies designed to treat this disease. But what do we mean when we talk about disease and treatment? What is an eating disorder? Is it a clinical disease? A psychological ailment? A reaction to difficulties encountered in particular socio-relational environments? Behind the symptom is always a person who, consciously or unconsciously, is the cause of their own discomfort. The symptom is a symbolic representation of an inner conflict, betraying difficulties in relating to oneself, to others and to reality. A valid method of treating eating disorders is the theatre experience, primarily in workshop form. Theatre experience is inherently about openness to others and to oneself; it can be tool for developing a new perspective, for looking after oneself, for discovering one’s body as an authentic, deep and healthy interface between an individual and the world, which is necessary for constructing a positive self-image. Through play, and in an environment perceived as safe and removed from everyday reality, the individual can follow a process of experimentation, creation and expression (perceived as impossible in ordinary life) which can lead to a new way of living. Starting from current studies on eating disorders and their connection with social dynamics, and based on personal experience in leading a theatre group of girls with eating disorders in a collaborative project with the medical team of therapeutic communities in Asso (at Sant’Anna Hospital, Como), this essay aims to evaluate theatre’s potential as an effective, long-lasting treatment for eating disorders, one that gives the individual a chance to extend this potential to their own everyday life as the foundation for broader social change.",

      "title": "The Elements of Play: Toward a Philosophy and a Definition of Play.",
      "abstract": "Scholars conventionally find play difficult to define because the concept is com- plex and ambiguous. The author proffers a definition of play that takes into con- sideration its dynamic character, posits six basic elements of play (anticipation, surprise, pleasure, understanding, strength, and poise), and explores some of their emotional, physical, and intellectual dimensions. He argues for a play ethos that recognizes play is evolution based and developmentally beneficial. He insists, how- ever, that, at its most elemental, play always promises fun. In this context, any activity that lacks these six elements, he contends, will not fully qualify as play. Key words: definition of play; elements of play; universe of playPlay is a roomy subject, broad in human experience, rich and various over time and place, and accommodating pursuits as diverse as peekaboo and party banter, sandlot baseball and contract bridge, scuba diving and Scrabble. Play welcomes opposites, too. Play can be free-ungoverned by anything more complicated than choosing which stick is best to improvise a light saber-or fixed and codified, as in those instances when soccer players submit to scrupu- lous ?laws.? Play can take active or passive form and can be vicarious or engag- ing-and so we recognize play in both the spectator and the actor. In fact, at play we may even become both spectator and actor, straining with an air-guitar at a concert for example or sympathetically enacting the motions of the quarter- back's long bomb during the big game.1 We have no trouble recognizing play in the premeditated prank or the instant wisecrack. And then play can be solitary or social-as enjoyed by a woodcarver at his bench or a quilter during her bee. We can find play in the spaces in between, too, as children engage imaginary friends without quite being alone or as gamers play together on the Internet without meeting face-to-face.We can take in play at a glance in these instances, following its course and knowing it confidently when we see it, but observation does not automatically bring us closer to refining the concept. In fact, the opposite seems to be the case: the settings change, the play interval varies, the intensity rises and falls, and then intent and other human circumstances shift and morph. The more we look and listen, the more we feel our confidence slip away. But if our eyes fail us, perhaps the mind can compensate. Can we imagine a satisfying definition, one true of play wherever and whenever there are players and however they play? Can we specify ideal, unvarying, dependable attributes of play?Many thinkers have proposed so, noting salient aspects of play. Gordon Burghardt, for example, in his searching The Genesis of Animal Play (2005), identified twelve characteristics of play. And Thomas Henricks, in his thought- ful Play Reconsidered (2006), noted that scholars have tended to isolate volition, pretending, ordering, seclusion, and secrecy.2 Boil the lists down, and five basic qualities emerge: play is apparently purposeless, voluntary, outside the ordinary, fun, and focused by rules. Identifying the attributes of play like this can prove very useful if we understand them as criteria, and once having so identified these criteria, apply them as standards.Thus, first, play exists for its own sake. Players do not aggressively seek out some other purpose to play. In fact, trying to twist play to an end vitiates it, making it seem less and less like play. Second, players play of their own accord. Third, play is special and set apart. Sometimes players reserve a particular setting for playing, and no matter how different from each other, the field, the stadium, the woods, the rink, the court, and the ring all serve as playgrounds. Fourth, play is fun, a criterion not so simple as it sounds because people can find fun in a dizzying variety of activities. And fifth, players play by rules. Rules are not just for organizing games and making them fair, they keep games interesting and keep games going. …",

The conception that I have of the site and the moment of knowledge construction is that these are inherently intimate, also ambiguous, unstable, subject to risk and overdetermination. It becomes the job of the disciplinary discourse to normalize and contain this process, to draw off the element of risk and playfulness. It is the job of an analysis like this one to restage the drama and intimacy of these encounters, as a way of understanding better the nature of the discourse and the forms of knowledge that do and do not arise from it.

From the perspective, emotional responses are able to act quickly to interrupt ongoing cognitive activity (fear of a charging bull interrupts our musings on a country walk). This automaticity of emotional response may apply to emotional expression too. Part of the functional value of emotional expression is that, for most of us most of the time, it is an accurate reflection of our internal states and thus can be trusted by an observer. Failures at a cognitive level to recognise all the schemas being activated by an emotional episode may prolong emotional responses. From an evolutionary perspective, emotions probably developed as part of responses by the individual to threats in the environment.",

Hence, for Kuranko, wale (duty or work) is \"that which you have to do\", by contrast with desire, which is what you might want to do. To express one's feelings or speak one's mind without taking into account the feelings or thoughts of others, is frowned upon; but so too is slavish adherence to social norms. Accordingly, a viable social life consists in making emotionality serve rather than subvert the common weal, a matter of giving equal expression to freedom and restraint. For Kuranko, this involves a continual adjustment of the bush (associated with antinomian impulses) and the village (associated with law and order).",

Contrary to this stable situation, we can say that the fictions of Borges are dealing with singular circumstances in which the relation between representation and the represented dissolves, that is, situations in which representation as such becomes impossible. We then have the following two possibilities. Either the fictions are splendid constructions, and yet they belong to the fantastic in the sense of the impossible and therefore have no bearing on the reality of human cognition. Or they are fantastic and yet they are realistic, but not on the macrolevel of reality where cognition and representation works. On a fine-grained level of representation, on a microlevel so to speak, a reality appears which is not subjected to the linguistic and logical form of everyday life. If this reality appears on the macrolevel it causes a destabilization.",

      "abstract": "Many species of animals have consciousness, intentionality, and thought processes. By “consciousness” I mean those subjective states of sentience and awareness that we have during our waking life (and at a lower level of intensity in our dreams); by “intentionality” I mean that feature of the mind by which it is directed at or about objects and states of affairs in the world; and by “thought processes” I mean those temporal sequences of intentional states that are systematically related to each other, where the relationship is constrained by some rational principles. Examples of conscious states are such things as feeling a pain or hearing a sound. Examples of intentional states are such things as wanting to eat food or believing that someone is approaching. Examples of thought processes are such things as figuring how to get a banana that is out of reach or monitoring the behavior of prey who is on the move and is trying to escape. Though these three phenomena – consciousness, intentionality, and thought processes – overlap, they are not identical. Some conscious states are intentional, some not. Some intentional states are conscious, many are not. For example, my current thought that it is unlikely to rain is conscious, my belief when I am asleep that Bill Clinton is president of the United States is unconscious. All thought processes, as I have defined them, are intentional; but not every intentional state occurs as part of a thought process. For example, a pang of undirected anxiety, though conscious, is not intentional. A sudden desire for a cold beer is both conscious and intentional.",

The reasons for the evil eye can be diverse and they talk about the way in which certain qualities or attributions are perceived, the disenchantment describing sometimes a genuine ceremonial, meant to reestablish the initial order. The content of the disenchantment referrers to certain additional elements, certain plants with prophylactic valences, to specific attitudes. The particularities of these protective practices include either some references to the prophylactic, apothropaic elements – of keeping away the evil, of protection (not to catch it): garlic, basil or different practices meant to remove the evil eye. The typology of the disenchantment takes into consideration their destination, being either a remedy, either protection for the households. These former practices lead to a wide range of gestures orientated towards prophylaxis and remedies, an ensemble of attitudes that draw the attention of the researchers through the richness of their symbolism.\"",

In extensions of the concept, however, only one person is concerned in the two facts, or both original agents are replaced by two different ones (as explained shortly). The agents are often individuals, but they can also be groups or institutions of various kinds.

      "abstract": "The implicit foundation of communication in the contemporary society is that we live in a world of relationships, that the relationships are the ultimate background of reality. The theoretical model of communication based on building relationships that replaced the model of information transmission produces an ontological change in the representation of the world. This is duet o the fact that, different from the former image of the world having its principle outside it, in the transcendence or from that of the immanent metaphor of world, that of essence-core and phenomenon-peel, the corollary of the current representation of world as a web of relationships is an ontology embodied in virtual reality and communication and exchange relationships. Not any exchange is actually communication, just like not any communication is an exchange, but more generally, all are relationships and relationship adjustment. Complex dialectics raise between power and communication. Power becomes important when communication is missing or disputable, when there is no dialogue or negotiation, when the contracts are breached. On the other hand, communication is important as soon as the power is weaker, namely when its pyramidal structure disintegrates. The modern society has mainly evolved to this direction of power dissemination: to delegate, to leave the power to someone according to the social control. Political imposition of communication seems to be the most direct consequence of such dissemination of power. The triumph of communication in the power dissolution is due to the ideal of fluidisation. What is happening now is that we move out of the comfortable episteme of knowledge and we settle in the uncomfortably fluid episteme of communication.",

We constantly apply it in interactions between people, organizations, animals, and even artifacts. We use it instinctively and implicitly in closed and static systems, or consciously and explicitly in open or dynamic systems. An epitome for the former case is a small village, where everybody knows everybody, and the villagers instinctively use their knowledge or stereotypes to trust or distrust their neighbors. A big city exemplifies the latter case, where people use explicit rules of behavior in diverse trust relationships. We already use trust in computing systems extensively, although usually subconsciously. The challenge for exploiting trust in computing lies in extending the use of trust-based solutions, first to artificial entities such as software agents or subsystems, then to human users' subconscious choices.",

      "title": "Imitation and Empathy in Infancy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Numerous writers have described how imitation may lead to empathy: when an imitator performs the same behavior as another, she may experience, directly or through associated memories, the same cognitions and emotions as the person being imitated. Meltzoff's recent description of newborn infants' ability to recognize selfother equivalences in action - the 'Like me' framework - links imitation and empathy in this way. The theory builds on reports that infants can imitate from birth. However, evidence for newborn imitation is open to alternative interpretation. Other findings indicate that infants' voluntary reproduction of actions of others requires substantial learning and emerges in the second year. Evidence of such learning is presented here, and implications for studying the origins of imitation and empathy are discussed. KEYWORDS: infancy, imitation, empathy, newborn. The potential for a close link between the ability to imitate others and the ability to empathize with others has been appreciated by researchers and theorists dating back at least to the late 19th century (see Iacoboni, 2009, for several early sources; see also Freud, 1921). 'Empathy' in their writings refers variously to the ability of one person to either understand or share the thoughts, motivations, intentions, or emotional experiences of another, without having had those private events explicitly communicated to them - for example, in language (Singer, 2006). The proposed role of imitation in producing empathy is to bring the person imitating into the same experiential context as the person being imitated, thus creating in the imitator a set of private experiences - understanding and/or emotional responses - that are either immediately evoked by that context or associated with that context in memory, and that match (or at least are thought to match) the private experiences of the person being imitated. Recent years have seen a rise in research studies and theoretical papers concerned with the origins of imitation and empathy in infancy (e.g., Meltzoff, 1995; 2002; 2005; 2007a; 2007b; Meltzoff & Decety, 2003; Singer, 2006), and with the neural underpinnings of these abilities in infants, children, and adults (e.g., Carr, Iacoboni, Dubeau, Mazziotta, & Lenzi, 2003; Dapretto, Davies, Pfeifer, Scott, Sigman, Bookheimer, & Iacoboni, 2006; de Waal, 2008; Decety & Jackson, 2004; Fogassi, Ferrari, Gesierich, Rozzi, Chersi, & Rizzolatti, 2005; Gallese, 2005; Gallese & Goldman, 1998; Gazzola, Aziz-Zadeh, & Keysers, 2006; Iacoboni, 2005; 2009; Iacoboni, Molnar-Szakacs, Gallese, Buccino, Mazziotta, & Rizzolatti, 2005; Iacoboni, Woods, Brass, Bekkering, Mazziotta, & Rizzolatti, 1999; Kaplan & Iacoboni, 2006; Pfeifer, Iacoboni, Mazziotta, & Dapretto, 2008; Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004). The purpose of this article is to examine one segment of this growing literature - that is, current thinking and evidence on the origins of imitation and empathy in infancy - and to identify the implications of this examination for future research on the origins of empathy. The origins of imitation and empathy in infancy: the 'like me' hypothesis The dominant theory of the origins of imitation, and the body of evidence that supports it, have been developed over many years by Meltzoff (e.g., 2002; 2005; 2007a; 2007b), and by Meltzoff and Moore (e.g., 1977; 1983; 1989; 1992; 1994; 1997). In Meltzoff's recent formulations (e.g., Meltzoff, 2002; 2005; 2007a; 2007b; Meltzoff & Decety, 2003), it is clear that this account of the origins of imitation is also a theory of the origins of empathy. The source of empathy is described by the 'Like me' hypothesis (e.g., Meltzoff, 2005; 2007a; 2007b), which follows in the tradition of simulation theories of empathy (e.g., Gallese & Goldman, 1998). The 'Like me' hypothesis proposes that the infant from birth can experience others as 'Like me' through her own imitative acts. …",

In the current study we tested whether dogs disobeyed a prohibition to take a treat (i) in the presence of the communicator of the ban, (ii) after a temporary absence of the communicator, and (iii) in the presence of a novel person. Dogs disobeyed the rule significantly more often when the communicator left the room for a moment or when they were faced with a new person, than when she stayed present in the room. These results indicate that dogs \"forget\" a rule as soon as the immediate human context becomes disrupted.",

Firstly, robots need to cope with uncertainty during interaction, especially when dealing with factors that are not fully observable and hard to infer (latent variables) such as the states representing the dynamic environment and human behavior (e.g., intents, goals, preferences). Secondly, robots need to communicate their behaviors to agents (humans and other robots in the environment) in a clear and understandable manner.

      "title": "NATURE FEARS EMPTINESS : AN ANALYTICAL READING OF EMOTIONAL EMPTINESS",
      "abstract": "Nature does things well, but sometimes it takes crooked paths... In psychoanalysis, the role of the psychoanalyst, as of any other therapist, is not only to set clinical goals, to understand the psychic work of the patient and to accompany him in his self-discovery. Above all, it is supposed to manage the internal conflicts of the suffering subject. To do this, he seeks to shed light on his unconscious journey and detect the vagaries of his psychic functioning. He try to act on his commitment, motivation and adherence to the values of the society in which he lives, without hindering his subjectivity. This human mission is often complex because individuals are free and autonomous beings. They should not be treated as if they were instruments of any society. These people are also specific: they each have a particular childhood and social background. They have a different history and heritage, do not have the same ambitions, the same responsibilities, or the same dreams or professional goals. In short, individuals are very heterogeneous. This increases the difficulty of supporting them therapeutically and requires helping them to flourish despite their traumas. However, the trauma and the emotional emptiness it causes, added to the pain it causes, create a strong internal uncertainty in the patient. The psychoanalyst must endeavour to take this into account. The effectiveness of the intervention depends on the psychoanalyst's ability to understand and analyze the patient's behaviour in light of the psychological evidence. In this article, we will look at clinical cases representing essential facets of human behavior as well as the theories behind them. The approach is quintessentially Freudian. These conceptual foundations provide the clinic with levers for action to heal people. We analyze human behavior according to the social environment with which it interacts and which will cause its pathology to evolve... thus forging one's own nature.",

An inquiry of this kind must be very general: a basic function of speech or writing is the communication of ideas and this process is intimately related to the cognitive abilities of man, his capacity for drawing inferences from past experience. The process of communication always presupposes an audience-real or imagined, and listeners are social-psychological entities: they interpret, they assimilate, they respond, all in terms of their cognitive abilities, their past experiences, their social histories. Thus a theory of the composing process must be at least as general as any psychological theory of the individual or any sociological theory of interacting men. There is a central issue in all discussions relating to communication via language which must be dealt with before all else. This is the question of whether linguistic expressions are fixed vehicles that carry meaning, like a fountain pen that holds ink, or are they more like the ink itself which spreads on the paper in varying shapes under the will of the hand that holds it.

We present representations and algorithms that enable an artificial agent to correctly recognize other agents' activities by observing their behavior.

It was in the pause that trailed from his remark of eight, ten, twelve seconds ago” (1). Lauren Hartke, Don DeLillo’s protagonist in The Body Artist (1), does not have to look at her husband to feel him drifting away. Words and pauses between them carry a wealth of information about the speakers’ intentions and emotions. Words, however, cannot only be heard but also can be seen being signed in sign language. How does the brain go about extracting identity and emotional cues from sentences when they arrive via different senses? Are they duly processed in their corresponding sensory cortices: the speaking speaker’s identity and emotional tone in the auditory cortex and the signing speaker’s identity and emotional tone in the visual cortex? Alternately, do they converge rapidly into one common brain area, irrespective of whether the conversation is heard or seen? If the latter is the case, where would that area be? Deaf signers can communicate through the visual channel with a dexterity that matches spoken communication between two speakers. This capacity gives one a rare opportunity to explore fundamental questions on how different parts of the brain go about dividing their labor. Now, in PNAS, Benetti et al. (2) bring important insights into this matter.\n\nFor many decades, it has been thought that a fundamental principle of brain organization is the division of that labor between separate sensory systems (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile). Consequently, experience-dependent changes were thought to occur almost exclusively within the bounds of this division: Visual training would cause changes in the visual cortex, and so on (e.g., ref. 3).

      "title": "Human Primitive Behavior",
      "abstract": "In dangerous, strenuous, or life-threatening situations, some behavioral patterns may occur that do not belong to the \"normal\" spectrum of human behavior. Among these are what is referred to here as \" sedimentation\" (which may result in the finding of a feeble person or a deceased in topographically low-lying sections of buildings), as well as the phenomena of hiding and covering and undressing (a well-known phenomenon related to fatal hypothermia), and other behavioral elements of minor relevance like confusion, fumbling, and screaming. These behavioral peculiarities may lead to dubious findings at a death scene and may be mistaken for signs of a preceding crime by the unwary. Sometimes, circumstantial findings seem to indicate that a fight or a violent or sexual offense took place. However, a more thorough analysis of the scene often shows that the whole situation had been created by the deceased himself or herself prior to death without any third-party involvement. The aforementioned behavioral elements are termed \" primitive\" here because at least some of them, like covering and hiding, seem to originate from early developmental stages of human instinctive behavior as a reaction pattern in response to danger and stress that also can be observed in animals. These behavioral patterns have their origin in phylogenetically old, autonomous parts of the brain. A good knowledge of the elements and patterns of human primitive behavior and the associated ways of acting is most helpful to all those involved in the death investigation because it often helps in the correct interpretation of curious death scene scenarios that otherwise would remain obscure or even enigmatic. Also, search and rescue teams will benefit from taking these behavioral patterns into consideration because they enable the development of improved search strategies for seeking missing persons.",

      "title": "DIRECTED ACTION AND ANIMAL COMMUNICATION",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human action theory, with its emphasis on intentions and reasons, does little to enhance our understanding of the actions of nonhuman animals. Many animal (and human) actions are directed to objects in the world, including other animals. The notion of directedness can be analysed without attributing intentions or reasons to the agent. An action is directed to object X if and only if: (1) the agent singles out X, either by orientation or by selective performance of the action in the presence of X; (2) the agent recognizes X as a suitable object; and (3) the goal of the action is that X should be in a certain relation to the agent or to some other object. The goal of an action is not necessarily attributable to the agent as the agent's goal in acting. Moreover, an agent can have a goal in acting without understanding how the action achieves the goal. The usefulness of the concept of directed action in the study of animal communication is illustrated with examples from the recent ethological literature.",

In this definition, mimicry is closely related to mimesis or the practice of representation in literature, performance, and the visual arts. Yet in contrast to mimesis, which often seeks to reproduce an image of the object that is being copied, mimicry can have a humorous and even subversive potential that deliberately sets out to challenge the meaning of the object that is being copied or represented. This is not to say that the act or practice of imitation is restricted to literature and the visual arts, however, since the imitation of other human beings is also one of the formative processes through which children learn to speak, act, and perform as socialized human subjects. Furthermore, in biology, the practice of mimicry denotes the close external resemblance of an animal or plant to another, or to an inanimate object (OED) , in some instances as a tactic of self‐defense.",

      "title": "The Role of Gestures in Communication",
      "abstract": "Because it plays such a very significant role in the life of every human being, it is difficult to imagine a world without communication. After all, communication, both verbally and nonverbally, has occurred and evolved between people since the dawn of humankind. As it is, during communicative interaction, verbal contact is supplemented with non-verbal information, laying the foundation for full-fledged communication. That means that nonverbal communication is an essential aspect of speech communication because it can either greatly increase the semantic meaning of a word or significantly weaken it. Moreover, non-verbal means of communication are typically expressive and laconic and greatly increase the possibilities of communication between people. That being said, one of the most commonly used non-verbal communications is gestures. In communication, gestures accompany speech or replace it. Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other body parts, and each person uses various motions in communication to convey his thoughts. The gestures we use in daily communication add to a language’s vocabulary and syntax. Furthermore, a gesture is more expressive than a unit of verbal language. With this in mind, this article discusses the various aspects of non-verbal communication and provides examples of typical gestures a person uses in everyday communication. This study consisted of 50 students ranging in age from 17 to 25 years old and aimed to reveal what types of gestures are used much more frequently by young people in everyday life.",

      "title": "Balance and Falls among Older People",
      "abstract": "An increasing body of clinical and basic research acknowledges the functional decline of sensory and integrative systems in older adults and associates impairments in these systems with an increase in falls. The risk of falls underscores the importance of the of the older adult to be able to receive and integrate sensory information and to take appropriate action to avoid falling. BALANCE, THE SIXTH SENSE What does a complaint of feeling off-balance mean? The complaint could refer to an unwanted interaction of prescribed or over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies, an underlying cardiovascular problem, or age-related or disease-related declines in the balance system. Balance instability is a marker of fall risk and frailty. Balance is the ability of the person to remain in equilibrium and to orient to gravity, the support surface, and to objects in the environment when performing routine activities of daily living (Newton, 2002). Balance could also be described as the to maintain one's lifestyle without falling. Balance is needed when standing or sitting still and when moving in the environment. Anticipatory balance responses precede movements such as raising the arm up to comb one's hair, reaching for an object on a high shelf, or putting dishes in the dishwasher. Older adults with balance dysfunction due to age-related declines or other problems might hold on to the sink in order to perform these routine tasks. Holding on to an object or a person to avoid falling may be a good strategy, providing the object or person is stable. Compensatory balance responses occur in reaction to an external event such as being pushed or tripping over an obstacle. Compensatory balance responses are automatic, occur within 90 milliseconds, and help the individual maintain or regain balance following the perturbing event. The three most important sensory systems responsible for good balance are the visual system, the vestibular system (involving the inner ear), and the somatosensory system (a complex collection of sensors that transmit information about the state of the body and its immediate environment). For example, the somatosensory receptors located in the legs and feet provide information about the condition of the support surface-slippery floor, high pile rug. Receptors (called proprioceptors because they respond to stimuli within an organism) located in the neck and trunk provide information about the alignment of the back and head. Vision provides information about the location and dimension of objects in the environment and the condition of the support surface and lighting. The vestibular receptors in the inner ear provide information about the position of the person in space-moving, turning, and tilting. Many age-related changes that affect balance occur gradually, permitting older adults to compensate until they reach a critical point that results in balance instability. These age-related changes include a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensory receptors that monitor information, a slowing of the nervous system capabilities, and muscle weakness due to inactivity. Gradual declines in these systems also occur with disease. For example, peripheral diabetic neuropathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of falls. Older adults tend to place greater reliance on the visual system to compensate for age or disease-related reductions in the vestibular or somatosensory system, even when visual information is misleading. Relying on one sensory system is problematic; adults over the age of 65 with visual impairments are at least three times more likely than unimpaired adults to have difficulty with mobility, for example in walking, going outside, and performing routine daily activities (Maino, 1996). Wearing bifocal or trifocal or progressive lenses affects the capability to detect environmental hazards by impairing contrast sensitivity and depth perception. …",

      "title": "Too Cute for Words: Cuteness Evokes the Heartwarming Emotion of Kama Muta",
      "abstract": "A configuration of infantile attributes including a large head, large eyes, with a small nose and mouth low on the head comprise the visual baby schema or Kindchenschema that English speakers call \"cute.\" In contrast to the stimulus gestalt that evokes it, the evoked emotional response to cuteness has been little studied, perhaps because the emotion has no specific name in English, Norwegian, or German. We hypothesize that cuteness typically evokes kama muta, a social-relational emotion that in other contexts is often labeled in English as being moved or touched, heartwarming, nostalgia, patriotic feeling, being touched by the Spirit, the feels, etcetera. What evokes kama muta is sudden intensification of a communal sharing (CS) relationship, either CS between the person and another, or CS between observed others. In accord with kama muta theory, we hypothesize that a kama muta response to cuteness results from a sudden feeling of CS with the cute target. In colloquial terms, the perceiver adores the cute kittens and their heart goes out to them. When a person perceives cute targets interacting affectionately - that is, intensifying CS between them - this should strengthen a kama muta response. We experimentally investigated these predictions in two studies (N = 356). Study 1 revealed that videos of cute targets evoked significantly more kama muta than videos of targets that were not particularly cute. Study 2, pre-registered, found that, as hypothesized, when cute targets interacted affectionately they evoked more kama muta and were humanized more than when they were not interacting. We measured the level of kama muta by self-reports of sensations and signs and of feelings labeled heartwarming, being moved, and being touched. Participants' ratings of kama muta were positively correlated with reported cuteness. In addition, as in our previous research on kama muta elicited by other types of stimuli, trait empathic concern predicted kama muta responses and perceived cuteness. The studies thus provide first evidence that cute stimuli evoke the heartwarming emotion of kama muta.",

      "abstract": "The term <italic>empathy</italic> has been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including feeling what another person is feeling, understanding another person’s point of view, and imagining oneself in another person’s situation. However, perhaps the most widely researched phenomenon that goes by this label involves an other-oriented emotional state that is congruent with the perceived welfare of another person. The feelings associated with empathy include sympathy, tenderness, and warmth toward the other person. Other variations of empathic emotions have been investigated too, including empathic joy, empathic embarrassment, and empathic anger. The term altruism has also been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including any type of helping behavior, personality traits associated with helpful persons, and biological influences that spur protection of genetically related others. However, a particularly fruitful research tradition has focused on altruism as a motivational state with the ultimate goal of protecting or promoting the welfare of a valued other. For example, the empathy–altruism hypothesis claims that empathy (construed as an other-oriented emotional state) evokes altruism (construed as a motivational state). Empathy and altruism, regardless of how they are construed, have important consequences for understanding human behavior in general, and for understanding social relationships and well-being in particular.",

      "title": "Closing remarks",
      "abstract": "In this chapter I wish to summarize major themes, discuss some implications, and make bridges to related research agendas. As shown in the first chapter, laughter has long held fascination for those contemplating its nature, causes, functions, and meanings. Biological and ethological researchers demonstrate its close association with related primate behaviors and offer compelling theories of its origins in human communication and its evolutionary functions. The universality of laughter suggests a trans-situational, trans-cultural set of forms and meanings. It is universal that people produce laughter from the same finite set of phonemes and combinations thereof. It is universal that laughter connects to a finite set of facial expressions, breathing rhythms, and body movements. Laughter seems universally associated with feeling enjoyment, perceiving something as funny, or triumphing at other's misfortunes. However, this is not to say that all laughs appear the same, mean the same, or do the same work. Within these general parameters exists considerable latitude for variation in sound, sight, and feeling. As with all forms of human communicative behavior, laughter does far more than stand simply as outer display in any kind of pure mood–sign relation. It may be feigned; it may be done in order to experience certain feelings as well as occurring as a result of those feelings. Notions like “nervous” or “polite” laughter point to its doing other interactional work than simply expressing emotion.",

      "title": "Transformative Experiences",
      "abstract": "Transformative experiences are experiential states that radically alter a person in some way, such as what the person can know or understand, their core values or preferences, their overall outlook on the world, and so on. Notable historical examples plausibly include the Apostle Paul's epiphany and sudden conversion to Christianity on the road to Damascus, St. Augustine's moral and spiritual transformation after the death of a close friend, and similar transformations by the Buddha and Muhammed. Such experiences have been argued to pose philosophical challenges for rational choice, as it appears unclear how one can make rational life‐choices about experiences one does not understand or which otherwise fundamentally transform oneself or one's values. Some theorists argue that rational choices involving transformative experiences are impossible. Others argue that transformative experiences instead pose a challenge to making choices that are both rational and authentic. Others still are unconvinced that transformative experiences pose any serious or unique problems to rational choice, contending that the problems they present are either exaggerated or reducible to problems unrelated to transformative experience. Finally, many solutions have been advanced for resolving the problems that transformative experiences are alleged to pose, including that transformative experiences can be chosen for their own sake, chosen on the basis of objective evidence such as statistics and testimony, chosen on the basis of imaginative comparison to relevantly similar past experiences, or, alternatively, be rationally grappled with by the development of internal mastery such as personal resilience or through moral behavior.",

      "title": "18Boosting State Humility via Gratitude, Self-Affirmation, and Awe: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Humility is a psychological characteristic marked by a balanced, accurate \nself-concept and pronounced focus on other people rather than oneself \n(Tangney, 2000). We propose that humility is characterized by five hallmarks, \nor observable markers: (a) a secure and accepting self-identity; (b) freedom \nfrom distortion about one’s strengths and weaknesses; (c) openness to new \ninformation about oneself and the world; (d) high focus on others relative to \nthe self; and (e) a belief that other people are equally worthy (Chancellor & \nLyubomirsky, 2013). Each hallmark must be present, but none is individually sufficient for a person to be humble. These hallmarks thus both define \nhumility and differentiate it from what it is not. In particular, the opposite of \nhumility is high self-focus, including an excessively positive (e.g., narcissism \nor arrogance) or negative (e.g., depression or low self-esteem) self-view. Further, under this hallmarks-based definition, humility can be distinguished from \nmodesty. Although humble people are frequently modest, they may sometimes \nbehave immodestly when speaking frankly about their genuine strengths and \naccomplishments. Additionally, narcissistic individuals may behave outwardly \nmodestly for self-presentational purposes while maintaining an inwardly inflated \nself-worth. As such, humility is neither merely the absence of arrogance nor the \npresence of modesty.",

      "title": "Why the Radical Behaviorist Conception of Private Events is Interesting, Relevant, and Important",
      "abstract": "For radical behaviorists, talk about ―private events‖ could be about any of four things: (a) private behavioral events, (b) physiology, (c) dispositions, or (d) explanatory fictions. Talk about private events as behavioral engages the influence of feelings, sensations, and covert operant behavior. Analyses based on private behavioral events allow radical behaviorists to understand how those events contribute to contingencies controlling subsequent operant behavior, whether verbal or nonverbal. Talk about private events in physiological terms risks confounding explanatory categories. Although physiology necessarily participates in behavioral events, physiological events are not the same type as behavioral events, public or private. Rather, an organism's physiology is a material cause. To portray physiology as an autonomous, initiating cause, as traditional psychology often does, creates a variety of explanatory problems. Talk about private events as dispositions does not reflect anything literally private. Rather, dispositional talk reflects the probability of behavior engendered by contingencies. Dispositional talk is about effects, instead of causes or intervening variables as traditional psychology often portrays them. Finally, some talk ostensibly about private events is little more than an appeal to explanatory fictions. This talk, common in traditional psychology, owes its strength to the everyday social reinforcement inherent in ―folk psychology.‖ The talk represents a surrender to mentalism and methodological behaviorism, notwithstanding any claims that it is ―theoretical.‖",

      "abstract": "During social interactions, humans often unconsciously and unintentionally imitate the behaviors of others, which increases rapport, liking, and empathy between interaction partners. This effect is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that facilitates group living and may be shared with other primate species. Here, we show that capuchin monkeys, a highly social primate species, prefer human imitators over non-imitators in a variety of ways: The monkeys look longer at imitators, spend more time in proximity to imitators, and choose to interact more frequently with imitators in a token exchange task. These results demonstrate that imitation can promote affiliation in nonhuman primates. Behavior matching that leads to prosocial behaviors toward others may have been one of the mechanisms at the basis of altruistic behavioral tendencies in capuchins and in other primates, including humans.",

      "title": "MURDER WITHOUT APPARENT MOTIVE: A STUDY IN PERSONALITY DISORGANIZATION",
      "abstract": "In this paper we have described a number of common characteristics found in individuals who have committed impulsive senseless murders. These characteristics were: severe weakness of impulse control; blurring of the boundaries between fantasy and reality, with periods of altered states of consciousness; blunted and shallow emotional reactions; and a violent and primitive fantasy life. This constellation seems to have grown out of a history characterized by extreme parental violence and early severe emotional deprivation. In these cases, there appeared an ego weakness which allowed the periodic breakthrough of intense aggressive impulses, sometimes of homicidal proportion. When such apparently senseless murders occur, they are seen to be an end result of a period of increasing tension and disorganization in the murderer starting before the contact with the victim who, by fitting into the unconscious conflicts of the murderer, unwittingly serves to set into motion his homicidal potential. It remains a task of future research to: 1. Differentiate these individuals from other murderers as well as from others with similar disturbances but who do not kill; 2. Weigh the significance of the individual factors described; 3. Devise measures for identifying and effectively controlling these individuals before they commit murder.",

It examines under which conditions helping others can be adaptive, and which selection mechanisms were responsible. Next, the chapter discusses the causal mechanisms involved in proximate regulation while still focusing on nonhuman primates. Finally, it turns to human cooperation, using the same distinction between proximate and ultimate, but discusses humans in two separate sections: first foragers, who live in small-scale societies, and then people living in large-scale, anonymous societies.",

      "abstract": "It is emphasized, that by known reliable news it is appropriate to understand those, that fully correspond to the actual circumstances of the action (actions or inactions of an individual or a small group of people), events (actions or inactions of very large groups of people, when it is impossible to establish the role in achieving the overall result of each of participants, for example, in the course of the war, etc.) or phenomenon (action or inaction of the forces of nature, including predatory animals, that are in conditions not regulated by humans) in general or a certain part of it, and peculiarities of perception, memorization, their storage, reproduction and other transmissions by a certain person, including life experience or relevant special or professional competence contribute to the transmission or other disclosure of practically adequate news. Attention is focused on the fact, that according to the basic orientation of the result of their public disclosure, each of the named types of news can be divided into those, that condition their perception by the majority of addressees as positive, negative and positive-negative, and negative information – also as neutral, socially harmful and socially dangerous news, when the last two types of news, depending on the level of public danger as a result of their public disclosure, may create conditions for the recipients to commit relevant criminal and other offences.

Indeed, they should resist any attempt to take them as such on the grounds that seeing athletes (or other celebrities) as role models abrogates the existential and ethical responsibilities of both parties. Whether one takes on the role of being a model to others or whether one chooses to model one’s own behaviour on that of another, except in respect of the development of technical skill, one engages in bad faith and fails to act in an existentially ethical way. To this end, I consider the inclination to influence and admiration, as well as self‐respect, agency, motivation, and envy. I argue that while celebrity sportspersons and similar others do not have duties that others do not have just by virtue of their notoriety alone, they may have situational responsibilities commensurate with their social reach. More importantly, however, since social influence is not a transformation of inert matter, there are also responsibilities belonging to their audiences, those who merely observe and those who choose to imitate",

      "title": "Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book endorses an ecumenical naturalism toward all cognition, which will illuminate the long-recognized and striking similarities between features of mental disorders and features of religions. The authors emphasize underlying cognitive continuities between familiar features of religiosity, of mental disorders, and of everyday thinking and action. They contend that much religious thought and behavior can be explained in terms of the cultural activation of maturationally natural cognitive systems, which address fundamental problems of human survival, encompassing such capacities as hazard precautions, agency detection, language processing, and theory of mind. The associated skills are not taught and appear independent of general intelligence. Religions’ representations cue such systems’ operations. The authors hypothesize that in doing so they sometimes elicit responses that mimic features of cognition and conduct associated with mental disorders. Both in schizophrenia and in religions some people hear alien voices. The inability of depressed participants to communicate with or sense their religions’ powerful, caring gods can exacerbate their depression. Often religions can domesticate the concerns and compulsions of people with OCD. Religions’ rituals and pronouncements about moral thought-action fusion can temporarily evoke similar obsessions and compulsions in the general population. A chapter is devoted to each of these and to the exception that proves the rule. The authors argue that if autistic spectrum disorder involves theory-of mind-deficits, then people with ASD will lack intuitive insight and find inferences with many religious representations challenging. Ecumenical naturalism’s approach to mental abnormalities and religiosity promises both explanatory and therapeutic understanding.",

Children learn and develop quickly the ability to use semblances as the primary tool in their navigation of the social world, gaining affiliation through the debunking and deliberate creation of false or pseudo beliefs.

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Moral intelligence",
      "abstract": "We discuss the thesis that the implementation of a moral code in the behaviour of artificial intelligent systems needs a specific form of human and artificial intelligence, not just an abstract intelligence. We present intelligence as a system with an internal structure and the structural levels of the moral system, as well as certain characteristics of artificial intelligent agents which can/must be treated as 1- individual entities (with a complex, specialized, autonomous or selfdetermined, even unpredictable conduct), 2- entities endowed with diverse or even multiple intelligence forms, like moral intelligence, 3- open and, even, free-conduct performing systems (with specific, flexible and heuristic mechanisms and procedures of decision), 4 – systems which are open to education, not just to instruction, 5- entities with “lifegraphy”, not just “stategraphy”, 6- equipped not just with automatisms but with beliefs (cognitive and affective complexes), 7- capable even of reflection (“moral life” is a form of spiritual, not just of conscious activity), 8 – elements/members of some real (corporal or virtual) community, 9 – cultural beings: free conduct gives cultural value to the action of a ”natural” or artificial being. Implementation of such characteristics does not necessarily suppose efforts to design, construct and educate machines like human beings. The human moral code is irremediably imperfect: it is a morality of preference, of accountability (not of responsibility) and a morality of non-liberty, which cannot be remedied by the invention of ethical systems, by the circulation of ideal values and by ethical (even computing) education. But such an imperfect morality needs perfect instruments for its implementation: applications of special logic fields; efficient psychological (theoretical and technical) attainments to endow the machine not just with intelligence, but with conscience and even spirit; comprehensive technical means for supplementing the objective decision with a subjective one. Machine ethics can/will be of the highest quality because it will be derived from the sciences, modelled by techniques and accomplished by technologies. If our theoretical hypothesis about a specific moral intelligence, necessary for the implementation of an artificial moral conduct, is correct, then some theoretical and technical issues appear, but the following working hypotheses are possible: structural, functional and behavioural. The future of human and/or artificial morality is to be anticipated.",

Persons afflicted by disabilities are considered nonentities, useless or invalid persons.In such a way disability becomes synonymous with weakness, lack of security and total helplessness and a sense of pity develops towards ourselves and other afflicted people.In this article my purpose is to demostrate that disability is a personal election and that as disabled and handicapped people we have the capacity to teach persons in the same conditions, and to the whole world, that we are superior to our external appearance since we are ordinary human beings, despite of our difference. “Normal” or “complete” persons can as well suffer unfulfillment, dissatisfaction or functional differences leading to various emotional and spiritual difficulties to relate with other people.In my personal case disability has opened me to a different world that has been an element of personal and spiritual transformation.Key words: Deficiency, disability, decision.",

      "abstract": "Research on the structural features of people's most enduring regrets has focused on whether they result from having acted or having failed to act. Here we focus on a different structural feature, their connection to a person's self-concept. In 6 studies, we predict and find that people's most enduring regrets stem more often from discrepancies between their actual and ideal selves than their actual and ought selves. We also provide evidence that this asymmetry is at least partly due to differences in how people cope with regret. People are quicker to take steps to cope with failures to live up to their duties and responsibilities (ought-related regrets) than their failures to live up to their goals and aspirations (ideal-related regrets). As a consequence, ideal-related regrets are more likely to remain unresolved, leaving people more likely to regret not being all they could have been more than all they should have been.

      "abstract": "Within each human group there is a set of commonly understood symbols attached to every generally experienced form of behavior which places it somewhere along a continuum between aggression and assistance and which has no necessary connection with the actual nature of the behavior. A man with a sharp instrument may represent a doctor, a fellow play actor or an enemy. When a segment of a group reacts to the behavior of another segment, it chooses a behavior symbolizing, among other things, some degree of aggression or some degree of assistance. That one segment takes the trouble to respond to another segment is a sufficient indication that the responding segment hopes to achieve some particular value or set of values through its response. Hence, if an aggressive response is made to an aggressive behavior, thus initiating conflict, it can be assumed that calculation or experience have indicated that the communication of aggressive intent is most likely to lead to value realization. Because the behavior of any two segments of a group must be in sufficient conformity to reality to permit the survival of both, it can be assumed that the choice of conflict as a mode of interaction is ordinarily rational. In any group which survives over a period of time, it can be expected that interaction between individuals and subgroups within it will be patterned in such a way that conflict occurs only under specified conditions and within definite limits. Built into the cultural tradition must be rules of the game which maintain a balance of power and insure that the degree of conflict which develops does not interfere significantly with the realization of values.",

      "title": "LANGUAGE AND EMOTION: DISCOURSE-PRAGMATIC PERSPECTIVES",
      "abstract": "Some people might wonder if emotion has anything at all to do with language, or think that emotion cannot be a topic for serious scientific research.In fact, this has been a common belief for many years, even among linguists and other scholars.But fortunately, this was yesterday's news.Today's news is that emotion matters in every scientific field and in particular, in linguistics, because it is a key factor not only in understanding human nature, but also in the comprehension of human language and communication.Альба-Хуэс Л., Ларина Т.В.Вестник РУДН.Серия: ЛИНГВИСТИКА.2018.Т. 22. № 1. С. 9-37 10 Indeed, when people feel emotions they may not only show their internal states physically (e.g. by blushing or changing their facial expression), but also perform speech acts which are interpersonal in nature and have particular consequences.And by so doing speakers manifest, and at the same time affect, certain aspects of the cognitive, social and discourse systems they belong to.Indeed, emotion affects language and at the same time is affected by language: the way we feel may influence the way we talk and express those feelings, and at the same time, the way we name or talk about emotions can affect the way we feel such emotions.Perhaps nothing is more human than the verbal expression of emotion, for even though other animal species may express certain basic emotions in non-verbal ways, they certainly cannot talk about them (Alba-Juez & Mackenzie, 2016: 242).Sharing emotions is a crucial social activity which forms part of everyday conversation and interaction and helps us maintain both our mental and physical health.To express and understand these emotions appropriately is therefore important to interpersonal relationships and individual well-being (Fussell, 2002).Furthermore, it can be said that human emotion lies at the root of verbal communication.As Russian emotiologists suggest, in the beginning was not the Word, but the Emotion, because the basis of primary and secondary nominations from the very beginning were the emotions of a person, not yet Homo Loquens, but already Homo Sentiens (Shakhovsky 2008: 10).If we do not have the motivation to talk about something, our speech will most surely be very restricted (Foolen, 2015).As Stern (1965Stern ( [1931]]: 54) put it, \"If a thing were quite indifferent to me I would not say it\".Also, if a speaker feels that her interlocutor is not interested in what she is saying, it will be hard to continue speaking.Thus, emotion in communication works in both directions: not only the speaker has to have the motivation to speak, but the interlocutor should be willing (and therefore positively predisposed, showing a positive attitude) to listen; otherwise, communication will not take place.In the 20 th century, linguistics was mainly concerned with the referential function of language and the linguistic code per se.Language was seen as an abstract and logical instrument for dealing with factual information.The also true fact that language is strongly affected by and loaded with emotion was almost completely disregarded.But towards the end of the 20 th and beginning of the 21 st centuries, the world of scientific and humanistic research started to reflect upon the fact that language/discourse is much more than a code or some grammatical, morphological or phonological rules: the pragmatic, cognitive and emotive dimensions of human communication transcend the linguistic code, and this had to be reflected upon and shown in the research.Thus the world of linguistics geared towards what has now been called \"the emotional turn\" (Le Doux, 2000).Linguists started to study the phenomenon from a more objective, scientific point of view and thus came to the conclusion that indeed, as Ochs and Shieffeling had already pointed out back in 1989, \"language has a heart\".As several authors have now observed, emotion is undoubtedly a very important part of every kind of communication, and can be found at all the levels of linguistic description (Alba-Juez",

      "abstract": "Abstract While agent responsibility appears to be one of the clearest examples of a human distinctive, practices of holding responsible are bound up with social expectations and emotional reactions, many of which are shared with other social animals. This essay attends to the ways in which what Peter Strawson first identified as the reactive emotions, including notably anger, resentment, and indignation, are key to making sense of both the shared and distinctive features of responsible human agency. Like human beings, other social animals express a range of reactive emotions in response to others’ conformity with or violation of implicit social expectations and norms; human beings sometimes reflect on these reactive attitudes and their justifiability, asking whether and when it is appropriate to hold others accountable, blame, and/or punish them. We should recognize that we often praise and blame others for attitudes and desires which they have not chosen and over which they have no direct control, and that this is appropriate.",

Yet not every human being is a person (slaves are not, for example), and there are some non-human entities (such as corporations) which are. The legal category of the person is thus at once continuous and discontinuous with that of the natural person, designating a subject of rights and duties along a spectrum from full to very partial personhood. Moreover, the mode of being of natural persons is by no means self-evident, because the status of the “natural” person is itself constituted by a juridical demarcation of the boundaries of embodied human being and by distinct institutional and practical conditions of constitution, and natural persons are not necessarily coextensive with their bodies. While Western models of personhood are based on the coherence and continuity of the self as rational or ethical substance, quite different ways of understanding personhood are found in other cultures, where persons may be taken to be the sum of their social relations or of the exchange of substances between their bodies and the rest of the social and material world. Similarly, in most cultures persons are constituted by their relation to the generations of the dead from whom they inherit, to the gods, and to the unborn descendants to whom property and some of the components of kinship (a name, a status, a genetic inheritance) are to be passed on.",

      "abstract": "The concept of recognition (Anerkennung in German) has been in the center of intensive interest and debate for some time in social and political philosophy, as well as in Hegelscholarship. The first part of the article clarifies conceptually what recognition in the relevant sense arguably is. The second part explores one possible route for arguing that the ‘recognitive attitudes’ of respect and love have a necessary role in the coming about of the psychological capacities distinctive of persons. More exactly, it explores the possibility that they are necessary in the kind of intersubjective relationship in which normal human infants engage in the prelinguistic communicative practice of pointing things to others, as described by Michael Tomasello. If an incapacity to participate in the already Gricean communicative practices of pointing makes it also impossible for the infant to learn symbolic communication, and if without the immediately intrinsically motivating other-regarding attitudes of recognition communicative pointing does not get off the ground (at least among the most intelligent animals currently known to exist), then the capacity for recognition may be a decisive difference between humans and their closest nonhuman relatives. That is, it may be why only human infants, but no other animals, are capable of embarking on a developmental journey that normally leads to full-fledged psychological personhood. If this is so, then the concept of recognition, today mostly discussed in social and political philosophy and Hegel-studies, could turn out to be a very useful tool in cognitive scientific work interested in specifically human forms of social intentionality, cognition, volition and so forth.",

First, the research evidence strongly suggests that mental operations exist prior to language onset, conversation of gestures, or social interaction. Second, language is not just significant symbols; it requires syntax. Third, syntax seems to be part of our bioinheritance, that is, part of our presocial mind/brain—what Noam Chomsky has called our language faculty. Fourth, this means syntax probably is not learned nor a social construction that is internalized as a cultural template. Fifth, this suggests a basic reversal of the prevailing model of symbolic interaction, mind, language, and perhaps the self as well, although there has not been the time or space to engage that topic here. Therefore, symbolic interaction may turn out to be a more Chomskyan than Meadian process. Given the bioinheritance of our mind/brain we are able to engage in symbolic interaction; it does not appear that symbolic interaction creates our mind or the basic computational algorithms of language.",

We ask: can “good relationships” be observed, especially when the pair know each other well? We studied familiar/unfamiliar pairs, negotiating simple obstacles, to explore qualities of cooperation between pairs. Interviews with human participants elicited perceptions of horses’ “personalities” and reactions. We analyzed video recordings of interactions and also showed them to external observers. We identified differences in attention, tension and coordination: familiar pairs were more coordinated, mutually attentive, and less tense, and they showed less resistance.

      "title": "Edytorial: Samotność a kreacja",
      "abstract": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Reflecting on a possible positive dimension of loneliness in the context of creation, it is necessary to consider the ethical aspect. Being lonely should be understood as being separated, ‘self being’, without others or next to them. Why does an individual decide to be separated? A positive aspect of loneliness must be considered as a person’s independent decision. Being lonely against one’s will cannot be considered as a self-imposed act, as a positive dimension of loneliness. History, literature and religion provide numerous examples of creative and positive dimensions of loneliness, of being alone. However, loneliness in these examples means being lonely for a cause. Being lonely for a cause can be analysed within the ethical aspect. Sacrifice, devotion can also be considered here. On the other hand, contemporary transformations call for viewing loneliness from yet another perspective. Maybe it should be re-evaluated. Being lonely may not result from ‘bad luck’, wrong choices or a desire to sacrifice oneself, but from commonsensical calculations. I am alone because it is more convenient, more practical, it allows me to focus on my goals only. Modern societies do not require forming couples nor joining communities because one is a part of a huge web and may cooperate with others to obtain a particular aim without the necessity to abandon ‘one’s oneness’, one’s separation from others. Maybe such ‘oneness’ should be used as the term describing the contemporary world, in which being in a lasting relationship can be perceived as a nuisance, because it does not permit to form various co-operations in order to achieve various goals. The durability of being together, abandoning one’s distinctiveness may be perceived as something more and more anachronic. Even the traditional attitude to family life may undergo erosion. A futuristic vision of defining one’s share in being together may become a frequent occurrence. For example, who are full-time wives and husbands? Maybe, taking into account cultural and social transformations, it necessary to redefine the identity of marriage, of being a wife, a husband a parent. ‘Oneness’ in relation to a family life is only one aspect of transformations taking place nowadays. Loneliness can take various forms. New media, through which we get to know other people, can also become the source of alienation. Contacts obtained and maintained through them do not seem to be inconvenient in any way – one can always give them up. Zygmunt Bauman draws attention to a limited number of active relations, which does not exceed 150 persons . Thus, everyone can create his ‘own primal village’ with lively relations. This village is not geographically and spatially restricted, and its centrer is ‘me’. ‘Oneness’ will be the result of contemporary civilisation, in which relations are defined by subject’s creation. Everyone can create their own village and their own ethical standards resulting from an adopted philosophy of life. This issue of ‘Horizons of Education’ is devoted to multidimensional analysis of loneliness in the context of creation. Here the readers can find reflection on its psychological, philosophical, educational and semantic aspects. The issue opens with an article written by Beata Balogova and Martin Lacný. It deals with loneliness in the positive context of contemporary person’s social life and considers the meaning of life. The authors analyse experiencing difficult life situations resulting in post-traumatic stress. The experience of such stress offers to an individual a higher quality of life with greater resilience, the result of which is a new dimension of life, a new meaning of life. The articles written by Wieslaw Wojcik and Marek Rembierz also seem interesting: they focus on loneliness in intellectual activities, which require a lot of intellectual effort. Intellectual effort flourishes on loneliness, requires unlimited time, uses it up but gives joy in return. Loneliness of a creator, a genius can yield wonderful fruit. Janusz Miąso discusses the issue of interpersonal communication in the context of loneliness. According to him, at the beginning there is no loneliness but intrapersonal communication, which transform loneliness into a desire for interpersonal communication. Experiencing another human being leads back to one’s inside, where one experiences, enriches and enhances a desire to turn to others becoming permanently more creative. Marek Studenski writes about loneliness with reference to the life of priests and consecrated people. He believes that experiencing loneliness in a creative way is a chance but also a source of problems which might be difficult to overcome. Difficulties faced by priests or monks are often completely different from the ones imagined by those preparing for such life. The necessity to face situations which must be accepted and experienced after the formation period reveal the validity of the decision taken. Bozena Sieradzka-Baziur analyses a semantic dimension of the concept of loneliness. She points at three thematic categories: social contacts, emotions and the number and quantity. Language users assign various, unlimited in number, language signs to those three categories. It results from the fact that languages are alive, they develop and undergo changes together with their users. In her considerations on loneliness, Joanna Sztuka presents volunteering as an active form of adaptation to old age and the strategy of coping with this period of human life. She points at the fact that from a pedagogical perspective, the elderly can and should constitute an important link of the social capital. Thematic considerations on loneliness in this issue of ‘Horizons of Educations’ end with the article written by Justyna Kusztal. We strongly recommend those highly interesting reflections on creative aspects of loneliness. The authors from various academic centres in Poland and abroad have contributed material which is definitely worth thinking over. It should be noticed that loneliness is also closely connected with ethical considerations, as the essence of ethical struggle is to reveal the art of life.",

      "abstract": "As humans, of course, we help each other, every day we meet humans, do joint activities, and communicate directly. An activity that we never miss is communication, without communication, we cannot know what he wants and vice versa he does not know what we want. When communicating, it must also be clear about the intentions and goals that we will convey, using good and clear language so that there is no miss communication, but in contrast to speech impaired cannot speak clearly and maybe the language said by speech impaired cannot be understood by us, the way that is often used by speech impaired is to use sign language or body language. The body language used when communicating with the community is also natural body language or the language can be understood by speech impaired and the community. Most of the speech impaired are deaf so when talking to speech impaired people do not need to make excessive noises enough with clear lip movements because speech impaired people when communicating will focus on the movement of the lips. The purpose of this study is to find out how to communicate speech impaired with the community in their environment and whether people with speech impairments with the community do not have obstacles when communicating. This research method uses a qualitative approach by obese dating the intended object, namely speech impairment, and the community.",

As a result, the term has acquired varied meanings. This analysis of novelty makes four claims. First, the specific state of uncertainty that a novel event creates depends on its origin. Second, unexpected events that alter the immediate stimulus surround (called stimulus novelty) should be distinguished from those that are inconsistent with an agent's long term knowledge (called conceptual novelty). Third, the critical features that render an event novel can vary with the agent's intention to classify or to act on an object and the balance between these two frames changes with development. Finally, the state of uncertainty created when an agent must choose one response from two or more alternatives differs from the states provoked by stimulus and conceptual novelty.",

      "title": "The invisibility cloak illusion: People (incorrectly) believe they observe others more than others observe them.",
      "abstract": "Whether at a coffee shop, in a waiting room, or riding the bus, people frequently observe the other people around them. Yet they often fail to realize how much other people engage in the same behavior, and that they, therefore, also are being observed. Because it is logically impossible that people, on average, are the subjects of observation more than they are objects of it, the belief that one watches others more than one is watched is an illusion. Several studies show that people incorrectly believe that they observe others more than other people observe them. We call this mistaken belief the \"invisibility cloak illusion.\" People believe that they observe others more than do other people and that they are generally observed less than are others (Studies 1-3, 5, 6). The illusion persists both among strangers in the same vicinity (Study 2) and among friends interacting with one another (Study 3), and it cannot be explained away as yet another general better-than-average bias nor is it the result of believing one has more thoughts, in general, than do other people (Studies 2-3). The illusion is supported by a failure to catch others watching oneself (Studies 1b, 4) and it is manifest in the specific contents of people's thoughts about one another (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, rendering a feature of one's appearance salient to oneself fails to interrupt the illusion despite increasing one's belief that others are paying more attention specifically to that salient feature (Study 6).

      "title": "An S-shaped pattern in the perceived passage of time: how social interaction governs temporal experience",
      "abstract": "abstract Variation in the passage of time is perceived against the backdrop of standard temporal units. Under certain conditions, we perceive time to be passing slowly. In other settings, our subjective temporal experience is roughly synchronized with the objective time of clocks or calendars. And given different circumstances, we perceive time to have passed quickly. Drawing from 740 narratives that depict distortion in the perceived passage of time, I formulate a theory that accounts for the full range of variation in temporal experience. This theory can be represented by an S-shaped figure. According to this theory, variation in the perceived passage of time reflects variation in the density of experience per standard temporal unit. In turn, the density of experience per standard temporal unit is conditioned by the dynamics of social interaction. In its original form, however, this theory assumes that one’s circumstances shape one’s temporal experience in deterministic fashion. Consequently, based upon interviews with 406 disparate people, I conceptualize time work (or temporal agency) as one’s efforts to control, manipulate, or customize one’s own temporal experience or that of others. I conclude with some directions for future research.",

Animal experiments also demonstrate the devastating effects of stressful unpredictabilities.

In the first case alterity is in the involuntary dimension of ourselves, our un-chosen ‘character’, including needs, desires, emotions, and habits.

Dialogue is a kind of ‘experience’: it is not merely a verbal exchange, an exchange of information; rather, dialogue <italic>lets something happen</italic>. What emerges in dialogue is neither mine nor yours, and hence transcends the interlocutors’ subjective opinions.

      "abstract": "Much has been said and written on loneliness, which is a common human phenomenon that belongs to everyday existence, but few attempts have been made to capture the phenomenon and its existential meaning without reducing its complexity. This paper addresses the question: What is loneliness, what is its essence? The study practiced a phenomenological approach, called Reflective Lifeworld Research. Twenty-six interviews were analysed for meaning with the aim of describing an essential structure for the phenomenon, showing what loneliness is. The analysis shows that the phenomenon of loneliness stands out in meaning as “figure” against a “background” of fellowship, connectedness and context. One is lonely when important others are not there, because either one has rejected them or they have chosen to be rejected and left the person behind, feeling lonely. One can reject others in favour of another kind of connectedness. Such loneliness is restful and pleasant. It involves the lack of tangible context that other present people can offer, yet a context is not missing—in this instance there is a relationship to and one is part of something else such as nature or animal fellowship. Involuntary loneliness on the other hand involves a lack of context and connectedness. To be involuntarily lonely and not belonging to anyone is to lack participation in the world. To not be. Loneliness as a phenomenon is further characterized as transcending the present situation containing loneliness. One can feel lonely even if there are many people around, or one can be completely alone without feeling lonely. Loneliness can disappear with a sense of belonging, when one connects with someone who is miles away.",

Experience is now constituted differently; the world of perception, conception, imagination, and thought has an altered foundation, a new configuration.

      "abstract": "Abstract Animals are usually considered to lack the status of autonomous agents. Nevertheless, they do appear to make ostensible choices. This article considers whether, and how, I should respect animals' choices. I propose a concept of volitionality which can be respected if, and insofar as, doing so is in the best interests of the animal. Applying that concept, I (we) will argue that an animals' choices be respected when the relevant human decision maker's capacities to decide are potentially challenged or compromised. For example, it will be best to respect the animals' choice when the human decision maker: (1) lacks accurate knowledge of the animal's subjective experiences; (2) does not know what will lead to desirable experiences or allow for the avoidance of undesirable ones; (3) is biased; (4) is less aware of the animal's specific situation; (5) cannot appreciate all elements comprehensively, including considering any (content‐neutral) value to the animal being allowed to make and implement a choice, such as where a lack of control or liberty would be unpleasant or where an animal would usefully learn from the process of choice‐making; and (6) when the animal's choice is achievable. This additionally suggests that we may often beneficially choose to set up situations that empower animals to make better choices.",

      "abstract": "One important element in the definition and understanding of the dynamics of interethnic or intergroup relations generally is the attitude which prevails among the particular ethnic groups who are in a contact situation. Attitude formation is a function of the experiences acquired and the opinions formed by the parties to the social contact. For the latter two by their nature are a necessary precondition of the former. Put another way, experience in a social situation and the judgement arrived at as being true and derivable from that experience either intellectually or otherwise (for this essentially is what constitutes opinion) must take place before attitude occurs. Attitude essentially is an acquired, or learned, and established tendency of an individual to react toward or against something or somebody. It does not, we must warn, refer to any one specific act or response of an individual, but is an abstraction from a large number of consistent, related acts or responses of the person to an object or people (Green 1954, p. 336). An attitude may be characteristic of a person (and as such relate to the given person) or to other persons or to social groups or to society. It may even be social in the sense that is characteristic of a homogeneous group of persons. The place of attitude in intergroup dynamics cannot be overemphasised. For it determines whether or not group members accept one another and a condition of harmony, integration, intergroup wholesome or unwholesome competition or rivalry exist among them. It also determines whether a condition of stability or instability obtains in the overall society in which the contacting groups are active participants in the socioeconomic lives. A group characterised by favourable attitudes toward another group would most probably accept the members of that group. And if acceptance is achieved, an important milestone is reached in the harmonious relations between the groups and in a condition of stability characterised by a minimum of antagonism. And man, it is said, functions fully, effectively under a condition of stability when his potentials are maximised and are fully released or expressed and utilised because of the existing security.",

The figurative use of language, then, results in shifts of meaning.

It is claimed to be a central element in word learning, by which a child comes to realize that the object in question is named or described by an interlocutor's words. It is also considered an important diagnostic for the child's growing awareness of another's “mind,” capable of attention distinct from the child's own. The complexities of joint attention in human interaction, however, extend well beyond such a static and limited canonical case, to include other sensory modalities, involving attention over sometimes extended time spans, and implying transformations and reconstruals of the “object” attended to, including its possible conjoint and collaborative constitution by multiple participants through different linguistic modalities, including sign language.",

      "abstract": "At The present time, reason is not held in any too great esteem; “rationalism” is deprecated in most intellectual circles. “To believe in reason” is to be behind the times, to give evidence of a mode of thinking that is out of date, out of contact with what today is called “progress.” The “belief in reason” is now replaced by all sorts of psychological and sociological sciences: the psychology of the unconscious, of the subconscious, of behavior, of suppressed desires and conditioned reflexes. The variety of sociologies is no less disconcerting—not should we forget the sociological psychologies and the psychological sociologies. Formerly man was considered to be an animal rationale , a rational being; now he has become simply a vital being, not further qualified. Since man lives in community with his fellows, it was formerly the practice to inquire into the structure and organization which society ought to have in order to correspond to the rational and human nature of its members. But today no such question is raised; it is taken for granted that man, as a social animal, must adjust himself to his environment or suffer the consequence to his well-being and his happiness. It is no longer a question of whether one may or one should adjust oneself to certain social conditions: it is now only a question of what is the most effective means or technique of adjustment.",

      "abstract": "Humans create social closeness with one another through a variety of shared social activities in which they align their emotions or mental states towards an external stimulus such as dancing to music together, playing board games together or even engaging in minimal shared experiences such as watching a movie together. Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (Study 1) and a conspecific (Study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster or spend more time in their proximity than when they had attended to something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is present in both humans and great apes and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected.",

      "abstract": "Situations where individuals have to contribute to joint efforts or share scarce resources are ubiquitous. Yet, without proper mechanisms to ensure cooperation, the evolutionary pressure to maximize individual success tends to create a tragedy of the commons (such as over-fishing or the destruction of our environment). This contribution addresses a number of related puzzles of human with an evolutionary game theoretical approach as it has been successfully used to explain the of other biological species many times, from bacteria to vertebrates. Our agent-based model distinguishes individuals applying four different behavioral strategies: non-cooperative individuals (defectors), cooperative individuals abstaining from punishment efforts (called or second-order free-riders), cooperators who punish non-cooperative (moralists), and defectors, who punish other defectors despite being non-cooperative themselves (immoralists). By considering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model reveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate cooperators. This spreading of punishing requires a segregation of behavioral strategies and solves the second-order free-rider problem. Second, the system changes its character significantly even after very long times (who laughs last laughs best effect). Third, the presence of a number of defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing cooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists in a way that appears like an unholy collaboration. Our findings suggest that the consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the establishment and spreading of moral behavior by means of game-theoretical concepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches are powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical concepts so far. The complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomes understandable as result of an evolutionary competition between different behavioral strategies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTORY communication textbooks almost all have some model of the communication process. These models usually include a source, or sender, as well as a message, a channel, and a Sometimes noise is included in the model. There are many different ways to draw lines between these entities, not just the straight lines of the classic Shannon-Weaver model of telephone systems. We study these models diligently, teach them to students, and take them for granted. But who is the in a communication interaction? The answer is by no means clear. Ordinarily we assume that a person is the source of communication in interpersonal situations. Likewise another person is the receiver. However, we also know that our persons get constructed within communication situations. So the person is not a fixed entity, as the models would imply. Depending on the communication interaction, the person may change. The study of communication here begins to delve into the thorny questions usually reserved for psychologists. Is there just one person? Are persons really aggregates of different, loosely related behavior tendencies? And so on. In fact, the person begins to look suspiciously like a metaphor--an often unexamined one. wish to avoid these thickets here, and remain on a personal level. Let me tell a story about myself. was teaching a class near the end of the semester. The schedule of final exams was being discussed. offered my students the option of taking the final with a different section of the same course, which had a better exam time. As the discussion meandered around different issues, one young lady said, I have two finals scheduled at exactly the same time. What should do? Immediately said, I think in that situation, you are expected to commit suicide. There was a second of silence, then people laughed loudly. thought to myself, Where did that come from? As often happens with classroom humor, had to make sure nobody's feelings were hurt. immediately said to the young lady, I'm just kidding, you know ... just kidding. then advised she speak to her professors, and offered to help by letting her take her final at yet a different time with me. She seemed mollified, and the discussion went on. got no negative feedback about my offhand joke. This incident stuck in my mind, because really did not know where the remark came from. What was the of that jibe? Ordinarily do not joke about suicide; in fact teach that such joking is painful and hurtful to others. The remark just appeared, completely unpremeditated. Perhaps was responding to some note of desperation in the young lady's voice that seemed to me a little excessive. Yet much of our communication is spontaneous, unpremeditated. We respond to nonverbal impressions and emotional associations. In a good discussion, we do not know what direction it will lead. Communication between people is creative in its enactment. So what is the of this creative communication? Let us look inward for a moment, beyond easy metaphors of a person. meditate occasionally, and have great respect for Eastern traditions which have developed methods and vocabularies for stilling the activities of the mind. have noticed common threads in the Hindu and Buddhist writings about meditation. …",

      "abstract": "Human communication is multimodal in nature. In a normal environment, people use to interact with other humans and with the environment using more than one modality or medium of communication. They speak, use gestures and look at things to interact with nature and other humans. By listening to the different voice tones, looking at face gazes, and arm movements people understand communication cues. A discussion with two people will be in vocal communication, hand gestures, head gestures, and facial cues, etc. [1]. If textbook definition is considered synergistic use of these interaction methods is known as multimodal interaction [2]. For example, , a wheelchair user might instruct the smart wheelchair or the assistant to go forward, as shown in Fig. 1(a). However, with a hand gesture shown in the figure, he or she might want to go slowly. In the same way as of Fig. 1(b), a person might give someone a direction with a vocal command ‘that way’ and gesture the direction with his or her hand. In most Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) developments, there is an assumption that human interactions are unimodal. This forces the researchers to ignore the information other modalities carry with them. Therefore, it would provide an additional dimension for interpretation of human robot interactions. This article provides a concise description of how to adapt the concept of multimodal interaction in human-robot applications.",

It's important to recognize, that our nonverbal communication, our facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, posture, and tone of voice speak the loudest.

All of our nonverbal behaviors—the gestures we make, how close we stand, the way we sit, how much eye contact we make, how fast or how loud we talk send strong messages. These messages don't stop even when we stop speaking. We still communicate nonverbally. Oftentimes, what comes out of our mouths and what we communicate through our body language are two totally different things.When listener is faced with these mixed signals, he has to choose whether to believe our verbal or nonverbal message, and, in most cases, they're going to choose the nonverbal because it's a natural, unconscious language that broadcasts our true feelings and intentions in any given moment. The ability to understand and use nonverbal communication, or body language, is a powerful tool that can help us connect with others, express what we really mean, and build better relationships.",

A man who takes up a system of divinity with a previous opinion, that either every part must be true, or the whole false, approaches the discussion with great disadvantage. No other system, which is founded upon moral evidence, would bear to be treated in the same manner. Nevertheless, in a certain degree, we are all introduced to our religious studies under this prejudication. And it cannot be avoided. The weakness of the human judgement in the early part of youth, yet its extreme susceptibility of impression, renders it necessary to furnish it with some opinions, and with some principles or other. Or indeed, without much express care, or much endeavour for this purpose, the tendency of the mind of man to assimilate itself to the habits of thinking and speaking which prevail around him, produces the same effect. That indifferency and suspense, that waiting and equilibrium of the judgement, which some require in religious matters, and which some would wish to be aimed at in the conduct of education, are impossible to be preserved. They are not given to the condition of human life.",

What is the relationship between such actions and our capacities for rational agency? I take this to be a question about responsibility in a particular use of that term, which I shall call ‘responsibility 2 ’. We are not responsible 2 for all our intentional actions (actions under hypnosis, for example), but we can nevertheless be responsible 2 for actions we do not adequately control, for negligent actions, and for non‐intentional omissions. Appreciating this helps show that familiar principles of responsibility are false: those which delimit responsibility to intentional actions or to actions and outcomes under our control. In the attempt to fashion an alternative principle, cases of negligence prove pivotal. We hold ourselves and others responsible 2 for conduct within our respective ‘domains of secure competence’, (i.e. that within which we are confident of doing what we set ourselves to do, barring events which defeat our competence), even when actions within that domain fail. The significance of this practice of holding ourselves and others responsible 2 lies in the way it maintains our sense of who we are and of how we are related to the world in which we act. 1",

      "abstract": "Abstract Significant feelings of mental contamination, and the associated compulsions, are generated by physical or psychological violation. The effects of significant violations include fear, avoidance, anger, and in many instances a desire to retaliate. The primary contaminant is a person, and anything associated with the violator—people, places, or objects—can generate disturbing feelings of internal dirtiness and a desire to wash away the contamination. Compulsive washing tends to be futile in cases of mental contamination because the site of the dirtiness is inaccessible. In cases of physical violation the precipitating event is clear. For example, the victim recognizes the emergence of feelings of dirtiness and contamination after a sexual assault. Mental contamination is common after sexual assaults and the sense of pollution can persist for years. In cases of psychological violation, however, the link between the event/s and the emergence of mental contamination is obscure and perplexing. Betrayals, humiliation, and degradation can be traumatic even though “no skin is broken. Surges of feelings of mental contamination, are provoked by mental events such as intrusive images, memories, and thoughts, and also by secondary sources of contamination (people or places associated with the violator). Cognitive behavior therapy is the treatment of choice in cases of mental contamination which develop after psychological violation. In cases that develop after a physical violation the cognitive therapy is supplemented by techniques used for treating PTSD. Treated cases are described.",

      "abstract": "Why do we care so much for friends, even making sacrifices for them they cannot repay or never know about? When organisms engage in reciprocity, they have a stake in their partner's survival and wellbeing so the reciprocal relationship can persist. This stake (aka fitness interdependence) makes organisms willing to help beyond the existing reciprocal arrangement (e.g. anonymously). I demonstrate this with two mathematical models in which organisms play a prisoner's dilemma, and where helping keeps their partner alive and well. Both models shows that reciprocity creates a stake in partners' welfare: those who help a cooperative partner––even when anonymous––do better than those who do not, because they keep that cooperative partner in good enough condition to continue the reciprocal relationship. ‘Machiavellian' cooperators, who defect when anonymous, do worse because their partners become incapacitated. This work highlights the fact that reciprocity and stake are not separate evolutionary processes, but are inherently linked.",

      "abstract": "Potential competing interests: No potential competing interests to declare.Freud (1894) defined \"psychological projection\" as a defense mechanism in which one attributes negative aspects of their personality to others and is thus able to ignore their own flaws and problems.Its inverse form is defined as follows: when a person repeatedly (sometimes angrily) advises another person to ignore or pay no attention to either someone or something, it is usually because the person who advises this is experiencing inverse psychological projection; that is, if this person's needs have been disregarded in the past, their experience will be reflected in their reaction to the person they advise.However, such advice is relevant only when the type of hurt is a very specific case of banal mockery.If a mentally ill person tells somebody they are ugly, the best advice is to ignore them.However, if this person hurts someone in a way that has nothing to do with banal mockery of self-image (e.g., public humiliation, contempt, invasion of privacy, incitement, threatening behavior, discrimination, abuse, sexual or ordinary harassment, violence, annoyance) or if what was said had already hurt the other, then advising them to ignore or pay no attention to that mentally ill person disregards this damage.This defense mechanism can be activated in a person if they have been unable to cope with similar types of hurt in their own past and have been exposed to related mental damage, if their egoism is stimulated by the same matter, or if, due to this stimulation, it is either shameful for them to acknowledge their egoism because stimulated (or vulnerable) egoism is considered socially inferior or difficult for them to contain the other's hurt feelings or bruised egoism.Consequently, they deny the problem's existence and thus advise others to also ignore it due to their will to either stimulate (and unburden) their antagonism to others or to demonstrate their ability to rise above the same issue and \"win\" against it.Moreover, in contrast to classic psychological projection, in which a person attributes negative aspects of their own personality to others when they are unable to deal with these aspects (so they can ignore them), in its inverse form, a person attributes the quality that they would like to but cannot demonstrate/be able to succeed in (which relates to their ability to efficiently manage things or problems that stimulate their own egoism), so they can avoid dealing with these things or problems.In similar scenarios, inverse psychological projection may include saying things such as \"I don't care what you think (or say)/Who cares what people think (or say),\" \"Don't get excited by the background noise,\" I will not stoop to your level,\" \"Don't let them influence you,\" \"Don't give them the satisfaction,\" \"Don't give them a platform,\" \"They aren't worth it,\" or \"What do you expect from him?\" (one must distinguish between \"expected to\" and \"predicted to\" as these two possess different responsibilities).Alternatively, when discussing a television show, one may say, \"Who even watches it?\"and in",

      "abstract": "I argue that the capacity of the human mind to understand and use signs with arbitrary relations between signifier and signified emerged with abstract signs that signify an irreversibly ‘absent’ (used as a noun here), or the absence of an earlier presence. The cognitive capacity, relevant for religiously relevant perceptions, could probably have emerged in the Early Upper Paleolithic era (c. 50.000–40.000 BP). Abstract signs allowed humans to refer to a dead human, a permanent ‘absentee,’ or simply, an ‘absent’ – a certain former member of the group. Thus, they signify absence of a formerly present individual, and allow to externalize complex emotions. These abstract sings for absence, possibly rocks and stones, and respective emotions such as collective mourning became on their part, it is argued, the basis for religious perceptions such as memorial practices.",

Altruism focuses also on the network that emphasizes the helping agent's awareness of the need of another and the intention to be of assistance rather than the network favored by behavioral biologists that refers only to behaviors of an agent that benefit another. The concept of love refers to an emotional state rather than to an intention, action, or moral judgment.

      "abstract": "Co-Adaptation of Assistive Mobility Devices and Residential Functions Thomas Bock, Thomas Linner, Christos Georgoulas Abstract: Purpose For facilitating an independent living for elderly or disabled people, a method has been developed at TUM Building Realization and Robotics Lab, which aims at creating intelligent living environments by adjusting mobility sys-tems and everyday objects (e.g. appliances) as modular and complementary subsystems1. The proposed system com-prises an intelligent wheelchair, which enables simplified use of the bath-room, kitchen and living room, etc. It can dock at certain functions, e.g. the toilet, both on a physical and information technology level. Method Studies show that the major problem for people with physical and/ or cognitive disabilities in everyday routine and in managing the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is the surmounting of different height levels and distances. Even for a person with a good physical fitness, it is extremely difficult or even impossible to transfer from a wheelchair onto a couch autonomously. The reason is the height difference between the furniture and wheelchair, as well as the space or gap that occurs mostly between the transport device and the piece of furniture. The proposed work presents a thorough research study, which enabled a huge gain in knowledge, concerning the re-design of household appliances and devices, in order for them to be straight-forwardly and cost effectively integrated with mobility supporting robots2. The outcome of this research, led to the partici-pation on a research project which involves 7 companies and 3 universities. In order to realize the co-adaptation of an assistive mobility device and residential functions, the following development approach steps were followed: i) research and identification of needs, ii) definition of requirements, iii) identification of technologies and processes, iv) initial con-cept, v) experiment in real environment, vi) final concept and further development roadmap. Results & Discussion Most wheelchairs are designed with a fixed height and do not provide features for altering their elevation level. Addition-ally, handicapped individuals face major problems when reaching items located higher, due to the fact that objects in the environment are mostly located statically, and it is difficult to get at them as a disabled user. Especially for disabled peo-ple, the functions should come to them instead of the other way around. The results of the study prove that the co-adaptation of assistive mobility devices3 with various residential functions, allow the complexity reduction of mobility robots. Companies notice a huge potential in such an approach, as it would allow them to design less complex, and thus more cost effective robots for ADLs use. The high cost of robots is currently one of the main obstacles for deploying them in the home environment. Based on this study, TUM was finally able to set up a government funded 3-year R&D project (total funding cost: 3.9 Million , starting from June 2012) where major strategies, processes and components necessary to achieve uninterrupted mobility chains for elderly people will be brought to product market level.

El resultado final de la sobreexposición a glucocorticoides se refleja en la alteración de los sistemas corporales con hiperglucemia, hipertensión, infecciones recurrentes, alteración de la memoria y del control del comportamiento. Reconocer los eventos que pueden estresar a los animales domésticos no es sencillo. Mientras que algunos desencadenantes de estrés son fácilmente reconocidos por el hombre (temperaturas extremas, falta de alimentos, lesiones severas) otros pueden pasar desapercibidos (territorio, relaciones sociales, motivaciones, olores y sonidos). Por otra parte, se reconoce que la habituación a la especie humana en edad temprana es indispensable para una buena relación humano-animal, más aún, el ambiente humano puede ser percibido como un factor estresante en sí mismo.",

      "title": "The Semantics of -ketun in Korean",
      "abstract": "The conditional connective -ketun in Korean has some restrictions in both the antecedent clause and the consequent clause. In the antecedent clause the event or state denoted by the predicate must be perceptible. There are some exceptions to this restriction. The exceptional cases are where the event or state denotes a personal feeling on the part of the addressee (or addresser, in some cases). From these observations, it is concluded that the antecedent clause must be an event or state which can be directly experienced by the addressee (or, addresser). In the consequent clause, the mood must be imperative, hortative or promissive. When the mood is declarative or interrogative, the modality must be volitional. These moods or modality can be characterized as something that can be satisfied by some action on the part of the addresser or addressee. The relation between these two restrictions is that the antecedent clause changes the knowledge state of the addresser or addressee based on direct experience of something, and the addresser or addressee sets a goal and a plan for achieving the goal. And the consequent clause is an action included in the plan. This is the basic semantics of the conditional connective -ketun. I give a more specific representation of this semantics in this paper.",

Each actuality belonging to an experience is in coordinative proportionality to the preceding and succeeding ones, i.e. in kinesthetic (position), static (strength) and topic (direction) proportionality; as a result, the individual successive stages of each experience are related to one another and, in addition, the start and end stages of each experience to the end stage of the previous one or the start stage of the next one in a coordinative way, specific to each. Like the total actuality, their coordinative symbol components are specific (corresponding to the coordinative adjustments of the actual thought cell); so the structure of each experience is also specific; it corresponds to the associative series of the actual thought cells (to the structure) and thus to the constitution of the experiencing individual, which can also be called its structure. The hunger actualities are arranged in a wide circle and the anxiety actualities in a narrower one; pain actualities are in twists, sorrow actualities are in short straight lines and joy actualities in long ones.

      "abstract": "Disgust has been hypothesized to be uniquely linked to violations of a distinct moral domain (called divinity, purity, or sacred) aimed at preserving one's body from contamination with pathogens and preserving one's soul from violations of what is sacred. Here we examined whether the same emotion-core disgust-occurs when witnessing both types of violation, and we proposed a specific method for doing so. In two studies (N = 160; 240), American and Indian participants indicated their emotional reaction to (stories depicting) sacred or nonsacred violations, each either with or without pathogens. Both Americans and Indians felt \"grossed out\" (a term for core disgust) by events with pathogens (whether violations of the sacred or not). They felt disgusted and angered, but not grossed out, by violations of the sacred. For both Americans and Indians, grossed out was never the modal emotion when a sacred violation did not involve pathogens. Results were inconsistent with a focus on any single emotion: sacred violations were associated with several different negative emotions.

      "abstract": "Abstract Self-transcendence is the process by which a person becomes aware of their participation in something greater than their individual self. The conscious realization of participation in something beyond yourself, such as union with nature, humanity, or God, evokes positive emotions, particularly joy and awe, which are often combined with attitudes of humility and reverence. The cultivation of self-transcendence provides a coherent perspective on living that promotes physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. If we accept that virtue involves respect for the dignity of others and not just one’s individual self, then the cultivation of self-transcendence is essential to all aspects of virtue. In this chapter, we provide several lines of empirical evidence about human nature, ecological systems, well-being, and virtue that provide a solid foundation to guide clinical practice in promoting health. Prospective studies indicate that the cultivation of self-transcendence and well-being involves the dynamic interplay of three processes: the awakening of plasticity (i.e., being able and willing to change); virtue (i.e., having intuitive insight into what is good for a person’s self and others); and creative functioning (i.e., being innovative, purposeful and responsible so that our habits are congruent with our goals and values). The cultivation of self-transcendence by these three processes describes the essential features of the path to a life that is healthy, happy, and good. We describe evidence-based practices that are effective in motivating people to create opportunities for their own well-being and that of others by cultivating self-transcendence.",

      "title": "Perspective on Ethics: The Elephant in the Room",
      "abstract": "While the field of bioethics is increasingly equated with medicine and healthcare, the purview of bioethics actually includes human interaction with all things biological—whether those interactions are with other humans, other sentient and non-sentient entities, even the very earth itself, since it is, after all, one of those necessary conditions for the very possibility of our existence. Much like our cohorts in medicine and healthcare, those of us currently laboring in the field of bioethics pay lip-service to the importance of developing at least a biopsychosocial—if not also environmental —perspective when addressing problems or issues. But when advocating for such an “all-things-considered” perspective we, again like our cohorts in medicine and healthcare, tend to ignore the material conditions, the biological, psychological, social and the environmental, that actually spawn and/or aggravate the complex, chronically occurring, and broadly (though often subtly) interconnected problems or issues we address. This leads to a myopia, it prevents us from being able to helping to identify the broadest range of possible solutions to the problems we focus on, or in some cases the consequences of our proposed solutions. A case in point: bioethicists continue to stress the importance of autonomy while, at the same time, we fail to point out how basic economic and political arrangements actually set the framework for any meaningful understanding of autonomy to occur. Take, for example, the increasing availability of insurance-subsidized IVF in the US, a nation where the official poverty rate in 2009 was 14.3 percent (20.7% for children under 18 years of age), and where the percentage of people without health insurance coverage increased from 15.4 percent to 16.7 percent over the same period.1 What does autonomy effectively mean for the couple seeking IVF? For the child in poverty? For the person without health insurance? They all live in the same country, under much the same social or political arrangements, arrangements that have helped to create and now perpetuate the ability of some to fulfill not only their basic needs, along with their wants and desires. Yet at the same time, many of their basic needs will go unmet. Loosely paraphrasing John Dewey, we might ask how a country that hoists the banner of the ideal, autonomy in this instance, can march in the direction of continual disregard concerning not only such basic inequities, but also such pressing issues as overpopulation, pollution on a global scale, global warming, the likely extinction of various flora and fauna. All of these things drastically impinge on the longterm robust autonomy of all for what might be the very short-term benefit of a select few.2 Autonomy has rightly become the backbone of discussions in bioethics in the US. But we might now initiate meaningful discussion about what that autonomy means and how best to secure it. This would move us past the thought that autonomy is an abstract ideal, and towards the idea that it can reveal a reality lived, not just by some, but every biologically, psychologically, socially and environmentally situated self.",

Private symbolisations are always \"constantly conjoined\" and represent most of the language used by the unconscious—although not all—in order to communicate. There is a crucial difference between conscious and unconscious forms of symbolism. From a different vertex, symbolism also represents a defence against narcissistic fusion. Narcissism represents a fusion between self and the external object; when related to space it will induce projective and introjective identifications and when related to time it will induce the presence of transference.",

      "abstract": "The expression of surprise—at something unexpected—is a key form of emotional display. Focusing on displays of surprise performed by means of reaction tokens (akin to Goffman's “response cries”), such as wow, gosh, oh my god, ooh!, phew, we use an ethnomethodological, conversation-analytic approach to analyze surprise in talk-in-interaction. Our key contribution is to detach the psychology of surprise from its social expression by showing how co-conversationalists collaborate to bring off an interactionally achieved performance of surprise. Far from being a visceral eruption of emotion, the production of a surprise token is often prepared for several turns in advance. We also show how surprise can be recycled on an occasion subsequent to its initial production, and how surprise displays may be delayed by silence, ritualized disbelief, and other repair initiations. Finally, we consider some of the uses of surprise as an interactional resource, including its role in the reflection and reproduction of culture.",

      "abstract": "The subject of this paper is courtship as a pattern of mainly nonverbal behavior a person exibits in order to win the interest, favor, trust, and love of the person who they want as a partner, by using their attractive looks, body posture, gestures, facial expression, and eye contact. The aim of the exchange of love signals in courtship is to attract and keep a desirable, suitable partner, which is of vital importance for an individual and for the human species. Over the last several decades, anthropologists, psychologists, and ethnologists (Givens, Buss, Moor, Morris, Perper etc.) have meticulously studied the complex process of human courtship. D. Givens (2014) differentiates between five connected phases of courtship: attracting attention - recognition phase - conversation phase - touching phase - making love. Each one of them has its main type of nonverbal communication, its specific goal, and a role in the total course of courtship. Only when a lower phase is successfully completed, can a person move on to the next, a more intimate one. However, if any of the two persons at any stage of courtship clearly refuses to continue 'the courting game ', the process is discontinued.",

      "abstract": "In the process of evolutionary development of animal psyche flickers of consciousness in forms of surmise appear. At a certain stage of evolution of humans these surmises are fixed in language, which causes formation of nets of nerve connections, which do not coincide with nets of non-speech psychological reflections. In the process of its development language turns into system of signs and begins to develop according to its own laws, which are supposedly connected to laws of development of consciousness. Along with language, the next generation transmits the experience not only of surmise but a system of flickers of conscience. In the process of learning a native language a child has singular flickers of consciousness accumulated by humanity, which join in constant streams of consciousness. Regulation of consciousness is realized by means of psychological and speech reflex replications, each of those separately may be available to consciousness only as singular flickers, but combined they can deliberately regulate streams of psychological reflections according to demands of actively purposeful actions, provide a possibility to understand being. Mechanism of regulation is retention of one of the streams (psychological or speech reflex) in the sphere of consciousness due to variability of the other, in the context of establishing identity of stable and variable. Key words: guess, image, perven’, psyche, reflex, consciousness . Accepted : 02.06.2017 Reviewed : 02.20.2017 Published : 03.24.2017 * * * * * Download/read PDF",

      "abstract": "The feeling of being present as observer and performer in some environment is hardly ever absent except in cases of pathology. The difficulty in achieving telepresence (or virtual reality) consists in making the observer feel his/her presence in the ‘‘remote’’ environment accessed by means of machine interfaces and not in the local and immediate surround. One feels present in a perceived environment when one can anticipate actions that access it. Sensory stimulation evokes these anticipations via an internal model that includes representations of both the observer’s body and its parts, objects in the environment, and the consequences of movements of the observer. Utilization of this model by performing actions to verify the anticipated consequences either confirms or disconfirms them. To the extent that the sensory consequences are not anticipated by the model, the sense of presence will suffer. But transmission through this motor-sensory loop informs the model about transforms in space and/or time that may be interposed and in some cases at least adaptation may allow the re-establishment of the feeling of presence.",

Animal communication is not the only source of at least suggestive evidence that animals engage in some sort of thinking. On the basis of this sort of common observation of pets and other domestic animals, those concerned with language and thinking have tended to conclude that animal communication always relates to very pressing and immediate situations and stimuli. The communication conveys information about things that are remote in both time and space from the sensory stimuli reaching the communicating animals at the time the communication takes place. Virtually all ethological evidence concerning the information conveyed by animal communication signals is necessarily limited to observing their effects on other animals.",

We are born at all because our parents are moved by desires for intimate relations. We are cared for because they are endowed with the drive to nurture us and with tendencies to bond to each other to facilitate such nurturance. We learn to think – to converse with ourselves mentally, using words – only by interacting with one another, using languages that are the products of millennia of such interactions. Our senses of self emerge in our early encounters with others, and we construct identities by comparing ourselves with others and apprehending our places in a social order.

      "title": "Measurement of Emotions in Different Groups",
      "abstract": "One of the prerequisites for the continuation of a society is that people can communicate with each other in an adequate way. This is mainly done by using the written or spoken word. By means of words we pass on thoughts, ideas, reactions and feelings. What interests us here is what may be called verbal communication. In everyday verbal communication people often presuppose that every word used by them has the same meaning to those they address as to themselves. As a rule this presupposition is probably unconscious, but it may also be conscious. The way we see it this presupposition is often erroneous. Two individuals may mean entirely different things by the same word. We will not discuss the meaning of meaning here; the common-sense meaning of meaning is enough for us. But we want to make a distinction between the two kinds of meaning a word, a verbal symbol, may have. It makes sense to talk of the descriptive meaning of a word and the emotive meaning of a word. One word may have the same descriptive meaning to two individuals but at the same time a different emotive meaning just as it may have a different descriptive meaning but the same emotive meaning. We will here chiefly discuss the emotive meaning. Our basic assumption is that if a word has a different emotive or descriptive meaning to two individuals, the two individuals do not belong to the same group or they used to belong to different groups. We then say that these two individuals do not live in the same symbol environment, i.e. the word is not attached to the same object for the two individuals. It is not associated with similar behaviotir and it is not associated with similar feeling. From this it follows that the situation or situations in which a word has been learned are of prime importance for the individual's linguistic usage. These ideas are mainly taken from Torgny T. Segerstedt.1) It is not absolutely necessary that a word with emotive meaning is consciously associated with a certain object, behaviour or readiness for action. That is to say, its emotive meaning need not be dependent, it may be independent; the word is solely emotional. The chief task of the word, from a sociological point of view, is to create a feeling to strengthen or keep the cohesion within the group.",

Some accounts of friendship can include (other than human) animals more easily than others. I present an argument in favour of characterising some animal-human connections as friendships, and address some of the standard objections to this characterisation. It might seem that under any conception of friendship, characterising animals as (potential) friends would likely lead to better treatment of animals, as various kinds of ill-treatment or use would not be consistent with treating someone as a friend. However, concern for animal welfare typically extends well beyond the direct concern for our own household companions, and is a concern for animals (or certain animals) in general, whereas friendship, by its nature, is particularist. There are limits to applying the concept of friendship to animal treatment beyond particular relationships.",

      "title": "Unconscious Processes",
      "abstract": "Consciousness has to do with two aspects of mental life: monitoring ourselves, our phenomenal awareness of our experiences, thoughts, and actions; and controlling ourselves, engaging in voluntary behavior that goes beyond reflex, instinct, and conditioned response. The unconscious mind—whether it exists at all, and if so what its scope and limits are—has been an important theoretical issue since the beginning of scientific psychology. There are of course many physical and biological processes that, in some sense, proceed unconsciously: the orbiting of planets around the sun and photosynthesis are two examples. Changes in blood pressure are not accessible to phenomenal awareness; and the brain activity which gives rise to consciousness itself goes on unconsciously (neurosurgeons assure us that there is no afference in the brain). But there is little point in talking about something being unconscious if that same thing cannot also be conscious, in the sense of being accessible to phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Therefore, the adjective unconscious only makes sense when applied to mental states and mental activity, as an adjectival contrast to conscious. Mental states come in various forms—namely cognition (percepts, memories, thoughts, and knowledge acquired through learning), emotion (positive and negative feelings), and motivation (desires and goals of approach and avoidance). Usually, these mental states are accessible to consciousness, in that people are generally aware of what they are thinking, what they want and feel. “The unconscious” is shorthand for mental states and processes that are inaccessible to introspective phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. The question is whether, and to what extent, mental states can exist (and mental activities transpire) outside the scope of phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Objection: If these mental states and activities are unconscious, how are we to know them? Answer: We know them indirectly by virtue of their effects on our ongoing conscious experience, thought, and action. Question: If there are two kinds of mental states and processes, conscious and unconscious, how do they compare and contrast? Answer: In principle, unconscious processes differ from conscious processes because they operate outside phenomenal awareness. And because conscious awareness is the logical prerequisite for conscious control; unconscious processes are not susceptible to voluntary self-regulation. Other differences between conscious and unconscious processes are empirical questions. This revision adds items that appeared through 2022.",

Through psychoanalysis it is possible to observe widely the subject as a whole, not focusing on the presence of organic or genetic disorders, Ansermet (2003) addresses this problem by stating that “We cannot see the subject only as someone who manifests an organic or mental defect, according to the logic of disability”. The systems that compose and organize the environment, according to Bronfenbrenner (1996), are constituted by the fitting of concentric structures called microsystem, what presents itself as the most active and direct contact environments, such as family, school or social work relationships; mesosystem referring to two or more environments of active social participation; exosystem, understood as environments that influence events that take place in the immediate environment of social relationship; and macrosystem, which comprise, in addition to the behavior of individuals, the connections between other people, the nature of bonds and the direct or indirect influence on the developing individual in the contexts in which they live and act actively.\nThe use of psychoanalysis as a tool to decipher possible mental disorders has become essential, since it is intrinsically linked to the biological look for the diagnosis of a patient. Autism, attention deficit disorder, depression and hyperactivity (ADHD), among other diseases that can be diagnosed during childhood or late they are psychosocial disorders that have their diagnoses complemented by psychoanalysis.\nIn this way, it is possible to perceive the challenges that psychoanalysis faces in terms of complementing the diagnosis of mental disorders in children, as well as the importance of psychosomatic studies in the elaboration of an accurate diagnosis that can be applied to children and their pathologists.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing the significance of the subject’s needs is not easy and one of the incidental body representations for the subject to self-recognize and be interpreted by others, is the ornamentation of the body or makeup (mask and disguise), as it would be a form Of emitting important messages to the others, in addition it can become personal mark. This decorated as a body-writing has different performances in communication, part of the sign complex and enunciative symbolic expression, ie a recreation of a space-time relationship with the universe, as they tell a story or reflect situational pictures, as if it were Of indelible memories. In addition they are subjective manifestations that have the close communion with emotion and it goes beyond the simple antropo-social-cultural conjugation. In fact, in instances related to the collective, the body becomes a semantized atmosphere, in an edifying cosmos of signs, codes, meanings and senses, which will intervene in a symbiosis with the world as context and articulated with the series of potentialities To construct meanings; Offers us infinite possibilities of interpretations opening a compass for the resignifications in the quotidian, for which we involve the ontosemiotic or semiotic of the affectivity-subjectivity like method, because in her the subject is a text that can be read and owns a Sensitive architecture. From this perspective a gap is opened whereby the ontosemiotic leaves the subject as a discourse.",

      "title": "A Duplex Model for Giftedness",
      "abstract": "This article proposes a duplex model for understanding giftedness. The first part of the duplex is the set of gifted skills and attitudes that one possesses as a result of heredity, the environment, and their interaction. It is the input that one has acquired from one’s life experiences. The second part of the duplex is the utilization or deployment of gifted skills and attitudes. On this view, giftedness, like intelligence, in practice heavily depends upon one’s attitudes toward deployment of abilities, not just the abilities themselves. It is the output that one gifts back to the world. Someone may possess giftedness in the first part of the duplex but give very little back in the second part. Alternatively, someone may make gifted contributions but not be identified as having the characteristics usually associated with giftedness. This can result because giftedness can be either trait-like or state-like. Some people act in gifted ways as a function of their interactions with tasks and situations, although they would not have been predicted to be individuals who would act that way. A full model should allow both for input and output—giftedness as a possession but also giftedness as it is deployed to make the world a better place.",

      "title": "Artists in Liberia and the United States: a Comparative View",
      "abstract": "In summary, six striking parallels have been found between the artist archetypes in Liberia and the United States, each of which appears to be rooted in some structural similarity between the two societies at the material and social levels. The structural factors which have been suggested as pivotal in determining the nature of the artist archetype have included: (1) the atypicality of the carver/artist/s labour process via-à-vis that of other workers; (2) the development of an alternate value profile congruent with that atypical process; (3) the need for itinerancy/migration to ensure a large enough market for self-support; (4) dependence on the élite class for patronage; (5) relative economic insecurity; and (6) a definition of the product which necessitates solitary labour. These factors combine to create in the general public the image of the artist described earlier. Some carvers and artists may appear to exhibit the traits imputed to them, and even ‘play into’ their expected image; but this phenomenon can be explained without invoking some innate ‘artistic temperament’ or transcultural ‘artist's rôle’. Rather, we can conclude that carvers and artists, like other human beings, are subject to specific material and social constraints that shape their own consciousness and that of their public. Though individuals make art, it is as true of art as of history, that ‘they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given, and transmitted from the past’.",

      "title": "STRESS-REACTIVITY AND STRESS-RESISTANCE AND MENTAL HEALTH OF PERSONALITY",
      "abstract": "Human health, as a biopsychosocial phenomenon, substantially depends on the responsiveness of an organism under certain conditions of activity and existence. Regarding a human being, the following types of responsiveness have been determined: biological or species-level responsiveness; group or constitutional responsiveness; individual physiological responsiveness; individual pathological responsiveness; specific responsiveness; non-specific responsiveness. Stress as the general adaptation syndrome and non-specific responsiveness of an organism significantly affects the physical and mental health of a personality by dint of the fight-or-flight or escape mechanisms. Concurrently, the scope of reaction related to the fight or escape is used to characterize stress responsiveness, which is genetically determined and is strictly individual. Thus, the behavioral mechanism of fight or escape preeminently refers to a constituent of unconditioned-reflex and instinctive activities of the human organism. Furthermore, phylogenetic constituents of the fight or escape mechanism are essentially supplemented by ontogenetic experience, becoming firmly established at the level of conditioned-reflex and instrumental activities. As a result, the main adaptation mechanism of stress responsiveness or mechanism of fight or escape can be viewed as a unique functional combination of inherited and acquired responses (unconditioned-reflex and conditioned-reflex reactions), which will considerably determine somatic and psychic norms as well as pathology of an organism. In its turn, stress responsiveness is tightly connected with the stress resistance of an organism. Indeed, stress resistance is an individual capability of an organism to maintain normal working efficiency under the influence of a certain stressor. Stress resistance can be enhanced with the help of learning; the essence of this learning lies in the conscious control of the activities of particular organs and systems and the behavioral activity of an organism as a whole. In psychology, stress resistance serves as the basis for successful social cooperation of a personality, which is predominantly characterized by emotional stability, as well as a low level of anxiety. Hence, stress resistance as a constituent of mental health in systemic relations with stress responsiveness contributes to the stability of homeostasis indicators with the involvement of morphological and functional reserves of an organism. In general, it is expedient to emphasize the following forms of stress responsiveness – low stress responsiveness (hypo stress responsiveness), adequate stress responsiveness (normal stress responsiveness), and increased stress responsiveness (hyper stress responsiveness). At the same time, there is a probable negative influence of both decreased and increased stress responsiveness on the constituents of mental health of a personality. In a holistic way, stress responsiveness and stress resistance of an organism significantly depend on the particularities of the central nervous system and autonomic nervous system, as well as the specifics of temperament in the corresponding systemic relations. In this respect, the two most important aspects of temperament, such as activity and emotionality (including anxiety) are distinguished. The diagnostics of stress resistance in the functional connection with stress responsiveness, along with morphological and functional reserves of an organism can include the following levels: 1) morphological level; 2) physiological level; 3) hematological level; 4) biochemical level; 5) immunological level; 6) level of the emotional sphere; 7) level of the cognitive sphere; 8) behavioral level. Psychophysiological particularities of active leisure and cognitive-behavioral therapy are aimed at the strengthening of stress resistance of an organism, as well as preservation of mental health of a personality under the corresponding conditions of activity and existence.",

Three groups of 12‐month‐old infants were tested for their willingness to encode a simple approach behavior as goal‐directed as a function of whether it was performed by (1) a human hand, (2) a morphologically unfamiliar green object that interacted with a confederate and behaved intentionally, or (3) the same unfamiliar green object that behaved in a matched, but apparently random manner. Using a visual habituation technique, only infants in the first two conditions were found to encode the approach behavior as goal‐directed. Thus infants appear able to attribute goals to non‐human, even unfamiliar agents. These results imply that by the end of the first year of life infants have a broad notion of what counts as an agent that cannot easily be reduced to humans, objects that are perceptually similar to humans, or objects that display self‐propulsion.",

In fact, the reason we communicate is to interact with others—to talk to another, to share our thoughts and insights with them, or to respond to their needs and requests. No matter how it is structured or conceptualized, communication is involved with addressing the other and dealing with the ontological, epistemological, and ethical questions of otherness or alterity.

Put educated chimpanzees together, though, and they turn out to have nothing to say to each other. We humans are different; we can even find silence awkward. Language does many things for us; conveying straight information is the most obvious. I want to stress, though, some of the ways that talk adjusts our terms for living together. What I say will be speculative and some of it will no doubt be wrong, but I suspect it is not completely off-base. Much of talk we can see as securing and adjusting terms of association – terms, among other things, of cooperation and mutual restraint. In part, this is a matter of governing our feelings toward each other. Feelings tend toward action; they can make for social glue or social bombshells. Nature, in the form of Darwinian evolution, has given us various ways to mesh feelings, and some of these. I think, are a matter of language.",

Given the vanishingly slight probability of all these conditions being met, why do we still act as though the debate about torture is little more than the debate about ticking bombs?",

This mobilization of the organism is followed by physiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses that damp down, minimize, and even erase the impact of that event. This pattern of mobilization-minimization appears to be greater for negative events than for neutral or positive events. Theoretical accounts of this response pattern are reviewed. It is concluded that no single theoretical mechanism can explain the mobilization-minimization pattern, but that a family of integrated process models, encompassing different classes of responses, may account for this pattern of parallel but disparately caused effects.",

      "abstract": "Potentially the image of one's self has visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile and kinesthetic components. Not all of these are equally accessible to conscious introspection. Not all are equally reproducible even by modern gadgets. But a faithful reproduction of the image of the self for experimental exploratory purposes would include all of these modalities in varying combinations and on all levels or systems, i.e., conscious, preconscious and unconscious. Of basic importance would be the systematic comparison of the effects on the one hand of verbal descriptions (whether in the subject's own words and voice, or in the words and voice of another) with the effects of the direct perception of his own image by one or more of these afferent modalities. Differences in their impact on the spontaneous stream of free associations would be the starting point for such an investigation, as is illustrated in this paper. Ultimately one would hope to use this as a tool with which to dissect the quality of human identifications. Repeated reproductions would be necessary for the exploration of the boundary between the \"I\" and the \"non-I\" worlds, for the study of the hypnotic process and of hypnotic phenomena in general and for the study of ego boundaries in sleep and in the transitions into and out of sleep. Such self-images have chronological dimensions as well as immediate ingredients. Basic investigations of these are only starting. A premature plunge into therapeutic applications, before we know much more about the nature of the experience itself, would seem to be extremely unwise.",

However, no research thus far has examined the effect of deceased animal imagery within nature documentaries on viewing intentions. The current research reveals that nature documentary scenes depicting different stages of an elephant’s decomposition influence the likelihood of watching, or discontinuing, said nature documentary. This effect is explained by three argument-related documentary elements: emotion, logic, and ethics. Additionally, viewers with lower levels of formal education, who may benefit from watching the nature documentary, experience more negative emotion when exposed to the deceased animal imagery, and perceive the imagery to be less ethical and logical. Overall, these results have important implications for nature documentarians who aim to influence attitudes and motivate behavior change through their message, because if individuals are not viewing the film, then the message is not being received.",

Beside measuring physiological variables an aid to assess the emotional states is the analysis of expressive behaviour of an individual respecting the relating context. Especially developed in mammals, which live in obligatory social i.e. in stable permanent social communities, are facial expression and gesture. Also horses display a differentiated expressive behaviour, which can be observed and analysed by humans. Moreover it could be demonstrated, that in situations of stress the display shown by horses (gesture, facial expression, posture) correlate with corresponding physiological reactions. Thus the expressive behaviour is suitable to assess the emotional states of horses depending on the situation.",

Norms develop that ground perception and action, providing standards for appraising conduct. The body finds itself motivated to enact itself as a character in the drama of life, carving from its beliefs, intentions, and experiences a unique identity and perspective. If a biological body can construct itself into a person by exploiting social mechanisms, could an electromechanical body, a robot, do the same? To qualify for personhood, a robot body must be able to construct its own identity, to assume different roles, and to discriminate in forming friendships. Though all these conditions could be considered benchmarks of personhood, the most compelling benchmark, for which the above mentioned are prerequisites, is the ability to sustain long-term relationships. Long-term relationships demand that a robot continually recreate itself as it scripts its own future. This benchmark may be contrasted with those of previous research, which tend to define personhood in terms that are trivial, subjective, or based on assumptions about moral universals. Although personhood should not in principle be limited to one species, the most humanlike of robots are best equipped for reciprocal relationships with human beings",

These hallucinations are not the outcome of a remembrance of an experience or an event and do not bring about any emotional relief or catharsis, but they supply valuable information. They resemble Jacques Lacan's description of the psychotic mechanism \"Forclusion.\" This mechanism relates to experiences that did not undergo the process of primary symbolization through language, and experiences where words were attached but were not bound to the language structure. The result being that these experiences did not enter into the unconscious discourse of the subject. This information can reappear as verbal hallucinations in the psychotic patient. In such cases, the therapist, with the assistance of the patient's family, must investigate the meaning of the verbal hallucinations through research into the patient's and family's history in the phase prior to language development. When such a connection is discovered, the therapist must then bridge the hallucinations with the events unknown to the patient but contained in his subconscious. The therapist's role in such cases resembles that of a parent with a child: To translate the subject's experience through language from the physical schema to the body image and symbolic plane and in so doing, give meaning to meaninglessness. In our paper three short clinical cases are presented.",

Through its private retelling, the presence within absence of a loved one (more commonly called soul, spirit, or phantom) assumes a narrative structure and its private and public retelling may be an early adaptive response after dying and death. The imaginal stories of emergence from and transcendence beyond death, separable from the reality-based recounting of dying and death, have been retold for thousands of years. Retelling this confluence of imaginal and reality-based stories privately or shared with family, close friends, and community members may recede in the early weeks and months, relegating the duration of the presence within absence to a chronologic past, but remaining implicit as a private, comforting interchange that can be summoned or come unbidden. For some grievers, the presence within absence may persist as a disabling fixation, necessitating an intervention guided by a shaman, clergy, or therapist who shares common elements in their healing practices.",

      "abstract": "The main thesis of this book is that pragmatics is emergent. That is to say, it is not a discrete entity but the product of many interacting variables. When we communicate with others, we draw on a range of capacities including (a) signalling systems such as language, gesture and facial expression, (b) cognitive systems such as theory of mind, inference and memory, (c) motor output systems such as the vocal tract and hand movement, and (d) sensory input systems such as hearing and vision. All of these ‘elements’ exist within the individual – i.e. they constitute an intrapersonal domain, but during communication they combine with those of other individuals to form an interpersonal domain. Interpersonal communication involves many choices – for example, which meanings are explicitly encoded, and which left implicit; which signalling system(s) are used; which meanings are most salient and relevant. The exercise of such choices requires multiple interactions between the various underlying semiotic, cognitive and sensorimotor capacities both within and between individuals. Intrapersonal and interpersonal domains are dynamic systems whose integrity and equilibrium are maintained via a continuous process of compensatory adaptation. The effect of this is most plainly seen when one or more individual elements malfunction and create an imbalance within the system as a whole.",

      "title": "Farm animal cognition",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although there may be task-specific differences in performance between wild and domestic animals, there is no evidence for any generally reduced cognitive capacity in domestic animals. It is not possible to compare intelligence between species or breeds without recognizing the contribution of differences in attention and motivation, and domestic animals often perform better on learning tasks than wild animals because they are less fearful. Considerable flexibility and complexity in behaviour can arise from context-specific decisions that may not require learning. Examples include alarm calling and maternal behaviour in chickens. However, the majority of intelligent behaviour shown by farm animals is dominated by learned associations, sometimes in response to remarkably subtle cues. Seemingly straightforward learning abilities may result in surprising emergent properties. An understanding of these properties may enable us to investigate how farm animals interact socially, and whether they form concepts. Other abilities, such as imitation and the re-organization of spatial information, do not appear to depend on associative learning. The study offarm animal cognition tells us little about the issue of animal consciousness but, none the less, plays an important role in the animal welfare debate. The types of cognitive abilities animals have provide clues as to the types of situations in which (given the benefit of the doubt) they might suffer.",

      "abstract": "The word \"ferment\" means commotion or excitement, as anyone who has witnessed a bottle of wild soda explode or a jar of kimchi overflow can attest to. In the acts of commotion in this chapter, an unreliable narrator guides the reader through multiple subjectivities. The narrator's credibility is compromised not due to a character flaw or psychological difficulties, but owing to a fundamental rejection of the individual. The narrator(s) weaves stories of host-parasite interactions, microbiome studies, and endosymbiotic evolutions to confuse categories of human/non-human. The last act proposes a twist on empathy: what becomes of this relation when agency is decentralized and distributed? While the general public tends to hail empathy as an unquestionable virtue, critical race theorists and other thinkers have illuminated the predatory tendencies of empathy, posed it as a failure of feeling – but a failure on whose part? Have we failed our feelings, or have they failed us? Or is failure inevitable within this mode of relationality built upon flawed metaphysics? As an educator, empathy is a concept that HSURAE hears only too often from students, because at the bottom of empathy is the question: how do we care for one another? We cannot dispense with it, but we need to find ways to delay, displace, and dub its meaning beyond the absolute individuation of subjectivity.",

The perfect expresses internal relations between processes and clauses (anteriority, backgrounding, causal relations); it refers to transitional processes that have reached or not their final instant, expressing changes of states and resulting states.

      "abstract": "Losing an intimate other to death belongs to the most uprooting experiences in human life. Not only is it accompanied by a range of negative emotions such as sorrow, longing, anger etc., but profound grief is a limit experience that causes a rupture in the sense of self of the bereaved. This experience is often expressed in identity statements such as ‘I no longer feel like myself’ or ‘I am missing part of myself’. Although such experiences are richly reported in empirical studies on grief and implemented in diagnostic criteria for pathological grief, their experiential meaning is largely left unexplored. In this article, I suggest that being bereaved of an intimate other is self-alienating because our sense of self is a distributed phenomenon relying on daily confirmation through interaction with our habitual environment. When our lives are intertwined with intimate others, this habitual identity become a dyadic structure, relying on a heteronomy. Being bereaved of this intimate other leads to a profound impoverishment of the habituated sense of self, leading to self-alienation. Finally, I discuss the process of returning to a non-alienating state and suggest that this is not exclusively a cognitive process, but equally an embodied process of appropriating a habitual identity.",

Trusting in a person means certitude in the critical knowledge one presumably possesses pertaining to that individual. Religious faith and dogmatic certitude are closely associated in general and may be based on various levels of emotional development and specific modes of relatedness. The transcendental quest of establishing identity with the nonmaterial and the spiritual realm of experience sees life span and physical existence as a preparatory phase for the purpose of launching the soul onto the everlasting spiritual life. Even the devoutly faithful spiritual leaders are subject to varieties of deviation, doubt, confusion, denial, ambivalence, or vacillation in their sense of certainty. The sense of conscious or unconscious mistrust can therefore function as a signal affect involved in compromise formation and conflict resolution.",

      "title": "[The ego--defense mechanisms and coping].",
      "abstract": "If the aims of defense and coping are considered, it can be concluded that essentially the different kinds of defense should serve to cope with reality. They intend either to inhibit the pressure of the unconscious drives and emotions or to bring them in tracks which are better to overlook. Or they tend unconsciously to reduce the demands of the surroundings and/or to make it possible to use former patterns of coping, as e.g. in regression and transference, or to reduce the cognitive and emotional reception of it, as in autism. Whereas those defense mechanisms, which preponderantly serve to deal with the drives and emotions, may lead to a better coping with the given situation, those defense mechanisms, however, which mostly serve to a reduction of the perception of the environment or to a decrease of expectations of the surroundings, are not increasing the coping capacities with a really given situation. But also when defense is rigid or excessive, which can, if a certain genetic predisposition is given, also be visible in autoimmune-processes, the coping with reality is more difficult. Thereby it is, however, to consider that a rigid defense diminishes the danger of ego-fragmentation and, especially when a psychotherapy is done, leads with the time on this way to a better coping with the outside reality and the inner possibilities. In serious terminal diseases a defense, which permits an active life, seems to have a better prognosis than a resignated acceptation of the illness, which originates in the activity of the superego. Heavy pain-syndromes in diseases which are not life-menacing can apparently be dealt with the better the more the concerned people succeed to turn the anxiety which is little related to objects in object-related fear. With that potencies of the ego are free which otherwise would have to be invested in the defense of anxieties.",

We propose and measure the concept of kama muta to understand experiences often given these and other labels. Do the same experiences evoke the same kama muta emotion across nations and languages? We conducted studies in 19 different countries, five continents, 15 languages, with a total of 3542 participants. We tested the construct while validating a comprehensive scale to measure the appraisals, valence, bodily sensations, motivation, and lexical labels posited to characterize kama muta. Our results are congruent with theory and previous findings showing that kama muta is a distinct positive social relational emotion that is evoked by experiencing or observing a sudden intensification of communal sharing. It is commonly accompanied by a warm feeling in the chest, moist eyes or tears, chills or piloerection, feeling choked up or having a lump in the throat, buoyancy and exhilaration. It motivates affective devotion and moral commitment to communal sharing. While we observed some variations across cultures, these five facets of kama muta are highly correlated in every sample, supporting the validity of the construct and the measure.",

      "abstract": "This article deals with systems at multiple levels, at least from cell to organization. It also deals with learning, decision making, and other behavior at multiple levels. Technological development of a human behavioral ecosystem appropriate to space environments requires an analytic and synthetic orientation, explicity experimental in nature, dictated by scientific and pragmatic considerations, and closely approximating procedures of established effectiveness in other areas of natural science. The conceptual basis of such an approach has its roots in environmentalism which has two main features: (1) knowledge comes from experience rather than from innate ideas, divine revelation, or other obscure sources; and (2) action is governed by consequences rather than by instinct, reason, will, beliefs, attitudes or even the currently fashionable cognitions. Without an experimentally derived data base founded upon such a functional analysis of human behavior, the overgenerality of “ecological systems” approaches render them incapable of ensuring the successful establishment of enduring space habitats. Without an experimentally derived functional account of individual behavioral variability, a natural science of behavior cannot exist. And without a natural science of behavior, the social sciences will necessarily remain in their current status as disciplines of less than optimal precision or utility. Such a functional analysis of human performance should provide an operational account of behavior change in a manner similar to the way in which Darwin's approach to natural selection accounted for the evolution of phylogenetic lines (i.e., in descriptive, nonteleological terms). Similarly, as Darwin's account has subsequently been shown to be consonant with information obtained at the cellular level, so too should behavior principles ultimately prove to be in accord with an account of ontogenetic adaptation at a biochemical level. It would thus seem obvious that the most productive conceptual and methodological approaches to long-term research investments focused upon human behavior in space environments will require multidisciplinary inputs from such wide-ranging fields as molecular biology, environmental physiology, behavioral biology, architecture, sociology, and political science, among others.",

But some objects are evidently media for the knowledge of “authorities” other than curators – such as ancestors, or even gods. Any question\r\nconcerning the voices of things (whether those of spirits or conservators, advertisers or masqueraders) depends, moreover, on a prior question – that of hearing; and also, within sound, that of touch. What conditions of listening to objects are engaged by their exhibition in museums – before they are ventriloquised by the contemporary mediation of apps and QR codes (never mind old-school audioguides)? The claim for “augmented realities” (whether virtual or participative) is not defined by such new media, however, but is already evidenced by the old media preserved in erstwhile ethnographic museums. The question of such objects’ voices is not limited to that of provenance, then, but may also be heard in the cadence of lament and prayer – expressed in the prosopopoeia of African masks, for example, by poets such as Okri, Osundare, and Senghor.",

      "abstract": "A widespread ritual institution in Central and Southern Africa is often referred to, or carries the name, of ngoma, at once the term for drum, as well as drumming or other musical instrumentation, singing, dancing, and the complex of constituent behavior and concepts. Particular manifestations of the institution often carry names denoting a regional or local variant that emerged at a certain time and spread into neighboring regions. Across the region where ngoma type rituals are located-much of Central and Southern Africa, and certain areas of Equatorial Africa-common characteristics include recruitment of those afflicted by a disease, chronic handicap, or social pathology; an initiation-like therapeutic course of several months or years leading from novice to fully-qualified healer status; a redefinition of the self or social group that has been defined as sick, and subsequently stabilized; an etiology of spirit possession that may occasionally be reflected in overt trance, but is often merely hypothesized and dealt with analytically; the tendency to think of the process of going through affliction and healing as a kind of legitimation for other leadership positions in society. This set of features, occasionally in association with the notion ngoma, has usually been studied and presented by scholars as a local, or tribally-particular phenomenon. This view distorts and trivializes the institution. The present paper is a distillation of a decade-long study of ngoma that has been historical and comparative in scope.

Charisma and play are contrasted with the routine and reject it. Separateness and segregation are inherent in charisma and play; yet both become routinized, stylized, institutionalized. The elaborate and complex nature of these concepts is illustrated by exam ining a study of wilderness-camping in which qualities of experience are expressed that can be derived from the ele ments of charisma and play. These qualities are more readily experienced by persons who are trained to experience them; most leisure-activities are not felt to be so moving or touching, and outdoor recreation as well as the rest of the activities which occupy us during our free time are not usually endowed with transcendent qualities.",

This is not to say that sanctions are never required, for example, to deter crime; but, as H. L. A. Hart said, they are not “the normal motive for obedience” to the law, and I have argued that they cannot be the only motive sustaining cooperation.",

      "abstract": "There is no disputing that modern man suffers bodily harm from inevitable frictions with his environment; the mediating powers of his mental apparatus are not always able to bring the two properly into line with each other. In the case of social stress, and/or if the person suffers from a permanent deficit (physical, sensory, or mental), ruptures in harmony can end only in pathology and affect the person's mental health. To escape from this predicament, and to prevent this pathology, we now have therapeutic means termed rehabilitation to back up classic drug therapy and psychotherapy. We should mention especially that without these psychosocial care procedures, which are sometimes long term, deinstitutionalization of the disabled, which is the dominant trend at present, has every chance of failing and turning into drifting and/or social disengagement because of exhausting and destructive family situations. Indeed, despite progress in biogenetics and certain other methods, the future does not lie in elimination of physical and mental handicaps: we would still have to be able to intervene in the environment and the immediate surroundings, which are the natural triggering and suppressing mechanisms of biological stress and molecular effectors.",

This account holds that an emotion is sentimental where it is excessive, misjudges its object and involves savouring a positive self-image. This paper presents two different challenges to the received view. First, the positive idealizations of sentimentality are no worse than other cognitive biases pervasive in our ordinary mental life. Moreover, where, as is often the case, sentimentality is good for our well-being, sentimentality looks broadly rational. Second, and more radically, sentimentality is not always to be evaluated in epistemic terms. Rather, sentimentality, often at least, is a matter of reminding us of or re-orientating our non-cognitive affective attachments. Sentimental works can renew or revolutionize our affective attachments for the good, whether that be towards love, family, causes, or the oppressed. Hence, in both art and life, sentimentality is sometimes a very good thing.",

At a sensory level, the means by which the world comes to be organized into objects is a far from trivial problem, since stimulus information is typically ambiguous as to which local parts of a scene ‘belong’ together. It is also unclear how different forms of sensory information combineödoes each sense operate independently, or is information integrated in forms of multi-modal representation (Driver, this issue)? Furthermore, the behavioural responses we are equipped to make are inherently limited.We may only name one object at a time; we can reach at most to two objects. The information available to our senses needs to be selected, so that only elevant parts of the world are represented for action. In this way, action may interact in important ways with perceptual processing. Scenes may be parsed in different ways according to our intended behaviour. Perception and action may be linked through processes of selective attention (Milner, this issue; Tipper et al., this issue).",

      "abstract": "Affective science is stuck in a version of the nature-versus-nurture debate, with theorists arguing whether emotions are evolved adaptations or psychological constructions. We do not see these as mutually exclusive options. Many adaptive behaviors that humans have evolved to be good at, such as walking, emerge during development–not according to a genetically dictated program, but through interactions between the affordances of the body, brain, and environment. We suggest emotions are the same. As developing humans acquire increasingly complex goals and learn optimal strategies for pursuing those goals, they are inevitably pulled to particular brain-body-behavior states that maximize outcomes and self-reinforce via positive feedback loops. We call these recurring, self-organized states emotions. Emotions display many of the hallmark features of self-organized attractor states, such as hysteresis (prior events influence the current state), degeneracy (many configurations of the underlying variables can produce the same global state), and stability. Because most bodily, neural, and environmental affordances are shared by all humans–we all have cardiovascular systems, cerebral cortices, and caregivers who raised us–similar emotion states emerge in all of us. This perspective helps reconcile ideas that, at first glance, seem contradictory, such as emotion universality and neural degeneracy.",

      "abstract": "The invitation in this chapter is to see or remember1 what can be gained and achieved by turning our attention from a style of thinking and speaking that focuses on the “truth about things” and shifting it to a recognition of the contribution of our own cultural practices in how things come-to-be what they seem. We are invited to look at human social processes and the relationships of how things in the world get caught up in these, historical or current but always active, processes and in so doing create meaning.The point here is to arrest or interrupt the spontaneous, unself-conscious flow of our ongoing activity, and to give “prominence to distinctions which our ordinary forms of language easily make us overlook.” ( Wittgenstein, 2001, p. 43 )We are invited to indulge a little less in the apparent “nature of things” and instead give a little more attention to the practices that make things happen and the relations between their inter-actors. Rather than having the relationship between “a directly perceiving mind and reality” as our primary focus we are looking afresh at those social processes that attribute characteristics to its actors and “cause us to hold beliefs.” We might call this “relational practicing.”2 I assume that the proper study of interaction is not the individual and his [sic] psychology, but rather the syntactical relations among the acts of different persons mutually present to one another….. …Not, then, men [sic] and their moments. Rather moments and their men. ( Goffman, 1982, p. 2 )Goffman richly points out the variety of ordinary, everyday ways in which people participate in social encounters and how they conduct the minutia of constitutive relational practices. Goffman spent a lifetime illuminating the relevance of the almost hidden inter-participant grammar in cooperative performance of coordinated meaning and structure and also had much to say about the practical relationships between the actors and those prevailing enacted structures.",

These levels exist because of the different demands on searching for the essence. 1. The level of historical interpretation: It has an analogical connection with the material, physical approach. 2.The level of mythological interpretation: It has an analogical connection with the level of unconsciousness and partly collective unconsciousness. 3.The level of intellectual, mental interpretation: It has an analogical connection with human and archetypal contents of men.

      "abstract": "The expressions we see in the faces of others engage a number of different cognitive processes. Emotional expressions elicit rapid responses, which often imitate the emotion in the observed face. These effects can even occur for faces presented in such a way that the observer is not aware of them. We are also very good at explicitly recognizing and describing the emotion being expressed. A recent study, contrasting human and humanoid robot facial expressions, suggests that people can recognize the expressions made by the robot explicitly, but may not show the automatic, implicit response. The emotional expressions presented by faces are not simply reflexive, but also have a communicative component. For example, empathic expressions of pain are not simply a reflexive response to the sight of pain in another, since they are exaggerated when the empathizer knows he or she is being observed. It seems that we want people to know that we are empathic. Of especial importance among facial expressions are ostensive gestures such as the eyebrow flash, which indicate the intention to communicate. These gestures indicate, first, that the sender is to be trusted and, second, that any following signals are of importance to the receiver.",

      "title": "Moral Traces and Relational Autonomy",
      "abstract": "One feature of James Childress's approach to ethics is the experience of \"moral traces\" that agents ought to feel in situations of conflict after they have overridden one strong value for the sake of another.1 This experience grasps at something intuitive about the moral life, that in situations of intense moral conflict when we are faced with a choice to act in a way that goes against a deeply held value, it is morally important that we feel and respond a certain way. At the most immediate level, this might entail privately mourning or grieving that we had to violate the value. Doing so would affirm that we care about the overridden value, and by acknowledging such a care we would feel that our moral integrity has been protected. But shouldn't the concept of moral traces entail more than a private process of grief? Shouldn't it have an effect on our relations with others? Moral traces ought to obligate us to act toward others in certain ways, and in that sense it is a concept quite distinct from the pangs of conscience we feel when we have behaved badly. At the very least, these traces ought to press us to offer an explanation or justification to others for why we acted against an important moral value, especially if those others were affected negatively by our action. In more extreme cases, we might even be compelled to make amends or offer reparations to the one or ones who were harmed by our action.2In this article I am interested in sorting through the ways that moral traces function in the moral life, especially in terms of the work they do in maintaining and building social and institutional relationships. I want to suggest that moral traces are more than an internal attitude that pertains to individual flourishing; they are also integral to communal well-being. By pointing to a contrast between moral traces as important for individual flourishing and moral traces as conducive to increased communal well-being, I also hope to expand our thinking about the liberal principle of autonomy that is central to Childress's approach. I am motivated in this article by a worry that some might use the appeal to moral traces to reinforce an individualistic, psychological notion of the self. This is clearly something that Childress does not do, as can be seen in his 1970 Soundings article, \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?\" There he tethers the equitable distribution of scarce medical resources firmly to the maintenance of relationships of trust. In later writings, he explicitly outlines the obligations to others that emerge in situations when an important value has been overridden. Relationships of trust and the obligations to others incurred by moral traces both point to a conception of agency that is relational.In what follows, I hope to suggest the broad contours of an account of moral traces that highlights its relational features. Looking at moral traces through a relational lens accentuates, and perhaps even intensifies, the obligations that they incur. Put differently, relational conceptions of autonomy require a more careful account of moral traces—one that focuses on what we owe one another. By a relational conception of autonomy, I mean a view of agency that sees the choices we make as shaped by our relations with and commitment to others. Highlighting moral traces as central to the moral life is a way to recognize the importance of human accountability, which ensures that we are always fully aware of how our actions affect others. Ultimately, the significance of the effect of moral traces does not lie simply in protecting an agent's integrity or sense of herself as morally whole but rather in how it promotes the building and maintaining of relations.Annette Baier makes this point eloquently in her critique of Michael Stocker's account of moral guilt—a concept that, while not exactly synonymous with moral traces, does share a family resemblance. She notes that although Stocker is concerned about the effects of moral dilemmas, his \"attention is given to the emotions of choosers, not to the feelings of the victims or beneficiaries of their choices\" (1992, 363). At another point, Baier refers to the \"dirty hands\" metaphor as pushing us \"into a Lady Macbeth frame of mind, obsessed with our own stained character rather than what we have done to others and how that felt for them\" (363).3 It is precisely this sense of how those harmed by our actions might feel that makes moral traces such a central component of a relational account of morality. Baier writes, \"Without a moral psychology that puts informed empathy and willingness to listen to others' point of view squarely in the center of our moral-psychological capacities, without a social interactive account both of rationality and of morality, the constraints that moral psychology can put on what counts as 'a more acceptable version of ethics' will be merely formal and very limited\" (365).While Childress does not use the term moral traces in his early Soundings article, he does offer some brief thoughts that hint at its further development in later writings. His short mention of moral guilt in this article serves as an impetus for my reflections about how moral traces can serve a relationship-building or maintaining purpose. I begin by assessing what he says in the Soundings article, especially as it relates to the view of the theologian Helmut Thielicke, whom Childress discusses in this article. I then look to Childress's discussion of moral traces in later writings on war, bioethics, and public health. Finally, as a way to further examine the relational implications of the concept, I turn to two fairly recent concepts in the bioethics literature: moral distress in nursing ethics and \"the patient as victim and vector model\" in public health ethics. While certainly not identical to Childress's conception of moral traces, these concepts reinforce a similar sentiment about relationality and our obligations to others in difficult moral cases. They also help us see that moral traces are not only located in the individual conscience or in the moral universe more generally; their effects are also embodied in institutional procedures.4 This echoes Childress's sentiment in the 1970 Soundings article that one of the tasks of social ethics is \"to propose relatively just institutional arrangements within which self-interested and biased men can live\" (Childress 1970, 342).In the 1970 article \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?,\" James Childress makes a passing reference to a concept that forms a connective tissue through the corpus of his work in areas as diverse as conscience, war, and bioethics. He suggests that the allocation of scarce lifesaving medical resources (SLMR) presents us with \"'borderline situations' which inevitably involve guilt\" (1970, 175). He borrows the phrase \"borderline situations\" from the German theologian Helmut Thielicke, who had only recently addressed the issue of allocation of scarce lifesaving resources at a symposium held in Texas. It is not fully clear in his brief discussion of Thielicke whether or not Childress believes that decisions about allocating scarce medical resources must involve guilt.5 He writes, \"Even if all actions in SLMR should involve guilt, some may preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others\" (347). What is clear, however, is that he distances himself from Thielicke's view that the best humans can do in the face of these borderline situations is \"to understand and endure—not 'solve'\" them. By contrast, Childress believes that one can make discriminating judgments using the tools of ethics so that even our choices about \"who shall live when not all can live\" are informed by the notion that some decisions may \"preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others.\" For him the preservation of human dignity is achieved through a careful evaluation of the factors and norms in a given situation. Thus, whereas for Thielicke, any ethical judgment in such situations is flawed, Childress holds more optimistically that reasoned ethical judgments are possible. For both of them, however, the agent's realization that she is affected in some way by such difficult moral choices is important to her human flourishing. What is unclear in this brief reference is the nature and extent of this effect on the moral agent. Does it morally obligate her to make some sort of amends, or does it simply do its work on a psychological level in terms of ensuring that the overridden principle does not lose its potency?Thielicke's ideas about moral guilt are both deeply existential and deeply theological. For Thielicke, the guilt that results from moral dilemmas is debilitating to the point that it leaves the Christian moral agent with very few viable options. Indeed, he does not see the task of evangelical theological ethics as providing easy answers or solutions to ethical problems.6 Roman Catholic casuistry and its legalistic and naturalistic theology falls prey to this temptation. He uses the term \"borderline situations\" (Grenzsituation) to depict what he calls \"abnormal cases,\" ones that involve \"transitions or complications\" (Thielicke 1966, 578).7 The prime example of such a situation for Christians, according to Thielicke, is when they must use the methods of their evil opponent, as in the case of the duty to fight oppressive tyrannical dictatorships. Thus the individual Christian, especially if he holds political responsibility, is \"ineluctably forced into a situation in which he must act within a framework of injustice\" (585). What such situations teach Christians is that the world is fallen: \"man has perverted his world, and no man is exempt from sharing responsibility for this human character of his world, this demonic humanizing of the world. No man is merely the object of a conflict situation. We are all part of the human subject that helped to bring it about\" (597). Thus what is communal about this guilt for Thielicke is that the difficult moral conflict serves to remind Christians of their ongoing guilt as children of Adam. The borderline situation has its \"origin in a communal guilt which already stands behind our situation and which we for our part ever increase and intensify…. We are both channels and perpetrators of cosmic guilt\" (602).Borderline questions, according to Thielicke, \"preclude the possibility of any final answers.\" He writes, \"The questions must remain open\" (1970, 147). The impossibility of any final answers to difficult moral dilemmas is firmly grounded in certain theological presuppositions, such as human sinfulness. Thielicke understands the human condition of sin as a usurpation of man's limits—a going beyond the limits to which humans are destined. Put differently, it is that man \"has placed himself in sinful contradiction to the destiny for which he was created\" (154). In essence, human creativity—the ability to transform nature into culture—is always tainted by humanity's inability to accept its destiny as God's creatures. Humans are always pressing the boundaries of their creatureliness. He contrasts the Christian view that identifies suffering with human guilt and responsibility to secular ideas that attribute life's tragedy to the structures of the world. He writes, \"In myth … this world which is no longer whole tends to be regarded as something given, an intact structure in which guilt and fate are inseparably interwoven. The Bible, on the contrary, looks instead at man. It sees not the structure, but this personal representative of our disjointed world\" (156).Human sinfulness is not manifested in particular actions. Rather it is the very structure of human existence that is the root of human guilt. In essence, for Thielicke, there is no possible choice that a human can make in the face of any moral decision that would relieve her of this existential guilt: \"It is a matter of being, not action\" (164). Yet there are certain types of situations in which human decisions and human actions can bring about greater guilt. Indeed it is the experience of guilt that is a measure of the person's moral health and well-being. Like a wound that cannot be allowed to heal, the guilt one feels when making difficult moral decisions such as allocating scarce medical resources is difficult. In contrast to the utilitarian who is able to make a decision with clear-cut objective criteria, the moral person must suffer the anguish of the \"impossibility of the task.\" Her suffering is felt in \"pangs of conscience\" that are \"a kind of gauze placed in the wound to prevent its healing in the wrong way.\" Continuing with the metaphor, he insists that while the wound must not be closed, it must not be allowed to infect the moral actor: \"The pus of the insoluble dilemma must have some way of escaping. Otherwise, the very humanity of the physician himself becomes infected; he succumbs to the illusion of the easy solution\" (173). Only by keeping the wound open does Thielicke believe that humans can arrive at an awareness of the very essence of what it is to be human.The most obvious contrast between Thielicke and Childress in the Soundings article is that Childress's view of human guilt is not explicitly connected to theological and existential ideas about the ongoing guilt of humans before God. Thielicke's view of cosmic guilt undermines his confidence that any method of deciding how to allocate scarce lifesaving devices can ever really be justifiable. He invokes casting lots, but unlike Childress, his endorsement of it is lukewarm at best. He sees it as an unsatisfactory option but perhaps the best one humans have available to them in such a situation.There are two points from the Soundings article that are relevant to my attempt to rethink the concept of moral traces. First, while Childress's view about guilt in \"borderline situations\" is not explicitly developed in the article, his engagement with Thielicke is illuminating because I believe it foreshadows his later emphasis on moral traces. Thielicke's insistence that the \"wound\" should not infect the actor supports my contention that moral traces ought to do more than simply affect the individual; they must incur some sense of obligation to others. Second, Childress bases his strong support of random selection on the belief that it is the best option for maintaining human dignity, equality, and trust. All three of these values are, in his view, important for building and maintaining relationships. Childress is explicit about this in several places in the article. Quoting Paul Ramsey, he describes equality of opportunity \"as the ethical substance of the relations of those individuals to one another\"(Childress 1970, 348). In another passage, he describes trust as \"an attitude of expectation about another,\" namely, the expectation that one will be treated with respect (349).When we turn to Childress's 1978 article on just war in Theological Studies, we begin to see the full development of the concept of moral traces. In this more extended discussion, he situates them within \"the logic of prima-facie duties.\" Relying on the moral philosopher W. D. Ross, he argues that prima facie obligations are more binding than relative principles that function like rules of thumb, and less binding than absolute principles that can never be overridden. Thus, a prima facie obligation is \"intrinsically binding, but it does not necessarily determine one's actual obligation\" (1978, 430). A central component of the logic of these conflicting obligations is that \"an overridden or outweighed prima-facie obligation continues to function in the situation and the course of action one adopts\" (431; emphasis mine). Childress explicitly uses the phrases \"moral traces\" and \"residual effects\" in this article to describe how the outweighed obligation \"continues to function.\"He also turns to A. C. Ewing, who specifies more clearly how the overridden obligation continues to have a hold on the moral agent. For Ewing this hold results in a \"mental attitude\" that evokes regret, but even more important, that ought to affect the agent's future actions. Ewing writes, \"My omission to fulfill my prima facie duty to him in this case will increase the force of any prima facie obligations I may have to him as regards future actions. And even if it did not affect overt action, the existence of a prima facie obligation not to do it should always affect our mental attitude towards an action.\" Ewing describes the mental attitude as \"a positive thing even if not translated into action\" and writes further that \"a good man will at least regret the violation of prima facie duties\" (1959, 110). In a footnote, Childress comments that for W. D. Ross, the appropriate response to an overridden obligation is not shame or repentance but rather compunction.Childress's views about the intensity of this mental attitude after a moral conflict are not fully developed in this discussion. Yet he manages to introduce a broad array of terms to describe it: residual effects, regret, shame, repentance, compunction. He seems to favor the terms—traces and residue—that suggest a less intense effect on the moral agent. Elsewhere in the article, he claims more directly that guilt is not the appropriate emotional attitude in such cases. He supports, without fully developing, a notion of \"creative regret\" that he borrows from Albert R. Di Ianni (Childress 1978, 433). However, in discussing the jus ad bellum criterion of \"right intention\" as the maintenance of proper motives, he states \"an attitude of regret, if not remorse, is appropriate when a prima-facie obligation is overridden\" (438). Such a clear statement equating moral traces with regret is not typical of his discussions in later work, such as Principles of Bioethics (PBE).Nevertheless, in his view, overriding a principle does lead to specific obligations. These are most explicit in his discussion of the jus in bello criteria—the criteria that govern how to conduct war. His primary point is that even though a just war requires one to overrule the prima facie obligation not to injure or kill another, the hold that the obligation has on the moral agent is not \"overruled.\" In other words, the agent still must discharge some obligations to the other—and these obligations require that (1) the immediate object of war is not to kill or even injure, (2) one ought not directly target noncombatants, (3) one cannot impose \"unnecessary suffering,\" and (4) any effect (even if only indirect) of war on civilians \"must be justified by the principle of proportion\" (441). By connecting moral traces to the jus in bello criteria, Childress reinforces a notion that these traces are more than just an internal wound or disposition, and instead constitute an attitude that necessarily entails an obligation to minimize the harms caused by overriding a prima facie duty.When we turn our attention to Childress's later work, especially in PBE, we see that moral traces play a significant role in two ways: to remind the agent that prima facie duties are not neutral values and to highlight the centrality of conscience and integrity as virtues in the practice of medicine. The account of the logic of prima facie duties in PBE follows quite closely the account presented in the earlier just-war article. For example, Childress and his coauthor, Tom Beauchamp, argue that when overriding a prima facie obligation, there will always be traces of \"regret and a sense of moral residue.\" They write, \"Moral residue results because an overridden prima facie obligation does not simply go away when overridden\" (Beauchamp and Childress 2009, 19). While overlapping in some ways with their discussion of conscience, the two concepts remain distinct. Childress describes conscience as \"an internal sanction that comes into play through critical reflection.\" While this sanction may have different forms, he notes that it \"often appears as a bad conscience—in the form of feelings of remorse, guilt, shame, disunity, or disharmony—as the individual recognizes his or her acts as wrong\" (44). The sanction of a bad conscience is different from the feeling of moral traces, because with the former, the agent feels that the act she performed is wrong. Moral traces, by contrast, imply that one has \"residual obligations\" or that one needs to at least acknowledge internally that an important obligation or value has been sacrificed, but not that the act itself is wrong. Nevertheless, moral traces share with the conscience the ability to help repair any disunity or disharmony that the agent may have experienced in the context of the difficult dilemma.One final example of the role of moral traces in Childress's work comes from his writings on the moral foundations of public health. Along with several colleagues, he has suggested that public health officials must satisfy five justificatory conditions when choosing to override individual liberty or justice. These are effectiveness, proportionality, necessity, least infringement, and public justification. It is the last of these that I think illustrates most clearly the connection between moral traces and obligations. In particular, the public health setting provides an example of institutional obligations that result from acknowledging that an important value has been overridden. The responsibility that public officials have in this regard is \"to explain and justify that infringement, whenever possible, to the relevant parties, including those affected by the infringement.\" They must offer moral reasons because they are required to \"treat citizens as equals\" (Childress et al. 2002, 173). This activity of accountability to the public is, in Childress's words, \"indispensable for engendering and sustaining public trust, as well as for expressing justice.\" It involves actively seeking ways to engage the public with the decisions being made on its behalf. This engagement involves seeking out the public's input, maintaining transparency about the process, and providing relevant information to the public. Although Childress and his coauthors do not use the language of moral traces in this discussion of public justification, their appeal to the obligations that public authorities have when they have infringed upon or overridden important moral values is a by-product of the traces. Childress's emphasis on ongoing obligations illustrates his belief that difficult moral decisions do not come to an abrupt end; they do not disappear. Rather, responsible moral agents ought to continue to act and feel in ways that acknowledge the ongoing implications of these decisions.What can we conclude about Childress's view of moral traces from this quick summary of his work? First, it seems clear that he does not see moral traces as identical to moral regret. Individuals can experience moral traces while being sure that they made the right decision in difficult moral situation. In other words, they are not wishing that they had done something else.8 Rather, they are taking the implications of what they did seriously. Second, his view of moral traces as incurring ongoing obligations supports an account of agency that is relational. This conclusion runs counter to prevailing critiques of Childress's \"principlism\" that depict it as grounded in a conception of the agent as an isolated, atomistic individual.Accounts of personhood as relational have become fairly commonplace in normative ethical discussions, especially ones that are informed by feminist, virtue, narrative, or communitarian visions. The \"relational self\" is usually posited over against the individualistic moral agent believed to be prevalent in certain liberal philosophical approaches. This individualistic vision of autonomy is also commonly associated with bioethics discourse, especially with Childress's approach.9 Critics of autonomy worry about the tendency to see the self as independent and separate from the discursive contexts that shape our commitments and values. They think a more accurate description of moral agency is one of responsiveness to the particularities of situations and to the network of dependencies that enable individuals to flourish. While the emphasis on particularity and dependency has been appealing to many feminist theorists, some have rejected a wholesale abandonment of autonomy as potentially antithetical to feminist political goals. They are skeptical of views that mistakenly stereotype individual autonomy as fundamentally individualistic and rationalistic. Thus they want to salvage autonomy because of the central role they believe it plays in feminist analyses of oppression, subjection, and agency. The model of relational autonomy has emerged as a useful hybrid that takes the concerns raised by critics of autonomy seriously without abandoning the important function of respect for the dignity of the individual.10The principle of autonomy is clearly central to Childress's ethics. Even in the Soundings article, we can see that he supports random selection for the allocation of scarce medical resources because it preserves respect for dignity and autonomy. Yet it is important to note that for Childress this respect for autonomy does not preclude attention to relationships. Indeed, it is intimately tied to the attitudes of trust necessary for society to function. Trust provides us with one example of a deeply relational concept that is intimately tied to respect for autonomy, insofar as it reflects our ultimate respect for the other's dignity and humanity. Childress's emphasis on moral traces and the obligations they produce also supports a concept of autonomy that is attentive to human relationships. While Childress avoids pressing moral traces and regret into the stronger realms of remorse or guilt, his emphasis on residual obligations in the contexts of war, bioethics, and public health suggests that the effects of moral traces extend beyond individual conscience. They require the moral agent to attend to the impact of her act on human relationships, both private and public. This suggests that for Childress, no moral decision exists in an isolated vacuum. We cannot thus speak of individual autonomy apart from the broader social contexts that all humans inhabit. As Courtney Campbell reminds us, certain elements of Childress's theology—namely, his claims about humans created in God's image—provide the basis for a view of autonomy that goes against certain secular notions of autonomy that privilege individualism and self-determination. Childress's theologically informed view of autonomy, according to Campbell, \"must be qualified by considerations of dependence, sociality, and finitude\" (Campbell 1989).Moral traces result when one voluntarily makes a choice to act in a certain way, but recognizes that in one's doing so, an important moral principle or value is threatened or even sacrificed. But what about cases in which the choice to act is not completely voluntary, when the agent is constrained by institutional pressures? These cases are captured by the terms moral distress and moral residue—terms that have come to be associated primarily with nursing ethics. The discussion of these terms is not always very precise in the literature, where we often see the terms conflated. It is useful, however, to get a sense of how these concepts work and to ask whether they offer any useful insights for thinking about the relational component of moral traces.The appeal to the language of moral distress and moral residue in nursing ethics refers to a much more intense sentiment than Childress's appeal to moral traces. Indeed, at times it sounds like a radically different phenomenon—something that results from forced violations of moral values, rather than from genuinely dilemmatic situations. In that sense, it is more like situations that involve violations of conscience and integrity. Recall that in PBE, Beauchamp and Childress distinguish moral traces from conscience. Nevertheless, discussions of moral distress can show us how internal reflections about our moral choices can and should have an effect on our obligations to others. More particularly, they draw attention to the implications of moral traces on institutional structures and procedures.Jameton's pioneering article on the issue of moral distress in nursing makes an important distinction between moral dilemmas (which Childress believes gives rise to moral traces) and moral distress. Moral dilemmas occur when \"it is clear to the nurse that different and important values conflict, but no choice presents itself that preserves both\" (Jameton 1993, 542). In contrast, distress is what occurs when a moral agent is unable to act on a judgment as a result of institutional or professional constraints. For Jameton, moral dilemmas present interesting material for students of philosophy to ponder, but in reality, they are rare and, in his words, \"are bad news and to be avoided\" (543). By dismissing moral dilemmas as rare occurrences, Jameton pays little attention to the experiences of moral regret or guilt. He worries, however, that nurses often conflate or confuse dilemmas (in the philosophical sense) with the experience of moral distress. In other words, when asked to describe their experiences, nurses often characterize the distress they feel at not being able to act on their judgments as dilemmatic. Although he acknowledges that distress can and often does give rise to \"second-order\" moral dilemmas, it is a mistake to view situations when one's choices are constrained institutionally as dilemmatic. To do so leads nurses to unnecessarily blame themselves for situations over which they have little control. I think Jameton's point is pertinent because I take him to be saying that when nurses view their actions as resulting from genuine dilemmas instead of from unjust institutional structures, they will experience the wrong kind of guilt. What really matters for nurses is that institutions treat them justly by allowing them opportunities to participate fully in the decision-making process. Jameton is worried about the conflation of dilemmatic situations and situations of moral distress because of its implications for moral responsibility. The importance of the category of \"moral distress\" is that it draws attention to how nurses are often forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held beliefs and commitments. This violation leads to a significant moral crisis that can potentially paralyze the agent. In other words, unlike moral traces, moral distress does little for relationship and community building. Indeed, it leads to disintegration. The \"distressed\" nurse is isolated and finds herself alienated from her institutional and professional role. In the end, while the literature on moral distress often seems to be referring to something different from moral traces in the sense that Childress uses the term, it can offer us some useful insight about relationship/community building in the aftermath of difficult moral problems. In particular, it helps us to think about how moral traces in Childress's sense ought to lead to just social and institutional arrangements.Margaret Battin's recent contribution to public health ethics offers us more resources for thinking about moral traces and their relational features. She intends her work as an intervention in bioethics and public health ethics—one that attempts to undermine the notion of the self that underlies these approaches. Her approach is animated by several concerns. One has to do with a failure of bioethics to account for infectious disease as a defining feature of human experience. For Battin, this seemingly minor oversight overlooks something very important about our nature as human animals. She writes, \"Infectiousness is an especially direct reminder of how misleading the paradigms of individualism can be\" (Battin et al. 2009, 78). Battin's overarching goal, however, is to develop a more sensitive account of public health ethics. While she does not explicitly address the ideas of regret, remorse, or conscience, I believe her reminder about our biological reality as deeply interconnected creatures serves as a useful impetus for thinking about the implications of relational autonomy.Battin describes the self as a \"way-station,\" and \"embedded\" self, a vision of subjectivity that resonates with many feminist critiques of autonomy.11 Battin's important insight is that to speak of persons as shaped and constituted by and through their webs of relations is to speak about something physical and biological. She visualizes, rather than a romantic vision of relationality as constituted merely by friendship and familial relations, the individual as a \"launching pad and breeding ground for trillions of organisms that move from one human being to another, either directly or by way of intermediate vectors\" (462). This biological view expands the feminist account of relational autonomy. She writes, \"Attention to social locatedness is not enough. Physical locatedness … is critical as well\" (78).While clinical medicine has tended to see the patient primarily as a victim, public health has seen the patient primarily as a vector. Battin urges public health and bioethics to view patients as both simultaneously, \"an account in which the patient can be seen as both victim and vector at the same time, a person simultaneously occupying both morally relevant roles\" (87). Another way to put this is that we need to think of ourselves not only in terms of the threats to us but also in terms of the threats we potentially pose to others. This, according to Battin, draws a more nuanced and complex picture of moral agency. In particular it complicates notions of responsibility and blame that posit that we can always know who is to blame and for what. The biological view of ourselves as victims and vectors of infectious disease acknowledges that we cannot always know with certainty who is to blame (who harms and who is harmed).This view of the self provides an interesting grounding to the notion of moral traces as a relational concept. Agents in a dilemmatic situation are never fully relieved of the traces of guilt or sorrow for what they have done, and that is a good thing. It serves as a reminder of our shared vulnerability and woundedness as human subjects. In other words, our actions have effects and the virtuous agent is sensitive to these effects. In the image of Battin's way-station self we see how we are all biologically connected in pathways of disease. In a similar way moral traces remind us of our roles as both subjects and objects.We can see the implications of Battin's metaphysical view in her treatment of the ethics of distribution of scarce medical resources in cases of pandemic emergencies. She concurs with the pandemic triage plans put forth by Canada, Tennessee, and Utah that all base their allocation decisions on \"medical criteria of survivability and need\" (397). However, she notes that the patient as victim and vector (PVV) perspective draws our attention to two additional points. First, these plans fail to give an adequate account of what kind of care those who are \"deprioritized\" receive, and second, existing injustices in health care are exacerbated by these allocation criteria. Consequently, Battin argues that the plans must be clear about the obligation they have to care for those who will not be first in the queue to receive care in such an emergency. The issue of injustice only makes clear that we have an obligation to attend to health care inequities before such emergency situations strike. These conclusions illustrate the importance of the residual obligations incurred in situations of moral conflict. Like Childress's views about the necessity of the jus in bello criteria, and about the importance of public justifications in public health, Battin affirms that overriding a principle leaves traces that are not only wounding to the moral agent but also damaging to the relationships of trust that enable communities to exist and flourish.Without a strong sense of moral traces or even moral regret, we are left with a view of an agent who is not fully accountable to others—who can override important moral norms without having to incur any costs. Moral traces acknowledge the vulnerability and limits of our humanity. Yet it would be a mistake to stop there by allowing such an acknowledgment to turn us inward by focusing exclusively on whether our integrity has been damaged. Moral traces ought to do more than just make us feel bad. They are the impetus for broadcasting our accountability to others by offering reasons for our actions. In the case of the allocation of scarce medical resources, that accountability is necessary for extending and maintaining trust between health care providers and patients. Childress argues that randomness and chance are \"most in accord with this relationship of trust\" (1970, 349). Decisions about who should receive lifesaving treatments based on social worth are not attentive to the long-term effects of our actions on the fundamental relationships that form the basis of our society.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When leaders meet in person, they perform a wide range of interaction rituals. They dress for the occasion, greet each other and shake hands, exchange pleasantries and gifts, arrive at the meeting venue and have themselves seated according to protocol, and so on. What do they make of the performance of such rituals? In this paper, I argue that leaders often take advantage of or outright flout what the sociologist Erving Goffman calls the prevailing ‘ceremonial idiom’ of an interaction – that is the intersubjective understanding they share on what rituals to perform and how to perform them – to realize a number of political and personal objectives, with larger international consequences. The ‘ceremonial idiom’ is deliberately transgressed and a counterpart's ‘face’ threatened – overtly but more often subtly – to achieve what are commonly known as ‘one-upmanship’ and ‘putdowns’ in interpersonal contact. Empirically, I demonstrate my argument with over two dozen episodes of face-to-face diplomacy across six categories of interaction rituals: the identity of leaders, gestural, spatial–physical, task-embedded, linguistic, and communication rules. I also outline several directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "The autobiographical process involves not just reporting on past events, reconstructing one’s life history, but replaying events in different voices and modes. It may be that the autobiographer is motivated by the desire to impose one version of her or his life and to scotch the others. Even then, however, other versions, the ones under erasure, often show through the fabric – the fabrication – and we detect their traces in the turns of the rhetoric. Thus, in autobiography, the real agenda is often underneath, either because a less official motive lurks behind the manifest ones or because what really drives the project of selfscrutiny is something only progressively revealed in the process of writing. This issue takes into consideration the structuring implications of turning points in the account of a life and the roles of the converse forces of forgetting and subjective destabilisation. There are two ways of looking at turning points: either as causative agents of order and coherence or as metaphors – as provisional, semi-fictional, forensic, cognitive instruments. In the latter case, they belong to an active, performative, conjectural, self-revising process, and they complement a version of autobiographical memory that involves a constant interplay of remembering and forgetting.",

My response was: there is no connection between philosophy and torture, still when you look at the fact of torture with philosophical-ethical knowledge, you can realize that torture does not damage, nor ‘degrade’, the human dignity of the victim of torture, as is usually accepted – e.g. in the formulation of the title of the ‘Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’. It causes damage to the human dignity of the person who tortures.

Happiness is not rather in the retention of goods, but in the free possession of them. This rule is emphasized by rare exceptions from it: these include a person's dependence on the good of communication with spiritually close ones, relatives, loved ones, friends.

Changing one's borders is also not unlimited and completely arbitrary. All this must also be learned, because the loss of goods is also bitter, especially if involuntary or, moreover, against our will, and the loss of some goods is the loss of our very life – organic and / or spiritual. Happiness is in the unity of eccentricity and centripetal of some personality: in the constant rejection of the unchanging center and boundaries of one's personality and at the same time in the constant search and new discoveries that partially reaffirm this center and boundaries – but as a result of one's own choice.

The gossip's content usually injures the gossip object's privacy. Gossip is information of which the circulation is not institutionalised: it occurs in an unspecific way. Its time and place of origin generally are unknown. The most typical characteristic is that the contents of gossip are not and/or cannot be verified. In accordance with the laws of 'Gestaltpsychology' the contents change very much as a result of the fact that they are adapted to the narrator's social and psychic context. Functional analysis learns that gossip can be functional as well as dysfunctional for society. From an ethical point of view gossip can be eufunctional as well as kakofunctional and rumours as well true as false. Rumours also can be latently or manifestly functional or dysfunctional, but often they are non-functional.

      "title": "Dead Sorrow: A Story About Loss and a New Theory of Wrongful Death Damages",
      "abstract": "In this “scholarative,” combining personal narrative and traditional doctrinal scholarship, the author uses a story about personal loss to argue for a new type of wrongful death damages.When a tortiously caused death occurs, five losses/injuries result: (1) the decedent’s life itself; (2) the trauma and bereavement suffered by the decedent’s survivors, collectively referred to in this article as “grief;” (3) the pecuniary value of financial and service contributions that the decedent could have been expected to make to his or her dependents; (4) the loss of the decedent’s society and companionship, which in some states is considered a type of pecuniary loss under the fiction that society and companionship are a type of “lost service” with ascertainable monetary value (technically placing such damages in category 3) but which in other states is viewed as an intangible or noneconomic loss; and (5) the direct costs associated with the death, such as funeral expenses.The wrongful death system fails to account for the first two elements. Current law attaches no monetary value to life itself. The second item, grief, traditionally has been the invisible injury from wrongful death. This article proposes a legislative reconceptualization of wrongful death damages that addresses both of the deficiencies described above — for one price. Specifically, it argues that life has independent value apart from what we earn and give to others and that this value should be recognized in the form of “lost life” damages.Departing from the orthodox view that such damages should be allocated to the decedent’s estate or to the survivors, the article instead suggests that damages for the lost value of life be used for the exclusive purpose of establishing a lasting memorial to the decedent. Such a solution would promote both the economic deterrence and corrective justice models of tort law. Additionally, the memorial established with the lost life damages would, at no additional cost, provide a proven grief-healing instrument for all persons who mourn the decedent’s passing. Finally, because it is recommended that memorials created with lost life damages be required to serve a utilitarian function, another unique aspect of the proposal is that it would allocate tort damages in ways that benefit society in addition to tort victims, enhancing the net social benefit of the tort system.",

      "abstract": "Previous accounts of autotopagnosia (e.g., Ogden, 1985; Pick, 1908; Semenza, 1988) propose that the disorder is attributable to deficits in \"mental images,\" visual body schema, or semantic representations. A recent account (Sirigu, Grafman, Bressler, & Sunderland, 1991b) posits deficits in visual structural descriptions of the human body and its parts, in the context of spared semantic and proprioceptivespatio-motor body representations, but provides no evidence bearing on the nature or format of the putatively damaged representation. We report data from a man with autotopagnosia consequent to lefthemisphere brain damage which bear directly on the nature of the representation impaired in the disorder. The subject, GL, is unable to localise body parts on himself or others, whether cued by verbal or visual input. In contrast, he uses body parts precisely in reaching and grasping tasks, correctly matches items of clothing to body parts, and localises the parts of animals and man-made objects without error. We also demonstrate that GL is unable to match pictured or real human body parts across shifts in orientation or changes in visual appearance, but can perform analogous matching tasks with animal body parts and man-made object parts. The data extend the account of Sirigu et al. (1991b) in suggesting that human body part localisation depends upon structural descriptions of human (but not animal) bodies that enable viewpoint-independent body part recognition and participate in the calculation of equivalence between the body parts of self and others across transformations in orientation.",

      "title": "Human Suffering as a Challenge for the Meaning of Life",
      "abstract": "When people suffer they always suffer as a whole human being. The emotional, cognitive and spiritual suffering of human beings cannot be completely separated from all other kinds of suffering, such as from harmful natural, ecological, political, economic and social conditions. In reality they interact with each other and influence each other. Human beings do not only suffer from somatic illnesses, physical pain, and the lack of decent opportunities to satisfy their basic vital, social and emotional needs. They also suffer when they are not able to experience and grasp any meaning of life even if such suffering is not quite as obvious as most forms of physical, social and emotional suffering. Suffering from the lack for the sense of the meaning of life is a special form of emotional, cognitive, and spiritual suffering. Although all human beings share the same basic human need for some meaning of life, the fulfilment of this need is highly individual and personal. Although all forms of human suffering can be a challenge to the meaning of life, the personal conditions of suffering usually are a stronger challenge for the meaning of life. Among the personal conditions of human suffering, the Grenzsituationen cannot be cancelled or raised at all, but only accepted and coped with as existential aspects of the conditio humana. According to Karl Jaspers these are: death, suffering, struggling, guilt, and failing. The challenge for human beings to cope with these Grenzsituationen is a way to move from the mere Being-there to true human Existence. 1",

      "title": "The Harm of Neglecting Embodiment: How Biomedical Ethics’ Neglect of Bodies and Context Hurts Women and Minorities",
      "abstract": "ions of the mind, as Plato did so long ago, is a disservice because it asks us to reject This is not meant to diminish the fact that some people do feel trapped in their body either because of the extreme pain or because it feels like the wrong body for one reason or another. I would suggest, however, that perhaps much of this imagery of feeling trapped is due to the dissociation that is taught in a dualistic society (or even that dissociation which is necessary to survive mentally in a dualized community that is itself rejecting). Perhaps this dissociation makes people believe that not only are the two parts separable, but that the body is generally responsible for their negative experiences. Less dissociation and more acceptance of people as whole and situated individuals, might well lessen these experiences which mirror this artificial but current state of the society generally–but such is only possible in a world that accepts bodies and human variation. 77 important aspects of ourselves, of others and our connections to them, and makes it impossible for us to come to terms with ourselves as whole, integrated and bodily beings. The fact that dualisms still exist may seem unimpressive to some, just as the believed existence of yin and yang does not seem especially problematic to some Eastern thinkers. The point that women are associated with one side of this dualism, the side that is less valued, is unfortunate for them but does not in itself adequately refute dualism as a concept and means of understanding the world, such thinkers might argue. I think there is sufficient evidence that the harm dualism does, and the inequalities it produces, is at least adequate to challenge its usefulness and fairness. Even those readers who might reject these points surely could not easily maintain that dualism is an accurate account of human experience as it exists in the world. Granted many people believe that their mind and body are quite separate in some way, but the opinions of the masses are not in themselves adequate proof, one might think. However the average person does not experience their body as radically separate from themselves. One does not generally seek out or welcome a means of killing the body such that their immortal mind might be free to do more important things than the material tasks of maintaining a body. People experience their bodies as themselves. When physical pain is experienced–it is not just reasoned away and when psychic or emotional pain is experienced, often the body reflects that anguish. It is not just my mind that decides if I feel happy today but also my body which is me as well. The next chapter will discuss",

Identification and relationship become possible if the therapist is attuned to their rhythm, usually very slow and delicate. Comments on the interior experiences also help to regulate experiences that are too intense or fracturing, either at a sensory, emotional, or relationship level.

      "abstract": "The fields of philosophical anthropology and the ethics of personalism overlap in the area of many difficult personal situations involving clinical toxicology. These therapeutic situations need an integral, multidimensional, and personal approach for both the patient and the toxicologist. This means that man is treated not only as a physical (biological) being but also there is an appreciation for the mental sphere, which includes rational, emotional, and spiritual elements while not forgetting that the human person is also part of the human community. Studying such an individual's personal decision as suicide, we must realize that it's not just physiological or biochemical poisons but also includes the poisoning of the psyche, as well as poisoning relationships with loved ones (family), poisoning social relations (in school or the workplace) and poisoning the spirit, in other words, there is no meaning in life itself, nor the meaning of God's existence, nor the meaning of faith, hope and love. Not only is there a greater \"variety of poisons\" than before, they are much more extensive and deep. For example, we can name environmental pollution, industrial poisons, chemical waste, genetic modification, powerful medications, or even the toxic social environment of evil ideas, malicious manipulation of the human mind (destructive religious sects). In approaching the challenges of clinical toxicology, the doctor must not only be a specialist in chemistry, biochemistry and pharmacology. What then is of future of toxicology because of this human dimension (anthropological, ethical and spiritual) of this teaching? As today marks the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the Clinic of Toxicology CM UJ, should we shape the ethos of young doctors who want to deal with toxicology seriously?",

It may also occur following loss or may arise from intrapsychic conflict, as in conflict between inner drives and external demands or between conflicting value systems. Anxiety is a distressing emotion usually associated with bodily discomfort. In contrast to depression, which is a reaction to loss and is oriented toward the past, anxiety is a reaction to threat and is directed toward the future. The threat may involve danger, lack of support or what is unknown. Normal anxiety prepares the individual for a protective response. Low levels of anxiety are helpful in coping with adversity, but high levels cause impairment and can even be disorganizing. Anxiety becomes abnormal when its intensity and duration are disproportionate to the potential for harm, when it occurs in situations known to be harmless, or occurs without any recognizable threat.",

      "abstract": "“We all aspire to talk, to dialogue in a world shaken by multimedia communication, but which paradoxically establishes an impersonal silence. Everything happens as if we didn’t transmit the main point.” (Raoul Pantanella) Human groups organize and maintain themselves thanks to believes, opinions, prejudices common to all the members that make them up. However, not only the personality features of the subjects have repercussions over the group, but also the group influences the individual. Within the group, man learns to adopt an attitude towards the others, to time him to the circumstances, to see him in others – opportunity of personal probing, of rediscovering and awareness of the difference between what we believe we are and what we really are. As soon as man passes beyond the immediate knowledge, through sensations, as soon as he tears himself away from what it is given by the direct experience, by his memories, he disposes of two ways of drawing up explanations, of making assumptions and anticipations, of reasoning or imagining things. There are a logic of reasons and a logic of feelings; the last one – the most frequent in the individual and social life – is not a residuum of the other one, but it has a structure and a reason of its own. Man represents a complex informational and communicative structure. He emits, intercepts and remakes information; he is source and receiver in the same time. Physically and biologically programmed, he is source of information and receiver; he transmits, receives, remakes information and includes it into his own structures. He cannot live outside the communication, communication being the sense, the support and the reason of being. The content of communication, reflected by the way of thinking, by the logical rigour and correctness, by mental attitudes, represents the decisive factor, which gives sense and relevance to the communication. The psychic inner, culturally shaped, acquired through education and self-education, represents the real basis of the communication’s efficiency, succeed and success. In a certain way, relations are like games, having in view certain purposes and including rules, which define the roles the persons in relation with it must perform.",

      "abstract": "The body's internal timekeeping system is an under-recognized but highly influential force in behaviors and emotions including anger and reactive aggression. Predictable cycles or rhythms in behavior are expressed on several different time scales such as circadian (circa diem, or approximately 24-hour rhythms) and infradian (exceeding 24 hours, such as monthly or seasonal cycles). The circadian timekeeping system underlying rhythmic behaviors in mammals is constituted by a network of clocks distributed throughout the brain and body, the activity of which synchronizes to a central pacemaker, or master clock. Our daily experiences with the external environment including social activity strongly influence the clock mechanism operates at the level of our genes, but its exact timing of this network is synchronized by our experiences with the external environment including social activity. In the present review, we examine evidence from a number of species and propose that anger and reactive aggression interact in multiple ways with circadian clocks. Specifically, we argue that i) there are predictable rhythms in the expression of aggression and anger, ii) disruptions of the normal functioning of the body clock circadian system increase the likelihood of aggressive behaviors, and iii) conversely, chronic expression of anger can disrupt normal rhythmic cycles of physiological activities and create conditions for pathologies such as cardiovascular disease to develop. Taken together, these observations suggest that a comprehensive perspective on anger and reactive aggression must incorporate an understanding of the role of the body circadian timing system in these intense affective states.",

      "abstract": "What is it for one thing to affect or to act on another? Examples come to mind: bending a bar of iron, moving a ball, melting wax. But there are other relationships one can have with an iron bar: one can also look at it, think about it, want it, approach it. Are not these too kinds of doing to it? We might say: even thinking about something is treating it in a certain way. Yet we should hardly admit that thought, sight, desire, and approaching affect or act on their objects. If we want to say that these are ways of treating things, then we have to say that not all cases of treating things are cases of affecting them. To put it in the formal mode: not every transitive verb ‘φ’, i.e. not every verb ‘φ’ with active and passive voices, is such that ‘x φs y’ entails ‘x acts on or affects y’. Let us call the values of ‘φ’ for which this entailment does hold, affective verbs, and those for which it does not, non-affective. Now the question of this paper is: what are the logical characteristics of affective, as opposed to non-affective, verbs? Or to put it in the material mode, using the term ‘operation’ neutrally: what are the logical characteristics of affective as opposed to non-affective operations?",

The chapter defines as a comment an informative communicative act, performed by either verbal or bodily signals, that gives nonrequested additional and pertinent information. A comment may be produced by the present interlocutor or the third listener by means of body signals. Various facial, gestural, and bodily comments are overviewed in political debates, highlighting their use mainly as a subtle, unwarranted but clear way to discredit people during debates: their senders take advantage of their being framed on the screen, to convey their opinions while somehow violating turn-taking norms.",

Indeed, as living, embodied beings, we cannot not be responsive in some fashion to the expressions of others (spoken, written, or otherwise), and to other kinds of events, occurring in our immediate surroundings. In this article I outline methods for exploring the unfolding dynamics of our utterances in their speaking and how they can give rise to a ‘shaped’ and ‘vectored’ sense of our moment-by-moment changing placement within the situation of our talk – engendering in us both unique anticipations as to what-next might happen along with, so to speak, ‘action-guiding advisories’ as to what-next we might do.",

Since he has the power to assimilate concepts of morality in the cerebral cortex, and since the cortex is one of the factors which can initiate, facilitate, or inhibit his response, man is a positive and responsible agent rather than a passive puppet in the self-society nexus. In a subsequent article I shall show how mental disorder, alcoholism, and other conditions (and their therapy) can be interpreted in terms of reciprocal complementarity. I hope to demonstrate that at least some of the seeming contradictions in such conditions which cannot be explained by conventional cause and effect nor in terms of antagonism between emotional drives and the social controls can be explained in terms of circular causality and complementarity between man and the social codes through which he functions.",

For this reason, it is said that the existence of conflict is as old as the world, which is an ingredient of everyday individuals; some of them seem to be born for the simple reason to cause conflicts, and others to address them. Most of us are afraid of conflicts, so that when we feel we are close to this phenomenon, try, wherever possible, to avoid, to postpone any decision related to it, and for this reason, conflicting situations are put directly related stress, the psychological discomfort and other tensions that they can cause. We have chosen to address this issue because conflicts have a strong impact on our society, the time which focuses much research of psychologists, sociologists, legal practitioners, etc., and from my point of view, as a specialist in communication, conflict is as important as communication is a feature of the living world, and for this reason it is important that we know how to design appropriate behavior, as a means to respond to conflict and be able to distinguish between functional and dysfunctional conflicts , the first to generate, and the latter avoid them.",

      "abstract": "Physical inactivity and a passive lifestyle induce a plethora of negative effects on human physical and mental health. Physical activity is a fundamental human necessity as it enables the preservation of a healthy organism and its organ systems. Recreation entails every form of body movement that increases energy consumption while the body is in the state of inaction. It encompasses fitness, training, and competition, house chores, and other activities that require bodily exertion. Regular implementation of physical activity can benefit overall health and lower the probability of chronic illnesses. However, the lack of recreation presents a globally spread problem. Physical inactivity is a state of insufficient activity, whether it is inadequate with its intensity, length, and/or frequency; its insufficiency disables normal performance of different organs, metabolic regulation processes, construction, and maintenance of non-fat body mass, and preservation of motor abilities. The quality of life is mostly defined as an overall estimation or a personal perspective of an individual with regard to the entire welfare and pleasures of life. The usual understanding of lifestyle quality based on health factors is established on the definition of the WHO; the quality of life is therefore construed as the state of complete physical, mental and social welfare, not just the absence of illness and inability. The aim of this study was to determine the level of activity and quality of life of the working population.",

      "abstract": "Based on a phenomenological understanding of humans as situated and intentional beings, this study explored experience of late-stage Parkinson's disease. A woman aged 72, in the late stages of Parkinson's disease, was interviewed regarding her experiences over a five-year period. A phenomenological method was used for scrutinizing tape-recorded and verbatim transcribed interviews. Results reveal that late-stage Parkinson's disease is manifested as a sense of lost control over daily life and as a life with unpredictable bodily reactions. There was a demand to live within an increasingly rigid, slow rhythm of time, with continuously decreased embodied skilfulness, which caused fragmented mobility patterns. Movements were no longer intentional, i.e. outward; they demanded inward concentration. The intention to move was no longer primary, e.g. to grab a handle, because space is mentally and physically understood. Instead, intention was secondary because movement became primary. This phenomenon changed embodied understanding of relationships with the room, distances, and things. Understanding of distance, e.g. became unclear, and this affected ways in which place and situation were experienced and lived. The results highlight ways that a Parkinson's sufferer lives and experiences space and time in surroundings and situations; and how the person meets and deals with significant challenges.",

      "title": "AT THE BOUNDARIES OF BEING: RE-FIGURING INTELLECTUAL LIFE",
      "abstract": "Is there a place to go beyond Socia l Constructionism? Is there yet further progress to be made? I think there is. But rather than trying to move forward, to bring new forms of relational practices into existence, I think we must move backward. We must first come to a much greater awareness of or sensitivity to the very strange nature of the relational practices already occurring between us and the othernesses around us now, at this very moment. As living, embodied beings (as 'open' systems) we cannot help but be spontaneously responsive to e vents occurring around us. But, in being responsive in this way, not only is there a complex intertwining of our own outgoing responsive activities with those coming into us from 'out there', but it is just within this intertwining, according to how moment by moment we focus our attention, that a space 'out there' with a 'depth' (of possibilities) to it is created. Strange things happen at the point of contact in two or more different forms of life with each other - another collective form of life with its own unique world and character (a culture?) emerges. As Bakhtin (1984) remarks, it is just in the meeting of a plurality of unmerged consciousnesses, each with its own world, that such a (dialogically - structured) space is created. Just as two different, 2 -D monocular points of view are not merged into another 'averaged' 2 -D point of view, but into a binocular 3 -D 'world' - a 'world' that both offers us certain opportunities for our own chosen actions while also exerting certain calls upon us to which we must, spontaneously, respond - so similar such 'worlds' are created in all our relational practices. Their unique nature can, however, only be experienced and understood from within the practices in which they are created. Thus to investigate their nature, th eir structure, the calls they exert on us, what is possible for us within them and what is not, we need some utterly new methods of investigation , quite different from the 'onlooker' methods inherited from the natural sciences. The writings of Bakhtin, Wittgenstein, and Merleau-Ponty give us much help in devising such methods. Nothing less than the re-figuring of our intellectual lives together is required if we are to understand the strange nature of our relational practices. Man has to awake to wonder - and so perhaps do peoples. Science is a way of sending him to sleep again (Wittgenstein, 1980, p.5).",

      "title": "Human Consciousness: Where Is It From and What Is It for",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is not a process in the brain but a kind of behavior that, of course, is controlled by the brain like any other behavior. Human consciousness emerges on the interface between three components of animal behavior: communication, play, and the use of tools. All three do not exclusively distinguish our close relatives, i.e., primates, but are broadly presented among various species of mammals, birds, and even cephalopods. These three components interact on the basis of anticipatory behavioral control, which is common for all complex forms of animal life. The interaction between communication and play yields symbolic games, the most important of which being language; the interaction between symbols and tools results in human praxis. Taken together, this gives rise to a mechanism that allows a creature, instead of performing controlling actions overtly, to play forward the corresponding behavioural options in a \"second reality\" of objectively (by means of tools) grounded symbolic systems. The theory possesses the following properties: 1. It is explicitly anti-reductionistic and anti-eliminativistic, and yet, human consciousness is considered as a purely natural (biological) phenomenon. 2. It avoids epiphenomenalism and indicates in which conditions human consciousness has evolutionary advantages, and in which it may even be disadvantageous. 3. It allows to easily explain the most typical features of consciousness, such as objectivity, seriality and limited resources, the relationship between consciousness and explicit memory, the feeling of conscious agency, etc. The relationships between the present model and other, traditional and modern, theories of consciousness, from substance dualism to Dennett's reductionism and Baars' Common Workspace model, remains a topic of a following analysis.",

      "title": "The Forgotten Message of the Infant Smile.",
      "abstract": "Few developmental phenomena enjoy the universality, inevitabil ity, and temporal determinancy of the infant smile—features that beguile the layman and bedevil the experimenter. In attempting to account for the various factors that control smiling and the it plays in human behavior, we face immediately the communication vs. expression issue, the question of whether to emphasize the effect of smiling on outsiders or the meaning of smiling for the insider, a simple point often overlooked or confused in the literature. Consider first the adult smile. As an outsider, we interpret the smile of another person (leaving aside the rare nervous smile) to mean simply that he has experienced a positive change in feeling. It may be because he is happy to see us, because he has appreciated a twist of humor, because he has mastered a problem, and so on. The social role of the smile here is to communicate to others something about the in feeling of the smiler. To the insider, if my introspections have any validity, the outsider's perceptions are fairly veridical. Treatments of infant smiling have traditionally weighed heavily the external aspects of smiling, one of which is the effect of infant smiling on others. Bowlby (1969) has rightly pointed out the value of smiling for the attachment of mother to infant. I would claim, inci dentally, that this virtue is not unique to the infant; people tend throughout life to be attracted to smilers no matter what their age. Another effect of the infant smile is to signal others that they are doing something right; mothers, fathers, and siblings will perform any number of antics to maintain the infant smile. A second ex ternal aspect of smiling has interested investigators. Smiling has frequently been treated relatively mechanically as either a triggered response, in the ethological tradition, to eyes, to faces, to voices, to jouncing or, in the operant tradition, as a response to be reinforced or extinguished. Amazingly enough, little has been said about what the smile",

      "title": "Meeting infant affect.",
      "abstract": "Emotions remain something of a mystery for most of us even when we accept their centrality to development in general and to infancy in particular. I make 2 arguments in this paper. One: that the most crucial thing about emotions is that they allow mutuality of engagement with other emotional beings-not only evoking responses, but also provoking further emotions in others. Mutual engagements-sometimes called moments of meeting or encounters with other minds-can be transformational. They allow us to be \"seen,\" to be \"known\" by others, and in achieving that, they allow us to be persons. Some key phenomena of emotional encounters in infancy are discussed to illustrate this point. Evidence of such meetings is abundant in our lives and needs a committed focus for study within developmental psychology. Two: that we need to open out the idea of emotions (as well as probe at a microlevel) and the terms affect or affectivity might help encompass a greater breadth. Daniel Stern's \"vitality affects\" and Ben Anderson's \"affective atmospheres\" both cross disciplinary boundaries in contemplating emotional phenomena. It seems crucial for developmental psychology to incorporate such different aspects-neurological, kinematic, situational and sociopolitical-into discussions of emotional development.

      "abstract": "Mathematical biologists have failed to produce a satisfactory general model for evolution of altruism, i.e., of behaviors by which altruists benefit other individuals but not themselves; kin selection does not seem to be a sufficient explanation of nonreciprocal altruism. Nonmathematical (but mathematically accept- able) models are now proposed for evolution of negative in dual-determinant and of positive in tri-determinant systems. Peck orders, territorial systems, and an ant society are analyzed as examples. In all models, evolution is primarily by individual selection, probably supplemented by group selection. Group selection is differential extinction of populations. It can act only on populations preformed by selection at the individual level, but can either cancel individual selective trends (effecting evolutionary homeostasis) or supplement them; its supple- mentary effect is probably increasingly important in the evolution of increasingly organized populations. Biological altruism, broadly defined, includes all behaviors by which some individuals benefit others of the same species, without benefiting themselves. The benefits may be voluntary or involuntary and direct or indirect: e.g., genetic shortening of life spans is if it prevents older individuals fromi competing to the disadvantage of younger ones. (But re- ciprocal altruism (1) is not by this definition, be- cause probabilities of benefits are mutual.) More broadly, is concerned with the relation of individuals to the populations they belong to, and is involved in the organiza- tion and evolution of social systems of insects and other animals and, of course, of men. The extent to which occurs in nonhuman, as well as in human, populations, and how it does or may evolve, are therefore important questions,",

      "title": "Adapting Ourselves, Instead of the Environment: An Inquiry into Human Enhancement for Function and Beyond",
      "abstract": "Abstract Technology enables humans not only to adapt their environment to their needs but also to modify themselves. Means of Human Enhancement — embodied technologies to improve the human body’s capabilities or to create a new one — are the designated means of adapting ourselves instead of the environment. The debate about these technologies is typically fought on ethical soil. However, alarmist, utopian, and science fiction scenarios distract from the fact that Human Enhancement is a historical and pervasive phenomenon incorporated into many everyday practices. In the vein of disentangling conceptual difficulties, we claim that means of Human Enhancement are either physiologically or psychologically embodied, rendering the merging with the human user their most defining aspect. To fulfill its purpose, an enhancement must pass the test-in-the-world, i.e., assisting with effective engagement with a dynamic world. Even if failing in this regard: Human Enhancement is the fundamental and semi-targeted process of changing the users relationship with the world through the physical or psychological embodiment of a hitherto external object and/or change of one’s body. This can potentially change the notion of being human. Drawing on a rich body of theoretical and empirical literature, we aim to provide a nuanced analysis of the transformative nature of this phenomenon in close proximity to human practice. Stakeholders are invited to apply the theory presented here to interrogate their perspective on technology in general and Human Enhancement in particular.",

      "abstract": "Human interaction with nonhuman animals is a central feature of contemporary social life. Despite the fact that human interactions with animals are commonplace, they have, until fairly recently, been virtually ignored within sociology. This prosaic disregard of human–animal exchanges is based on a variety of core assumptions. Sociology is conventionally seen as the study of human social structures and relationships; sociologists hold to the Cartesian linguacentric assumption that, because animals lack the ability to employ spoken language, they are consequently mindless and selfless; and, as Arnold Arluke (2003) has observed, sociologists who specialize in the investigation of inequality and oppression tend to be suspicious of the study of nonhuman animals because it may be seen as trivializing human concerns.",

      "abstract": "Fear is a very strong stressor, and the highly variable results of handling and transportation studies are likely to be due to different levels of psychological stress. Psychological stress is fear stress. Some examples are restraint, contact with people, or exposure to novelty. In many different animals, stimulation of the amygdala with an implanted electrode triggers a complex pattern of behavior and autonomic responses that resemble fear in humans. Both previous experience and genetic factors affecting temperament will interact in complex ways to determine how fearful an animal may become when it is handled or transported. Cattle trained and habituated to a squeeze chute may have baseline cortisol levels and be behaviorally calm, whereas extensively reared animals may have elevated cortisol levels in the same squeeze chute. The squeeze chute is perceived as neutral and non-threatening to one animal; to another animal, the novelty of it may trigger intense fear. Novelty is a strong stressor when an animal is suddenly confronted with it. To accurately assess an animal's reaction, a combination of behavioral and physiological measurements will provide the best overall measurement of animal discomfort.",

      "abstract": "The most important experience of others takes place in the face-to-face situation, which is the prototypical case of social interaction. All other cases are derivatives of it. The typifications of social interaction become progressively anonymous the farther away they are from the face-to-face situation. An important aspect of the experience of others in everyday life is thus the directness or indirectness of such experience. The social reality of everyday life is thus apprehended in a continuum of typifications, which are progressively anonymous as they are removed from the \"here and now\" of the face-to-face situation. Social structure is the sum total of these typifications and of the recurrent patterns of interaction established by means of them. Human expressivity is capable of objectivation, that is, it manifests itself in products of human activity that are available both to their producers and to other men as elements of a common world.",

The theophanies therefore remain eminently in the sphere of the subjective and the indemonstrable (physically). But undisputed acceptance characterizes their social impact. In Mesopotamian myths there are few, but famous, examples, such as Atramhasis or Utnapishtim in their confrontation with Ea, Gilgamesh in his encounter with Ishtar or Adapa in his encounter with Ea and Anum.

      "abstract": "Grief is often thought of as an emotional response to the death of someone we love. However, the term “grief” is also used when referring to losses of various other kinds, as with grief over illness, injury, unemployment, diminished abilities, relationship breakups, or loss of significant personal possessions. Complementing such uses, we propose that grief over a bereavement and other experiences of loss share a common phenomenological structure: one experiences the loss of certain possibilities that were integral to—and perhaps central to—the unfolding structure of one’s life. Grief can thus be conceived of in a broad but still univocal way. To develop this position, we focus on the example of grief over involuntary childlessness, where lack of a concrete, historical object of emotion serves to make explicit the way in which grief concerns future possibilities. We go on to suggest that the phenomenological complexity, diversity, and prevalence of grief are obscured when approached via an abstract, simplified conception of bereavement.",

Because her every action is determined by the goal of maximizing the impersonal good, a consequentialist cannot use her actions (including actions of speech) to express her feelings for her fellows. I argue that we should expect this problem to afflict sophisticated as well as straightforward consequentialism.

One cannot control emotions or physical reactions, so they are unintentional. Undesirable outcomes like bankrupt also are unintentional. However, even intentional actions such as stare at somebody can become unintentional in FOC. Next, another property of FOC: [+surprising] is examined and the discussion leads to whether the recognition is expressed in real time or not in the scenes presented. Non-real time recognitions are situations expressed in negatives, interrogatives, and subordinate clauses, and hypothetical or generalized situations. In FOC, it is not the speaker but the subject that recognizes the occurring situation, which effectively gives some reality to the sentence.",

      "title": "Reaching Sideways, Writing <i>Our</i> Ways",
      "abstract": "Ruth Simbao: In Rehema Chachage's video installation, Kwa Baba Rithi Undugu (2010), sculptural objects representing old-fashioned transistor radios are mounted on the wall, side by side (Fig. 1). Embedded in each radio is a small video screen, which reveals a figure who stands in one place while the vertical line of the radio tuner crosses her body in search of the desired frequency (Figs. 2–3). A man's voice wafts in and out as it is periodically interrupted by unsolicited noise, revealing the difficulty of relating to others when sound is interrupted or there is an absence of voice. Voice, writes Chachage, is a “prerequisite for interlocution and the construction of discourse.”2 This work engages with the assertion that to “live means to participate in dialogue: to ask questions, to heed, to respond, to agree …” and to do so full heartedly with your “eyes, lips, hands, soul, spirit … whole body and deeds” (Bakhtin 1984:293).3Rehema Chachage, a Dar es Salaam-based artist who works with video, installation, and performance, explains that her work is predominantly determined by her situatedness. Her early work draws from her time spent as a student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa and she describes experiencing this situation as a “‘cultural foreigner’ and a non-South African, black female student in a predominantly white middle class … institution.” At this time, she says, her work was produced from “the point of view of a stranger, the outsider, the other, alien and often voiceless.”4Chachage's concern with dialogue and voice in Kwa Baba Rithi Undungu serves as an effective inroad into a multivocal conversation in the context of a scholarly journal, for “Without dialogue there is no communication, and without communication there can be no true education” (Freire 2005:92–93). Dialogue, writes Paolo Freire (2005:88–91), is about horizontal relationships; it is an existential necessity and an act of creation rather than an instrument of domination of one person over another. When one listens to a radio, voices can be tuned out selectively. Opinions exist as waves out there, but statements can be blocked with the turn of a dial. At times there is a crackle—a disruption of signal or an interference caused by the receiver. If one were to hold an old transmitter radio, one could attempt to receive better sound if one moved around, changing one's orientation.This multivocal dialogue reaches sideways as it opens up the dominant international discourse5 of the arts of Africa to include a higher percentage of voices from the African continent. (Participating writers are based in Zambia, Nigeria, Benin, Zimbabwe, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, the US, Egypt, Tanzania, and Angola/Portugal.) This sideways reach registers the importance of intracontinental conversations in Africa that are sometimes missing from internationally visible scholarship on the arts of Africa, and it asks how scholars in the global South and the global North6 can benefit from a reconsideration of what the predominant orientation of our scholarly discourse is.A common understanding of the word “orientation” is one's position relative to, for example, the points of the compass, and its meaning in the nineteenth century was the “arrangement of a building etc. to face east or another specific direction.”7 The etymology of “orientation” links the word historically to the notion of facing East (hence the label of “the Orient” for “places in the East”), implying a particular position from which one views the world and thereby develops a certain standpoint. This dialogue attempts to encourage an understanding of orientation that situates speaking positions and gives credence to the physical positioning of knowing subjects, whilst also expanding beyond physical coordinates, seeking richer understandings of the orientation of our research.What is the orientation of the international discourse of the arts of Africa in the twenty-first century and what position do we see this discourse in relation to? In what ways might it matter that the vast majority of authors in journals such as African Arts and NKA: Journal of Contemporary African Art are based in the North? (See “Situating Africa: A Geopolitics of Knowledge, or Chapungu Rises” in this issue). In his thought-piece “What Is an African Curriculum?” Harry Garuba (2015) discusses the activism of James Ngũgĩ (now Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o), Henry Owuor-Anyumba, and Taban Lo Liyong at the University of Nairobi who fought for the decolonization of the curriculum in the 1960s. Garuba (2015) argues that it was “place, perspective, and orientation” that needed to be addressed in order to position “Kenya, East Africa, and Africa” at the center of knowledge-production in newly independent Kenya. In this current moment of revived activism in Africa regarding the “politics of knowing” (Ngũgĩ 2012), what can we learn about historical calls for reorientation? Are there ways that we can hear contributions of other scholars more effectively if we adjust our orientation? Can we reduce the crackle that sometimes surfaces in the discourse if we shift our respective positions?This dialogue places an emphasis on the voices of scholars, artists, and curators based on the African continent, as it marks the start of an Africa-based editorial consortium partnership with African Arts.8 The dialogue is neither definitive, nor complete. Instead, it is a departure point that invites further conversation from people who, together, desire to learn more than we now know about our field of research and our respective roles in generating new knowledge. What is our view on the strength of the current scholarship on the visual and performing arts, and from what standpoint have we developed this view? How can we discuss various orientations and in doing so work towards generating scholarly knowledge and artistic practice that is more rigorous and diverse, and is relevant to different locally embedded and interconnected contexts?William B. Miko: Africa is like an absent landlord in most dialogues and discourses relating to her own arts. This African Arts discussion aims to turn a new page on scholarship and knowledge-generation, which has largely been produced and propagated by and with an “outsider's” point of view. Usually, when an opportunity for an African scholar arises to study the arts of the continent, the curriculum that is used remains foreign, thereby shrouding scholarship and keeping the knowledge of Africans in obscurity. How can an African scholar living and working on the continent today still ascribe to and perpetuate this status quo? (By “African” I mean every scholar living on the African continent or in the African diaspora, without engaging in dichotomies of skin color, creed, or ethnicity). The question is: Who needs to shift the production of knowledge about Africa and what are the engines and spaces of production of this knowledge? As I discuss further below, it is critical for Africans to be at the forefront of this shift.Eyitayo Tolulope Ijisakin: While one cannot but give credence to some Africanists and non-African writers who have played a role in laying the foundation for scholarship in the visual and performing arts of Africa as an internationally recognized field of research, it is critical to acknowledge that the West still largely dictates the rhythm of art scholarship in postcolonial Africa. Many critics and art historians (including some African scholars residing in the West) continue to apply predominantly Western considerations to the analysis of “contemporary African art.” Furthermore, a number of African artists who are celebrated in the West are not particularly popular or well-known in their own countries in Africa. Their works are seen as visual representations of African thought, but in some ways this gives an inaccurate impression of African intelligence and artistic dexterity.In rethinking the ways in which Africa is positioned in relation to the arts and beyond, I strongly suggest the use of the philosophies of African people in the critical discourse and analysis of their arts. African subject matter and cultural symbols that are deeply meaningful to an expression of African identity should be engaged with more often, and in my view it is only the person who is deeply immersed in a particular culture that is well-placed to advance the purpose of that research.At this point, we have not seen the emergence of sufficient momentum and quality of scholarship that could meaningfully challenge and positively shift this Western dominance. This is partly due to the challenges scholars on the continent face in terms of publishing, such as inadequate financial support and limited publishing outlets. Locally produced publications that meet international standards and benefit from the visibility of wide geographic distribution are rare. That said, scholarship and artistic practice that is rigorous, diverse, and meaningful, I think, can be generated by African scholars.Romuald Tchibozo (translated by Jean-Sylvain Tshilumba Mukendi): I don't think that much has fundamentally changed in recent years regarding Africa's positioning in the world. Our fellow researchers in Africa haven't progressed sufficiently, and researchers based in the South continue to be viewed as appendices to research programs developed elsewhere. Research projects are often formulated without consultation, and without cooperative agreements regarding the mutual interests of both parties. The result is that other people write and think on our behalf. In my opinion, there is only one thing to do: we need to create research funds on the continent and facilitate work exchanges between Southern-based researchers in order to formulate new concepts. This has the potential to meaningfully change the gaze of other scholars and to shift the global positioning of African researchers and artists.We need to develop a better overview of the various platforms that grant scholarships in Africa, and it is important to share knowledge about funding that is specifically for writers and practitioners who are based on the African continent. This would play a significant role in challenging the perception that one needs to be located outside of Africa in order to be recognized. Scholarship-holders and other scholars could develop broad research themes every three years, and by identifying active researchers we could collaborate more and move beyond hierarchical differentiations between African researchers who are from different African contexts and who speak different languages. We could also develop a professional association of international standing in Africa that is able to defend theoretical and conceptual choices regarding the study of the arts in Africa.William B. Miko: Returning to my earlier point about Africans being at the forefront of shifts in knowledge production, I provide a relevant example from my own context in Zambia. Zambia gained independence over fifty years ago, but until 2010 there was not a single university that offered a Fine Arts degree. The Zambian Open University (ZAOU), which was founded in 2005, created the first university-level arts degree at the School of Media, Performing, and Fine Arts. With tenacity in the face of much doubt, I played a key role in establishing this Open Distance Learning (ODL) art school. Many argued that art cannot be taught in an ODL system, but in my view this perpetuates established colonial notions of education designed to prevent the “other” from excelling.Colonization has its own fair share of mental constrictions in the formerly colonized person's mind. What is from the West is often perceived as good even if it was initially taken from Africa, repackaged in the West, and brought back to the continent. Unfortunately some contemporary artists hold this viewpoint and think that it is more prestigious to study abroad, and they have little knowledge of their own national art history.Students at the ZAOU art school learn through a combination of contact periods and distance learning, and we bring together formal university education and engagement with the non-formal sector and practicing artists. During contact periods we visit local art collections and art platforms, such as Chaminuka Lodge, the Lusaka National Museum, Namwandwe Gallery, Lechwe Trust, Henry Tayali Centre, and Twaya Art Gallery. We also visit many artists’ studios and community-based art initiatives. The academic progression observed in students has been amazing—one has to see this modus operandi in motion to believe in its success in a developing nation with limited resources. My philosophy is, “It can only be done for you if you do it yourself; the rest will join in on the way.”The first cohort of students graduated in September 2014, and to mark this momentous event I produced a public performance with my students at the graduation ceremony in Lusaka. I purchased a new white Pier Luigi suit, and during the ceremony the graduating students transformed the suit into a “human canvas” with paints and brushes hidden in their graduation gowns (Fig. 4). Dancing to traditional music performed by the theater and drama students, they signed their names on the suit, registering their role in creating a new space in the production of academic knowledge in the arts. Some of these undergraduates are currently pursuing their Master's degrees, and together we are asserting ourselves by generating scholarship, knowledge, and artistic practice that is rigorous and relevant—first to ourselves in Zambia and secondly to the rest of the world.Ruth Simbao: At this critical time of ongoing and revived calls on the African continent for decoloniality, it is evident that not enough has changed in terms of the way the world imagines, views, frames, and consumes Africa, subsuming the complexitites of its numerous contexts. How can we continue to rethink the ways in which Africa is positioned in relation to the broader artworld? To what degree do external forces continue to shape artworks, artists, and theories, and what alternative forces already exist? Whose agency is exerted and recognized? As Masimba Hwati asks: Who pushes the wheelbarrow?Masimba Hwati: The way that Africa and its contexts continue to be imagined and seen by other groups of people is problematic, because commercial motives tend to lie at the heart of political and cultural engineering of representations of Africa. Due to ongoing perceptions of Africa as a dangerous and poor place, artists from Africa are burdened with the political pressure to appease the ill-informed appetites of collectors and curators. Being an African artist or an artist from an African context is often a negotiation of history itself and a constant navigation of the various images associated with the word “Africa.” In my engagement with different Occidental cultural platforms, I find that sometimes people view my artwork through distorted lenses. At times this challenge can transform into positive processes of dialogue that can become an extension of the work.Unfortunately, there remains a persistent preconceptualization of art from Africa as “tribal,” “ritualistic,” and “functional.” This does not mean that Occidental authors have not played a positive role in negotiating the image of Africa as a cultural space. There are quite a number of credible critical reviews on art from Africa by various writers who are not from Africa and who succeed in countering erroneous images. However, the onus also rests on writers on the African continent to challenge certain bodies of knowledge created about Africa, and it is critical that this is not just done in a reactive way, but in proactive ways such as creating more critical platforms that are not insular in nature but are inclusive of multiple audiences.This raises important questions around the definitions and parameters of curatorship as an institution and its potential to reform or to perpetuate the problematic images of the African continent, which has become a cultural albatross. This question becomes critical as we explore the sources of funding that are available for some of the major curatorial projects on the continent. Most funding from former colonial masters’ countries creates a fundamentally problematic situation for the arts on the continent in terms of agency and dependency, hence the need for more African-funded curatorial projects on the continent. Many foreign policies treat the African continent as an entity that moves only by external pressure.In my artwork I use the wheelbarrow to symbolize a lack of agency, as it is an inert apparatus that requires external force to move it. The wheelbarrow appears in the form of a wheelbarrow-table in the installation Don't Worry, Be Happy exhibited in “Consuming Us” at the 2016 Cape Town Art Fair [see p. 7, Fig. 10 in this issue]. It also appears in the installation “Rinamanyanga Hariputirwe” exhibited at SMAC Gallery (Fig. 5). The title of this recent work refers to a Karanga proverb that can be loosely translated as “that which has horns cannot be wrapped,” alluding to the idea that the truth will always come out or that nature will always mete out vengeance and eventually provide a balance.Through the hybridity of form and symbolism, such as the wheelbarrow-table or the wheelbarrow-boxing bag, I explore the absurdity of definition and containment. The boxing bag is an object designed to be punched or pummeled. It's an object of appropriation and fantasy; an object of training and experimentation. Meanwhile the wheelbarrow is a symbol of raw labor, a classic example of inertia.In the work Rinamanyanga Hariputirwe, I explore the Zimbabwean sociocultural context, whilst making a broader connection to the African context.11 The work explores events of August 2016 when Zimbabwe started experiencing mass citizen protests against an oppressive government system. We witnessed a group of people questioning definitions imposed upon them and resisting a narrow mold formerly used to characterize them. In my work these developments are explored using various objects built around the boxing bag as if to defend the bags, and the horns allude to a nascent aggression built up in a group of people.Ruth Simbao: I am currently grappling with the ideas of learning sideways and reaching sideways to develop two approaches in my own work as a scholar and a teacher: 1) South-South12 and intracontinental scholarly engagement that does not always look “upwards” to the theories, methodologies, and institutions of Europe and North America13 and 2) nonhierarchical—or at least less-hierarchical—ways of learning in educational and other contexts that emphasize reciprocal, horizontal learning (Simbao 2015b). In what ways are the concepts of learning sideways or reaching sideways articulated in the visual and performing arts, and how might they be further implemented in our various contexts of scholarship, education and art production? How could a sideways reach change the orientation of the dominant discourse of the arts of Africa that in many ways continues to emphasize an “upwards” reach?Kristin NG-Yang: My work is situated in the global South and engages with South-South collaboration. It is, in part, autobiographical in that it references my own predicament as a Chinese/African artist/mother/father. My identity is tempered, as different philosophical, cultural, and gendered dimensions both challenge and shape me. Reflecting the complexity of working in this position, I recently produced an installation titled Bird/Fish14 (Fig. 6), which draws from a Chinese song in which a bird falls in love with a fish. Alluding to the ephemeral and the impossible, dancers interact with the shadows of suspended fish/birds that are painted onto plexiglass.The installation encourages viewers to meditate on issues of time and continuity, presence and absence, as well as sameness and difference. It also alludes to ambiguity: One is confronted with choice but is also subject to fate, obliged to accept or resist, in the process of learning about self and other. Through the use of live performance and music, the installation references African, Chinese, and Western cultural idioms in a collision and fusion that is both strange and yet familiar. I commissioned musician Jianjun Wang to compose a special piece for Bird/Fish, using the traditional Chinese musical instrument the guzheng and the African djembe drum. These musical instruments from different regions combine in a way that conveys a sense of otherworldliness—a sound meditation that shifts between the realms and vibrations of both birds and fish.Patrick Mudekereza (translated by Jean-Sylvain Tshilumba Mukendi): In my context in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this logic of knowledge sharing is evident in artists’ collectives in a much more relevant way than in formal arts institutions. In particular, I have experienced this in the case of the Vicanos Club in the late 1990s and early 2000s in Lubumbashi. Reflecting on our various experiences over time, it seems evident that our challenges differ when we focus locally on Lubumbashi and when we try to have a regional or international impact. In the Vicanos Club, we didn't bother much about what was happening elsewhere and we focused very locally, renaming things in a language that fluidly mixed Swahili, French, and English. Today, the practice of Waza, Centre d'art de Lubumbashi15 (Figs. 7–8) is part of the flow of information shared worldwide. This openness should not temper our enthusiasm to name our reality in our own way. Instead of using the international art world's language, we need to choose voices that reflect what we have to say, and we can then dare to expand the references used in the field. This is a big challenge, because even when interactions are broader and more fluid, the prisms and frameworks tend to remain unchanged and the same ambitious explorers are visible and present themselves to us as intermediaries. For this reason, we choose very carefully the collaborations we get involved in.Waza has integrated two networks that are worth mentioning in relation to the concept of sideways learning—Arts Collaboratory and the Africa Cluster of Another Roadmap School.16 Arts Collaboratory is a community of artistic organizations from Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The project Arts Schoolaboratory, which forms part of this network, redefines our responsibilities and develops a framework for content and methodologies based on an alternative artistic education that focuses on “learnagogy” instead of pedagogy. The Africa Cluster of Another Roadmap is a research project that sets up relevant educational tools in our own African contexts, breaking with “missionary stances” in the teaching of art that were inherited from colonization.Aidah Nalubowa: Education has different meanings for different people. In Uganda, our education continues to conform to the legacy of colonial education and as such remains a largely Western concept. If a student simply attends an institution that has a curriculum, takes exams or tests, and receives a diploma, certificate, or degree, she or he is considered to be educated. But what about a kind of education that is different—more creative and engaging? This could be, for example, something as simple as learners and the instructor sitting in a circle facing each other or the use of creative games to generate a sense of equality and active participation rather than passive agreement and conformity. Forms of sideways learning are not common in education in Uganda.As a member of the Artivists 4 Life collective in Uganda, I seek to bring creativity to scholarship and scholarship to art. Artivists 4 Life is a community of practice in Uganda that fuses artistic processes with social activism to respond to the conditions that plague our everyday modern existence, which still reflects a colonial framework. The collective was founded by a group of young artists including photographers, graphic designers, dancers, actors, painters, cartoonists, graffiti artists, and arts lovers, who have a deep desire for social change. After a series of informal meetings and brainstorming sessions that began in a small studio at Makerere University in March 2011, the group developed the name—Artivists 4 Life (from the concept of “Art + Action”)—as well as a logo (Fig. 9), a slogan, a set of core objectives, and a manifesto.The collective uses various art forms to identify problems, find solutions, and communicate particular messages. The messages are tested in the community and later presented in the form of drama skits, dances, murals, and billboards. Members of the collective, which is a registered community-based organization in Mukono District in Uganda, are based in Kampala and Kayunga Districts, as well as in Canada.17 Made up of members of varying education levels, the group embraces the approach “each one teach one,” which links to sideways learning as everyone shares knowledge and learns from one another. Group members have no permanent roles, and duties and responsibilities are distributed according to interest, availability, skills, and need at particular times.Critical to our methodology is Freire's (2005:72) notion of moving away from the “banking system” that simply “deposits” knowledge. In Freire's understanding of pedagogy, the teacher's role ceases to be that of the knower and the giver of knowledge, and the learner participates in the process of creating, analyzing, and sharing knowledge. As such, indigenous creative methods can be used to own and repurpose knowledge, creating inclusive decolonial spaces.Genevieve Hyacinthe: I was educated as an art historian and also trained as a West African ritual dancer for sixteen years, and a colleague once told me I use dance as art historical social practice. I like this descriptor; if sideways learning is about challenging hierarchies, then we art historians might consider stepping out of our comfort zones of clean, critical distance, where our words can sometimes rain (reign) down upon the artists, artworks, and contexts that we include in the discourses that we construct.One of my recent collaborative performances, entitled The West African Dance Experience (Performance and Discussion with the Students of West African Dance: History, Theory, Practice), took place in November 2016 in the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College, State University of New York, where I taught for a number of years. Here, and in many of my courses, I endeavored to collaborate with my students by breathing life into Robert Farris Thompson's (1974) now canonical text, “African Art in Motion: Icon and Act.” In this class, after reading and discussing key scholarly ideas with my students, I moved out from behind the podium and into the studio with them to share dance choreographies from djembe styles born in Senegal, Guinea, and Mali. The students were in turn encouraged to add their own contemporary moves.As I played the drums for The West African Dance Experience performance, I saw elements of the Black Lives Matter, Rhodes Must Fall, and Fees Must Fall movements being transcribed in the bodies of the student dancers, who were still recovering their breath from the recent US election failure. In the first photographic image of this series (Fig. 10), the viewer sees the back of a black male dancer who moves his hands up into the “hands up, don't shoot” position, translating through his body a catch-phrase of our era. In that photograph, however, the male student is covered, protected. His breath won't be taken, for his sisters dance in front of him, their hands fully raised, in the spirit of black preservation as women's work. In the second image (Fig. 11), two young men are protected by the Sounou dance of femininity that I taught the students of various gender expressions, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds, who come together in collective breath; in collective protest and art-making. None are alone; all of our hands are raised. The gestures of “hands up don't shoot” become the waving hands of testament, and these hands then turn into raised fists of solidarity (Fig. 12).Ruth Simbao: In recent years, critically important movements and forms of protest and activism, including Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, Rhodes Must Fall, and Fees Must Fall have challenged oppressive regimes, ongoing racism, police brutality, outmoded institutions, and increasing income disparity. In what ways have, could, or should such pressing events shape our production of scholarly and artistic knowledge? How do these movements and protests, as well as the situations of injustice that drive them, shape our writing, teaching, creative processes, and activism? How might we choose to engage with pressing social justice concerns as scholars and artists in Africa and the African diaspora without, as Basim Magdy (2003) writes, being stereotyped and limited to our respective local sociopolitical contexts and thus consumed as artists and writers in a narrow way?18Lee-Roy Jason: In October 2016 I chose to photograph the Fees Must Fall movement during a fresh spate of protests, as students in South Africa continued to demand free and decolonized tertiary education. Through my photographic work I responded to what I saw in newspapers and on television, and what I heard about the demonstrators over the radio and online. It concerned me that the “Fallists” were simply being labeled as the problem in the mainstream media and by those in power at academic institutions and in government. Regularly they were referred to as disorganized hooligans who were simply in defiance of writing exams.I wanted to be part of those who were documenting other versions of this story.I went to Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg every day for two week",

As this is the earliest object-relation, the beginnings of which reach into the nebulous times where the frontiers of ego and external world merge into each other, it is of paramount importance both theoretically and practically. In the case of primitive object-relation an alteration in the behaviour towards the object is not necessarily the consequence of an altered emotional attitude (love, hate), but originates in the child's naive egoism. The first disturbance of the naive egoism is caused by the mother's turning away from her growing child. To sum up: the child who has outgrown his infancy is no longer so agreeable to the mother, nevertheless he clings to her and does not know any other form of love but that of his naive egoism.",

It is the process by which all the pieces of the living world find their relationships to the other pieces to form larger wholes and to enable the living world to grow, adapt, and survive. In this article I explore the matter of sharing communication in groups, which I refer to as cooperation. Cooperation is different from the process involved when two individuals exchange messages, an interaction I refer to as negotiation. When two or more people come together and interact, a third entity emerges: a relationship. One must necessarily communicate with (relate to) both another person and with the relationship. A married person relates not only to a spouse but to the higher-order entity, the relationship. In school a student relates not only to individuals but to the class as an entity with its own characteristics and demands. While we are fairly explicit about the rules (politeness, use of language) for interpersonal communication, we tend to behave as though groups are only collections of individuals and that cooperation is achieved through negotiation. We do not recognize that the higher-order group-shared communication which I call cooperation requires a different set of rules and has a different purpose or function. Rather, we invoke the processes appropriate for interpersonal communication and thus rarely become a truly cooperating, sharing group,",

It is easy to suppose that because other animals ‘lack language’ (as we put it), they must have nothing to say to us. But the impression that they lack something, a faculty that we possess, is created entirely by our anthropocentric perspective. Perhaps, if language were the only way to communicate, then lacking such language might be equated with having nothing worth communicating, though even that seems unsafe as a general inference. In practice, language may be a restriction as well as a facility, since language users, accustomed to reading or hearing...",

There are regularities characteristic of beliefs and desires, regularities that dictate both the effect of certain sort of evidence on what beliefs and desires are maintained, and the effect of certain sorts of belief–desire profiles on what responses are evinced. Those regularities will typically identify what it is to be evidentially rational in the attitudes one holds and responsively rational in the responses one makes, though they may also point us toward obstacles that get in the way of rational performance. A system will count as an intentional agent to the extent that its interactions with its environment, or at least some of its interactions, are governed by such regularities.",

They give voice to the worrying intuition that if we were less affected by sexism and racism, or better at keeping our tempers, our fellow humans would look and sound differently to us. Alien Experience argues that we should take this sense of unease seriously. It is as philosophically significant as our unease over desires or fears that we disown. Making sense of this unease requires us to re-think the relation between experiences and standing commitments; to re-consider what we mean by self-control; and to attend to empirical questions about perception, attention, and tacit cognition. Alien Experience contests the assumption that while we may be answerable (morally, ethically, legally) for our attitudes and emotions, we are not answerable, at least not in any interesting way, for our perceptions and sensations. That assumption is threaded through debates in the philosophy of mind, moral psychology, and ethics, but it leads to a flattened view of the ways experiences are related to agency. Recognizing that we in fact can be alienated from our experiences leads us to a more nuanced view of agency, and helps us appreciate distinctive opportunities for self-improvement.",

      "abstract": "Currently, we can observe a crisis of self and its respective weak ties with a group and lack of community bonds. All these make it that on the one hand there is a need for professional help, and on the other the effectiveness of such help is rated as low. The manners of empowering both he person, group and community are sought. We deal with such empowerment, among other things, at the level of self-help groups. Yet the source of that success should be sought not so much in the phenomenon of a group as in the very person and his activity. It is the person who thanks to his indispensable abilities can overcome biological and social limitations. Owing to self-help activity the person develops his abilities and frees himself from the sense of helplessness, powerlessness and hopelessness. The phenomenon of self-help activity requires that a new role and competence of the psychologist (and not only him) be defined in relation with self-help groups. On the one hand, he must be capable of arousing confidence in particular persons and groups to himself, to his own competencies, to use their own resources. On the other hand, he must be able to organize, facilitate and animate those social processes in which the division into the giving and the taking will be overcome. The reconstruction of a sense of community that is well underway in the self-help groups is an initial condition by which to join the broader trend of constructive social activities.",

The arbitrariness is unlimited; human beings can initiate and produce absurd combinations, contextual failures and deceptive expressions, and do so also by intonation and body‐language. These are the sources of social behaviour, of literature, arts, jurisprudence, politics, etc., all representing systems of meaning constructed by human beings, present in their ‘Lebenswelt’. Human beings are flexible, sensible of emotions and well‐trained to code and decode hidden fallacies, to produce wild associations, capricious‐temporary conclusions, tasks that the rigid computer cannot fulfil. They can choose incorrect and dysfunctional answers; the exactness of their reasoning can be logically invalid. The computer has only inner horizons; human beings have also outer ones, in which they are able to produce multidimensional relationships. They are not truth‐conditioned.

This also includes the usage of typical human senses like vision, hearing and tactile sensing. Second, a robot manipulating items in an unstructured environment like a person's home needs to have some haptic feedback: information whether an item is firmly grasped or sliding is important for handling objects.

      "title": "Experiencing the presence of the deceased: Symptoms, spirits, or ordinary life?",
      "abstract": "Experiences of presence are common in bereavement. The bereaved person may see the deceased, hear their familiar voice, or otherwise feel they are close at hand. But although common, they are experiences not without controversy. They have come under a variety of descriptions, from 'hallucinations', lacking in meaning and even essentially meaningless, to 'continuing relationships', of rich personal significance. The current thesis represents the first systematic investigation of the properties and meaning of experiences of presence. Narrative biographic interviews with bereaved informants were analysed using Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis. Analytical focus was on the ways in which participants made such experiences meaningful. As a novel approach, this thesis reports several new findings about these phenomena. Firstly, the experiences happened in a variety of bonds (including spouses, parents, grandparents, children, siblings and others), and in a variety of circumstances of the bereavement (including sudden and expected deaths). In all cases, they were described as richly meaningful experiences and as relying on several sources for this meaning. The personal histories of participants were of particular importance in making sense of experiences of presence. Within this context, the experience acquired sense as a continuation of some aspect of the relationship with the deceased. The experiences also had diverse functions, from soothing to destructive. Sometimes, the experiences helped the bereaved to resolve unfinished business with the deceased; at other times, the help was with a much more ordinary problem. On some occasions the experiences of presence caused the bereaved more problems; they simply pronounced the grief or continued a fraught relationship. Participants showed that they had many cultural resources available to them in making sense of their experiences but they did not use all of them. Many informants used some spiritual and psychological ideas to make sense of their experiences. The thesis concludes that many of the most popular theories for these experiences impoverish them by stripping them of their diversity and important aspects of their meaning. The thesis also makes recommendations for psychotherapy for those who have problems of living as a result of their experiences of presence. The study also has implications for psychological research as none of these findings could have been observed through the use of an experimental methodology.",

      "title": "Urcuioli's differential‐outcomes research: Implications for our behavioral units",
      "abstract": "Abstract Our behavioral units include stimulus classes and response classes. Peter Urcuioli's differential‐outcomes research implies they should extend to the third term of the three‐term contingency. Classes of consequences come in several varieties (e.g., conditional reinforcers, tokens), but our vocabulary does not coherently organize them. They are differentiated not only by physical properties such as type, location, and duration but also by the schedule contingencies in which they participate. We consider units ranging from the physical and chemical sciences to those based on the particular history of life on earth. The latter include biology, sociology, linguistics, and our own behavior analysis. Scientific units are typically nested (e.g., atoms within molecules, cells within organs, organisms within species). Comparing our units with those from other taxonomies raises questions about their emergence and evolution and their shared properties across levels of nesting (e.g., species within genus, subclasses within higher order operants, phonemes within words). Emergence necessarily occurs when higher order units have functions that are not shared with their lower order constituents. These nested and multileveled behavior classes challenge single‐level views, such as metaphorical accounts of behavior as a totality contained within a pie, with slices corresponding to behavior classes matched to their outcomes.",

      "title": "The Learning Process in Infancy",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter presents a theoretical approach to perceptual learning as it functions in development. The first question for any learning theory is what is learned. For what phenomena, cognitive accomplishments, or behavioral changes does this theory offer an explanation? One general, fairly abstract answer for perceptual learning is that infants learn to perceive affordances: that is, to perceive what the events, objects, and layout of the environment offer that relates to and may be controlled by the infant, a relation that can be referred to as an organism environment fit. Learning about affordances is learning meanings for what can be perceived. Perceptual learning is also the way developing organisms discover invariants of events, things, and the layout of the world. Invariants characterize the total event. In reaching out for an object, the arm moves away from the body, ap proaching closer and closer to the object, closing in as it begins to make contact. Momentary segments of this event, like still shots from a film, do not characterize the event at all and could vary in a number of ways without changing what is invariant about the event. The event can be characterized as a whole and is meaningful to infants long before they can describe it linguistically.",

      "abstract": "Language is a universal means of expression. With language we can\ncommunicate our experience, our thoughts, and even our aspirations to others.\nLanguage, however, is not only for communication. Words allow us to classify\nobjects in the world. By the use of language we make sense of our experiences\nin a very structured and elaborate way. We can ‘class’ objects together and we\ncan make subtle distinctions between them. We can predict certain qualities that\nmay be found in an object by comparing our own experience with the internal\nlist of objects that fits the same class as the object being observed. For example,\na child’s first confrontation with a puppy may result in a variety of experiences.\nIf the puppy is friendly and quiet and allows the child to play or cuddle it, the\nchild’s first experience will, in the main, be a pleasurable one. If, on the other\nhand, the puppy barks or growls or even bites the child, the outcome will be\nquite different. Whatever the outcome the child will probably add to his or her\ngrowing vocabulary either the word ‘dog’ or ‘puppy’ (or perhaps ‘Rover’,\n‘Shep’, ‘Snapper’ etc.). On the second occasion that this child comes into\ncontact with a dog, the child will most probably remember the first experience.\nIt is likely that the child will utter the appropriate label, ‘dog’ or ‘Rover’\nalthough the experience may well be of a different dog altogether. What is\nimportant is that the child has started to classify his or her experience and by so\ndoing can start to predict the potential outcome of the encounter and to act\naccordingly, either by attempting to play or by moving away in fright. The word\n‘dog’ helps to classify differences; for example, ‘cats’ are often like puppies in\nappearance but do not fit the same class.",

      "title": "Four Experiments in the Sociology of Aesthetics",
      "abstract": "The author reports on four experiments he conducted to obtain perceivers’ reactions to selected objects not made as art objects that because of the method and/or location of their display would lead one to expect them to be art objects. He found that perceivers trained in an older, ‘romantic’, more affective orientation were the most disturbed when they felt that the sacred space of a museum or gallery was violated. Those accustomed to perceiving events in galleries as a species of intellectual game were not disturbed—they accepted the notion that innovations in aesthetic experience might be performed at any point in the experience: in the objects, in the physical setting, in the definition of roles, in the relations between originator and recipient, anywhere.\n\t His experiments lead him to conclude that the art world (in its broadest aspects in, for example, Canada) is the prime institutional realm in which innovators can experiment with symbols of thinking and feeling and action as much as they like, and with the least risk of life, sustenance or anything else the society usually regards as serious and important.\n\t L’auteur rend compte de quatre experiences auxquelles il a procede dans le but de determiner les reactions d’un spectateur devant un certain choix d’objets qui n’etaient pas faits expressement comme des objets d’art, mais qui en raison de leur emplacement et de la maniere dont ils etaient presentes, ameneraient le spectateur a croire qu’il s’agissait d’objets d’art. Il constata que les sujets eleves dans une optique plus traditionnelle, ‘romantique’, affective, etaient les plus troubles quand l’espace sacre d’un musee ou d’une galerie etait viole. Ceux qui etaient habitues a considerer ce qui se passe dans les galeries d’art comme une sorte de jeu intellectuel n’etaient pas troubles. Ils acceptaient le fait que des innovations esthetiques puissent etre faites dans n’importe quel domaine de l’experience: dans les objets, dans l’environnement, dans la definition des roles, dans les relations entre le createur et le spectateur, n’importe ou.\n\t Ses experiences l’amenent a la conclusion que le monde des arts (dans ses aspects les plus larges, au Canada par exemple) est le premier royaume institutionnel dans lequel les innovateurs peuvent experimenter autant qu’ils veulent a l’aide de symboles de pensee, de sentiments et d’action, et sans mettre en danger la vie, ni la subsistance, ni tout ce que la societe considere habituellement comme etant serieux et d’importance.",

      "title": "Some mechanisms which distinguish the crowd from other forms of social behavior.",
      "abstract": "Social psychology may profitably adapt to its own uses the knowledge of abnormal behavior possessed by the psychopathologist. There is much group behavior which shows a lack of adjustment to social situations very similar to that of certain neuroses. Without entering upon the discussion of the question of the therapeutic value of the Freudian method of psychoanalysis, it is safe to say that we are greatly indebted to Freud for such knowledge as we possess concerning the determinants of many well recognized types of individual maladjustment to environment. The same unconscious mechanisms which cause the unadjusted individual to be out of harmony with his fellows may on occasion lead a group of men to forms of behavior which are in the true sense anti-social. The term is somewhat ambiguous. In one sense any reaction to the human beings in one's environment is social behavior, and anti-social behavior is that in which human fellowship plays no part, being present neither in the stimulus nor as a factor which modifies the mode of response. If we exclude certain very simple reflexes, it is doubtful if there is antisocial behavior in this sense. Psychopathology finds in such behavior a criterion by which the normal may be distinguished from the abnormal. Now unless we are content to regard any sort of social relationship as a norm, it would seem that we are justified in applying to groups of men the same criteria that are used to determine whether an individual is adjusted or unadjusted. Strikes are condemned because the behavior of those who participate in them frequently shows no concern for the public. Evolutionary groups are said to be intoxicated. Men with common sense have long regarded such phenomena as these as epidemic mental affections. Thus, I think, we may fairly say that there is a generally recognized distinction between that social behavior which results in satisfactory adjustment and that which fails in this respect. Not every group is a crowd, in the psychological sense of the term. When a group becomes a crowd, according to Le Bon, there is a stripping off of the layer of conscious personality along with all higher mental faculties. Hence the individual in the crowd descends several rungs in the ladder of civilization. Le Bon, fanciful as his explanation may have been, was on the right track. He saw that the behavior of crowds is a special phenomenon of social psychology; that the thought and behavior of people in a crowd is different from that which we find in their ordinary social relationships. On this point Le Bon's thinking was essentially empirical. The facts of behavior justify such a distinction and without it, it is difficult to see how a social psychology can be very significant. I give as an illustration an episode in the political history of New York City. There are three characteristics of the crowd mind, which so far as I can discover, are uniformly present. The three characteristics of crowd behavior which are so symptomatic that they may be used empirically to distinguish the crowd from normal forms of social behavior.

(section 9.1); in what sense do the partners in such a relationship seek to be united with each other? (section 9.2); in what sense does such a relationship involve suffering for the partners? (section 9.3); in what sense do the partners in such a relationship have need of each other and of their relationship and therefore experience desire or eros? (section 9.4); in what sense is the attitude of the partners toward each other one of unconditional giving or agape? (section 9.5). In discussing these aspects of love, we will distinguish between the roles which they have within the following ‘dimensions of love’: romantic love, neighbourly love, our love for God, and God's love for us. In all this we must remember that God is not like other people. What then are the limits of using the model of love in talking about our relationship to God, and what is the conceptual price we have to pay for doing so?",

      "title": "The representation of self through the dialogic properties of talk and conduct",
      "abstract": "It is a basic dialogical principle that the meaning of what is said or done is based on its similarities and especially its differences with other things that might have been said or done as relevantly instead, just then, just there. This makes what was actually said or done meaningful as a “choice” for all practical purposes, whether the actor made it consciously or not. And any choice a person makes (or is deemed to make) is revealing about what he or she had in mind — his or her intentions and wants, values and affects, character and qualities as a social being — that subjectively warranted producing what was said or done instead of one of the alternatives. What one’s talk and conduct reveal about what one had in mind constitutes a representation of one’s self as a social being. This representation is a persona, a “face” in Goffman’s sense. This representation is discursively, dialogically produced, such that actors’ talk and conduct will unavoidably produce a representation of themselves regardless of whether they intend it. Accordingly, persons who would not be expected to have such competence nonetheless produce representations of self, for example young children or impaired adults. Insofar as those representations are in the person’s self-interest, there is a warrant for considering that they have that competence after all. In contrast, persons who can be expected to have such competence may nonetheless produce representations that work against their self-interest by accident or deficiencies of performance. Arguably, it is an additional dimension of the representation of self that an actor produces, having to do with his or her competence, whether the representation seems to be intentional, and beyond that, artful or clever. I examine two cases to elaborate on the key propositions here: (a) that representations of self are produced whether intended or not, (b) that ones that seem to be intended because they are in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of his or her competence, and (c) that ones that seem unintentional because they are not in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of a performance lapse, or more broadly, deficiencies of competence. The first case is of two young children whose talk and conduct interactively produce representations of self that do serve their respective interests, and thus warrant reconsideration of the expressive and interactional competence of children of that age. The second is of a doctor in an urban clinic whose representation of self is not in his self-interest.",

      "abstract": "If an agent is to be moved to action, then two requirements have to be fulfilled: first, the agent must possess beliefs about the way things actually are, about the actions possible given the way things are, and about the likely effects of those actions on how things are; and, second, the agent must have or form desires to change the way things are by resorting to this or that course of action. The beliefs tell the agent about how things are and about how they can be altered; the desires attract the agent to how things are not but can be made to be. This rough sketch of beliefs and desires is widely endorsed in contemporary philosophy; it derives in many ways from the seminal work of the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher David Hume. The striking thing about it, from the point of view of desire, is that it characterizes desire by the job desire does in collaborating with belief and thereby generating action: it characterizes desire by function, not by the presence of any particular feeling. The account raises a host of questions. Is desire an entirely different sort of state from belief, for example, and from belief-related states like habits of inference? Does desire have to answer to the considerations of evidence and truth that are relevant to belief and inference? How does desire relate to preference and choice? And how does desire relate to the values that we ascribe to different courses of action and that influence us in what we do?",

Existential humility includes holding cherished beliefs regarding the meaning of life and death loosely enough to revise in light of evidence, as well as lower defensiveness following existential threats or reminders. We discuss the broader personality structure IH and EH, focusing on the Big Five factor of agreeableness as well as narcissism. We propose that the most diagnostic situations of the existence of intellectual humility – heretofore rare in the empirical literature – are in the realm of existential beliefs. Moving from existential arrogance to humility may require substantial self-change, though transcendent situations such as flow experiences, awe (e.g., wondrous vistas in nature), meditation, or even experience with psychedelics may be viable pathways toward greater existential humility.",

      "abstract": "Conscious experience can be treated as a complex unified whole, but to do so is problematic from an evolutionary perspective if, like other products of evolution, consciousness had simple beginnings, and achieved complexity only secondarily over an extended period of time as new categories of subjective experience were added and refined. The premise here is twofold, first that these simple beginnings can be investigated regardless of whether the ultimate source of subjective experience is known or understood, and second, that of the contents known to us, the most accessible for investigation will be those that are, or appear, most fundamental, in the sense that they resist further deconstruction or analysis. This would include qualia as they are usually defined, but excludes more complex experiences (here, formats) that are structured, or depend on algorithmic processes and/or memory. Vision and language for example, would by this definition be formats. More formally, qualia, but not formats, can be represented as points, lines, or curves on a topological experience space, and as domains in a configuration space representing a subset of neural correlates of consciousness, the selector circuits (SCs), responsible for ensuring that a particular experience is evoked rather than some other. It is a matter of conjecture how points in SC-space map to experience space, but both will exhibit divergence, insuring that a minimal distance separates points in experience space representing different qualia and the SCs that evoke them. An analysis of how SCs evolve over time is used to highlight the importance of understanding patterns of descent among putative qualia, i.e., their homology across species, and whether this implies descent from an ancestral experience, or ur-quale, that combines modes of experience that later came to be experienced separately. The analysis also provides insight into the function of consciousness as viewed from an evolutionary perspective, defined here in terms of the access it allows to regions of SC-space that would otherwise be unavailable to real brains, to produce consciously controlled behaviors that could otherwise not occur.",

      "abstract": "There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip, Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive of her body. From William Shakespeare, in Troilus and Cressida, Act IV, Scene V1 This issue of Topics in Language Disorders describes A Developmental Framework for Evidence-Based Practices for the Autism Spectrum. Planned by issue editors, Emily Rubin and Moira Lewis, it leads readers to look deeper into how people communicate about their thoughts and feelings using their bodies and, especially, their eyes. It is also about how to foster communication abilities in people with autism and other developmental disabilities and in their communication partners when such abilities do not develop naturally. As perhaps the keenest observer of human interaction ever, Shakespeare captured the essence of communicating via eyes and body language, even the foot, in the passage quoted at the beginning of this article. Learning to make social connections through one's eyes and other motions comes early and naturally to most infants and toddlers, but not all. A central identifying feature of autism is difficulty in social communication, and one of its earliest signs is diminished quality and quantity of eye contact. But can sensitivity to the movements and thoughts of others be taught when it does not develop naturally? Does simply saying, “Look at me,” and rewarding a response with a bit of food make a social connection happen, or does it just give the appearance that it has? Are there better ways to foster the development of shared attention and thinking? What about people with developmental difficulties who communicate unconventionally? Can adults seeking to understand those children's desires learn to do so when words are rare and body language is unconventional? And what about later in development when writers have to learn to imagine what their eventual readers might need to know and how to organize a particular type of discourse? Can students with autism learn to regulate their thoughts and discourse choices in writing as other students do? Similar questions arise about complex social situations that occur later in childhood and adolescence. Can children and adolescents with autism improve their ability to understand social thinking of others and to think socially themselves so that they can plan to act in ways that are expected and socially acceptable? The articles in this issue provide a framework, information, and evidence regarding interventions and measurement techniques related to these questions. The answers, although not simple, are mostly positive. Yes, changes can be made. The issue begins with an article by Rollins (2016), who uses a theoretical framework to explain how children on the autism spectrum can learn words and phrases and use them for instrumental purposes (to request and protest), yet continue to struggle to develop true social language. Rollins posits that this may be because of early difficulty experiencing shared emotion so that children learn to share attention to objects for purposes of requesting or turn-taking but without the element of shared emotion for social enjoyment. She argues that stepping back and helping children experience shared emotions in dyadic face-to-face interactions may be a necessary precursor to later phases of shared attention and intention for social purposes and not just instrumental ones. As evidence, Rollins presents a case study with a toddler with autism, contrasting data from a socially grounded approach with data from a more purely linguistic approach that was used previously. This involved the clinician's positioning herself face-to-face with the child (on the child's level or below) while engaging in social sensory routines using animation and contingent imitation upon establishing eye contact. It involves intersubjective looking until the child looks reciprocally, at which point the child's looking is immediately reinforced with animation and imitative interaction. But this interaction is conducted without verbal or physical prompts and with minimal use of toys. Rollins provides single-subject data to document changes in the child's social communication actions when the social approach is introduced following the baseline gathered during the linguistic approach in which interactions were encouraged around objects. In the second article, Greathead et al. (2016) in the United Kingdom take a different approach by looking closely at adults on the other side of the social communication equation. That is, they address the philosophical importance and practical skills that caregivers and teachers apply to read the body language and other nonverbal signals of children with severe or profound learning difficulties and complex communication needs. The primary focus of this second article is on observation tools and methods for documenting how people make sense of unconventional communicative actions and provide contingent feedback. An additional message that shines through the case studies is the importance and respect entailed in seeking to understand these children's and adolescents' views (not just their wants and needs in the more basic sense), even when they initiate infrequently and communicate in unconventional nonverbal ways. These authors show that, in the context of such interactions, adults can pursue the goal to support children's communication and allow them to make their views known and heard. In the third article, Rice, Adamson, Winner, and McGee (2016) add contrastive evidence about developmental differences in relating to adults and peers from a cross-sectional study at three preschool ages (2, 3, and 4 years), comparing young children with autism with children developing typically at the same ages. I recommend reading the Rollins (2016) and Rice et al. (2016) articles back-to-back. A particularly striking consistency is that the young children with autism are more likely to engage in a joint state for instrumental purposes than for purely social ones and with adults than with peers. The work by Rice and colleagues argues for applying some of Rollins' recommendations for encouraging social engagement to promote learning how to enjoy sharing attention socially and the need for more research on how to do this with peers as well as with adults. Asaro-Saddler (2016) addresses a different part of the population by systematically reviewing studies that applied self-regulated strategy development interventions to help school-age students with high functioning autism improve their writing skills. Collectively, the results of the identified studies show that such interventions can result in improved quality and quantity of writing, as well as use of more persuasive and narrative discourse elements. Improved self-regulatory abilities, such as self-monitoring and planning, also may be an outcome of teaching such self-regulatory routines in the context of written expression. In this realm too, I wondered about increasing the access to audience response so that the communicative effects of improved writing could be used to motivate additional sense of writing as a social activity. Finally, Crooke, Winner, and Olswang (2016) describe how to apply cognitive behavioral therapy to teach social thinking with older children and adolescents with social communication difficulties, including autism. An essential component of this new way of thinking is to develop the underlying knowledge to interpret others' social intentions and social situational expectations so that participants can make social behavioral adaptations and engage in constructive social problem solving. As I see it, the key is to target more than behavior change, but to develop the cognitive and thinking skills about what others might be thinking, as well as the motivations that will lead to behavior change and satisfying social interactions. What I particularly value in this article is its promotion of concrete supports and ways of talking to adolescents on the autism spectrum about abstract social concepts that allow them to “see” socially in circumstances where social signals may have been invisible to them before. A central theme of these articles is the need to go beneath words to encourage the development of emotional connections between people—to become keen observers of others and to imagine and share what others might be thinking. This involves appreciating aspects of social communication development that may be overlooked as part of development, perhaps because they are taken for granted when they emerge naturally. I predict that readers will agree that issue editors Rubin and Lewis have been successful in their purpose to raise awareness of how shared attention and social thinking develop and how to promote them when help is needed. —Nickola Wolf Nelson, PhD Editor-in-Chief",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter analyzes pity, love, sympathy, and other traits associated with compassion as they appear in the works of Scheler, Aristotle, Aquinas and Augustine, Hume, Rousseau, and Nietzsche. It also takes up analyses of compassion offered by several contemporary philosophers, including Robert Solomon and Martha Nussbaum. It identifies the following eight conditions that a robust account of compassion must meet in order to avoid problems that have plagued earlier accounts of pity, sympathy, love, and so on: (1) it must be an ethically primary trait; (2) it must recognize the role of affective as well as cognitive activity in moral decision making; (3) it must be capable of generating personally directed imperatives; (4) it must recognize from its very roots the irreducible relationality of human existence; (5) it must be as concerned with the promotion of satisfaction as it is concerned with the alleviation of suffering; (6) it must not degrade its object; (7) it must not be essentially comparative or competitive in nature; and (8) it must not be so narrow in scope that it fails to encompass all those worthy of moral consideration.",

      "title": "The Correspondence Problem in Social Learning:--What Does it Mean for Behaviors to Match Anyway",
      "abstract": "The identification of any form of social learning, imitation, copying or mimicry presupposes a notion of correspondence between two autonomous agents. Judging whether a behavior has been transmitted socially requires the observer to identify a mapping between the demonstrator and the imitator. If the demonstrator and imitator have similar bodies, e.g. are animals of the same species, of similar age, and of the same gender, then to a human observer an obvious correspondence is to map the corresponding body parts: left arm of demonstrator maps to left arm of imitator, right eye of demonstrator maps to right eye of imitator, tail of demonstrator maps to tail of imitator. There is also an obvious correspondence of actions: raising the left arm by the model corresponds to raising the left arm by the imitator, production of vocal signals by the model corresponds to the production of acoustically similar ones by the imitator, picking up a fruit by the demonstrator corresponds to picking up a fruit of the same type by the imitator. Furthermore, there is a correspondence in sensory experience: audible sounds, a touch, visible objects and colors, and so on evidently seem to be detected and experienced in similar ways. What to take as the correspondence seems relatively clear in this case. As humans, we are good at imitating and at recognizing such correspondences. It is also clear that most other animals, robots, and software programs may in fact generally fail to recognize any such correspondences. To judge a produced behavior to be a copy of an observed one, we require at least that it respects some such correspondence. The faithfulness or precision of the behavioral match can obviously vary, and no absolute cutoff or threshold exists defining success as opposed to failure of behavioral matching. But one can study the degree of success using various metrics and measures of correspondence (Nehaniv & Dautenhahn, 2001; also see below). Moreover, it turns out that the “obvious” correspondences between similar bodies mentioned above are not the only ones possible. Consider a human imitating another one that is facing her: if the demonstrator raises her left arm, should the imitator raise her own left arm? Or should she raise her right, to make a mirror image of the demonstrator's actions? If the demonstrator picks up a brush, should an imitator pick up the same brush? Or just another brush of the same type? If the demonstrator opens a container to get at chocolate inside, should the imitator open a similar container in the same way – e.g. by unwrapping but not tearing the surrounding paper?, or is it enough just to open the container somehow? The different possible answers to these questions presuppose different correspondences. If a child watches a teacher solving subtraction problems in arithmetic, and then solves for the first time similar but not identical problems on its own, social learning has occurred. But what type of correspondence is at work here? In China and Japan, the ideographic character for “to imitate” also means “to learn” or “to study”. By going through the motions of an algorithm for solving sample problems, students everywhere are able to learn how to solve similar ones, of course without necessarily gaining understanding of why the procedures they have learned work. In this article, for lack of a better term, we shall use the word “imitator” to refer to any autonomous agent performing a candidate behavioral match. The use of this word here does not entail any particular mechanism of matching or any particular type of social learning. In what follows, we shall describe how different matching phenomena arise depending on the criteria employed in generating the behavior of the imitator. For example, goal emulation, stimulus enhancement, mimicry, and so on, will all be cast as solutions to correspondence problems with different particular selection criteria.",

      "title": "The Chinese Hedgehog and the American Fox: An Invitation to Dialogue",
      "abstract": "...the words can be made to yield a sense in which they mark one of the deepest differences which divide writers and thinkers, and, it may be, human beings in general. For there exists a great chasm between those, on one side, who relate everything to a single central vision, one system, less or more coherent, or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel—a single, universal, organising principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance—and, on the other side, those who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way, for some psychological or physiological cause, related by no moral or aesthetic principle. These last lead lives, perform acts and entertain ideas that are centrifugal rather than centripetal; their thought is scattered or diffused, moving on many levels, seizing upon the essence of a vast variety of experiences and object for what they are in themselves, without, consciously or unconsciously, seeking to fit them into, or exclude them from, any one unchanging, all-embracing, sometimes self-contradictory and incomplete, at times fanatical, unitary inner vision. The first kind of intellectual and artistic personality belongs to the hedgehogs, the second to the foxes...we may, without too much fear of contradiction, say that, in this sense, Dante belongs to the first category, Shakespeare to the second; Plato, Lucretius, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Ibsen, Proust, are, in varying degrees hedgehogs; Herodotus, Aristotle, Montaigne, Erasmus, Moliere, Goethe, Pushkin, Balzac, Joyce are foxes.1",

If the world is Discourse, if the language makes the community, it seems to me that the silence is an embarrassing object into the ambit of communication. We can found eloquent traces in the passage in which Habermas interprets philosophical ideas that were strongly interested in the figure of dominator individual. In this case, is it true that the role of silence results marginal or even insignificant? Is it correct to say that the silence sets itself within the dialogue, in the same manner of death of language against its life? And is it true that the silence exclusively belongs to the Ego because it is not shared and, on the contrary, is empty, non-sense, self-centred act of exclusion? We would have to understand: or silence doesn’t take part in the discourse, (and we go back to the ancient metaphysical contradiction absence/presence, silence/word); or silence takes part in the discourse, and it brings inside various kinds of indications, according to the contexts. In this manner we could give a correct interpretation of assent, dissent, acceptance, suspension, introduction for listening.",

      "abstract": "From Human to Agent Societies There is no (apparent) need to advocate any anthropomorphic principle to reason about agents. Analogy is enough to drive comparisons and possibly help us foreseeing the evolution of agent systems. More than ten thousands years have seen humans evolve as situated, speaking, specialisable, and context-aware entities, co-existing and interacting within societies, deeply immersed within environments. Latest results from historical sciences [1] tell us that, after millions years of biological evolution, cultural and social evolution have become predominant – where social evolution basically means organisational changes in the social structure. Also, the role of the environment is reckoned, as a dynamic and active force that drives the evolution of human societies, and also affects the ability of both individuals and social structures to survive, grow, and possibly overcome the others. In turn, the evolution of the environment is partially under human’s control. So, depending on their understanding of the environment and of its dynamics, individuals and societies might plan and act so as to affect environment’s changes over time, and survive and grow according to their ability in modelling and building / modifying their own environment.",

      "abstract": "The societal concern for animal welfare stems from the acknowledgement that they are sentient beings, whether their sentience makes morally unacceptable any act that would increase their suffering (utilitarian point of view) or animals deserve rights because of their sentience (animal rights point of view). Several definitions of animal welfare have been proposed, based on common sense, mechanisms, or operational indicators. These definitions should not be interpreted as uncertainties about the existence of the concept but rather as different aspects of the same concept. Whatever the definition used, research on animal welfare attempts to answer the following questions: To what extent are the animals used by humans capable of emotions? How does an animal perceive its environment? How can we assess the level of animal welfare in a given situation? What are the impacts of the ways we treat animals on their welfare? To answer these questions, animal welfare scientists borrow methodologies and theoretical frameworks from various disciplines, mainly behavioural sciences, including not only ethology but also experimental psychology, animal cognition, or stress physiology. The focus is not on the description of animal behaviour or stress responses but rather on the understanding of how animals experience their world. Hence the recent developments issued from psychology, studying cognitive bias or relations between cognition and emotions. Animal welfare science can be considered as a new behavioural science, applied to societal concerns about our relations to animals, with specific research questions and methodologies inspired by other disciplines.",

      "title": "The Physical Modelling of Human Social Systems",
      "abstract": "One of the core assumptions in the study of complex systems is that there exist ‘universal’ features analogous to those that characterize the notion of universality in statistical physics. That is to say, sometimes the details do not matter: certain aspects of complex behaviour transcend the particularities of a given system, and are to be anticipated in any system of a multitude of simultaneously interacting components. There can be no tougher test of this idea than that posed by the nature of human social systems. Can there really be any similarities between, say, a collection of inanimate particles in a fluid interacting via simple, mathematically defined forces of attraction and repulsion, and communities of people each of whom is governed by an unfathomable wealth of psychological complexity? The traditional approach to the social sciences has tended to view these psychological factors as irreducible components of human social interactions. But attempts to model society using the methods and tools of statistical physics have now provided ample reason to suppose that, in many situations, the behaviour of large groups of people can be understood on the basis of very simple interaction rules, so that individuals act essentially as automata responding to a few key stimuli in their environment. This is clearly a challenging, perhaps even disturbing, idea. I will review some of the evidence in its favour. I will show, with examples ranging from pedestrian dynamics to social choice theory, economics, demography, and the formation of businesses and alliances, that modelling the behaviour of individuals and social and political institutions according to the viewpoint of statistical physics does seem capable of capturing some of the important features of social systems. These models reveal many of the characteristic elements displayed by other complex systems: collective dynamics that changes via abrupt shifts (phase transitions), metastability, critical phenomena and scale-free statistical variations. I will discuss what this implies for the notions of human free will and determinism.",

      "title": "Fundamental Steps in the Development of Adaptive Behavior of the Eyes",
      "abstract": "Summary 1. Records of human eye-movements involved in following a simple object of regard during its harmonic oscillation, in the foveal fixation of a motionless object, and in the fixation movements to new objects of regard, show characteristics which lead us to the following generalizations and hypotheses:2. Approximation and correction is a type of adjustment that appears in simple forms of human behavior as well as in the conduct of affairs and the development of science. While the first responses to a new situation often follow the principle of trial and selection, subsequent adjustment in the selected mode of response commonly follows other formulae, frequently that of approximation and correction. The latter seems to be a complement of the former principle. We conjecture that it ranks close to trial and error as a general formula of adjustment.3. The tendency of an adjustment pattern to break down at or near its physiological limit and to give place to a simpler form of reaction appears in response to relatively simple stimuli as well as in response to the complex stimuli of our social and economic environment. We conjecture that it represents some fundamental characteristic of neural action that may be found in a great variety of human and infra-human behavior. It is probably related to relative fatigue and to the rivalry and competition for control of common paths.4. Anticipatory reaction is found in a simple form of human adaptive behavior as well as that which depends on insight and purpose. We conjecture that it is one of the fundamental forms of learning to meet familiar situations. Whether it develops on the basis of antecedent cues which are so related to the adequate stimuli that they become secondary or conditioned stimuli, or on the basis of the constellation of stimuli in configurations, is a question that our data did not answer. Résumé Les rasultats des études des mouvements des yeux chez les êtres humains quand ils suivent du regard un simple objet pendant son oscillation harmonique, dans la fixation fovéale d'un objet immobile, et dans les mouvements de fixation aux nouveaux objets du regard, montrent des caractéristiques qui nous font formuler les généralisations et les hypothèes suivantes: L'approximation et la correction sont un type d'ajustement lquel se trouve dans les simples formes du comportemept humain ainsi que dans la conduite des affaires et le développement de la science. Tandis que les premières réponses à une situation nouvelle suivent souvent le principe essai et choix, l'ajustement subséquent dans la mode choisie de réponse suit ordinairement d'autres formules, fréquemment celle d'approximation et de correction. Celle-ci semble être un complément du premier principe. On conjecture que celui-ci a à peu près la valeur du principe essai et erreur comme formule générale d'ajustement. La tendance d'une. mode d'ajustement à disparaître à ou près de sa limite physiologique et à donner lieu à une plus simple forme de réactioa se montre en réponse aux stimuli relativement simples ainsi qu'en réponse aux stimuli complexes de notre milieu social et économique. On conjecture qu'elle représente quelque trait fondamental de l'action des nerfs lequel peut se trouver dans une grande variété du comportement humain et infra-humain. Elle aura des rapports avec la fatigue relative et la rivalité et la concurrence pour le contrôle des sentiers communs. La réaction anticipée se trouve dans une simple forme du comportement d'adaptation des humains ainsi que dans celle qui dépend de connaissance et de but. On conjecture que c'est une des formes fondamentales de I'effort d'apprendre à faire face à des situations bien connues. Nos données ne nous disent pas définitivement si elle se dèveloppe sur la base de suggestions antérieures lesquelles ont tel rapport avec les stimuli adéquats qu'elles deviennent des stimuli secondaires ou conditionnels ou sur la base de la position des stimuli dans les configurations. Referat Aufzeichnungen von Bewegungen menschlicher Augen, während ihrer harmonischen Schwingungen beim Verfolgen eines einfachen Sehobjektes, bei fovealer Fixierung eines unbeweglichen Objektes, und bei Fixierungbewegungen auf neue Sehobjekte, weisen Merkmale auf, die uns zu den folgenden Verallgemeinerungen und Hypothesen führen: Annäherung (approximation) und Korrektur ist ein Anpassungstypus, welcher sowohl in einfachen Formen des menschlichen Verhaltens als auch in der Durchführung von Geschäften und in der Entwicklung der Wissenschaften wiederkehrt. Währenddem die ersten Reaktionen hinsichtlich einer Situation oft dem Prinzip von Versuch und Auswahl. folgen nachträgliche Anpassungen im gewählten Modus der Reaktion gewöhnlich andern Formeln, oft der der Annäherung und Korrektur. Das letztere Prinzip scheint eine Ergänzung des obigen zu sein. Wir vermuten, dass es dem Probieren als allgemeine Formel der Anpassung nahesteht. Die Tendenz eines Anpassungsmusters, an oder nahe einer Physiologischen Grenze zu zerfliessen, um einer einfacheren Form der Reaktion Platz zu machen, zeigt sich sowohl bei der Rückwirkung auf verhältnismässig einfache Reize. wie auch bei der Rückwirkung auf die komplexen Reize unserer gesellschaftlichen und ökonomischen Umgebung. Wir vermuten, dass dies ein wesentliches Merkmal der Nerventätigkeit ist, das wohl in manigfachen Variationen des menschlichen und inframenschlichen Verhaltens wiederzufinden ist. Es ist wahrscheinlich verwandt mit der relativen Müdigkeit und dem Wetteifer und—Kampf für die Beherrschung allgemeiner Mittel. Zuvorkommende Reaktionen kann man bei einfachen Formen des menschlichen Anpassungsvermögens beobachten, als auch bei solchen, die auf Einsicht und Ziel beruhen. Wir vermuten, dass sie eine der wesentlichen Formen des Lernens sind, um bekannten Situationen zu begegnen. Ob sie sich auf Grund vorhergehender Winke entwickeln, die sich zu den ihnen entsprechenden so verhalten, dass sie sekundäre oder bedingte Reize werden, oder auf Grund einer Reizkonstellation in Gebilden, ist eine Frage, die unsere Aufzeichnungen nicht bestimmt beantworten.",

Characters in this play secretly represent themselves, in some way or other, as beings of some sort according to their own desire and conception of their relations with others in their society while doing everyday things such as greeting, masquerading, wit-cracking, etc. In some cases their representations face objections whether directly or indirectly, but in most cases they are accepted for sake of peaceable relationships and form reality of their actual relationships. In fact, actualities of human relationships in this play look real only when they are represented; subjects of representation seem to occupy a realm broadly conceptual in nature, while represented ones are felt to be so real that every character is quick to respond to them. The human relationship in this play becomes more alive and real by being represented, whether by courteous conversations or play-acts for gulls to eavesdrop. That representations look more real awakens us to fact that world as we know it is never real but a constructed one. There is no knowing real world without mediacy of language; things as we know them are not things themselves but concepts of them. Seen in this way, play is a version of world outside which becomes more alive and real by being represented. This is perhaps what Shakespeare meant by saying, the whole world is a stage and what monstrous nothing in title of play really means. The play is a world which is, though represented, not a mere fiction because world itself is not in a position to be asserted to be more real than represented one.",

Reports of someone's beliefs seem to be of this kind, as do reports of his likes and dislikes.

They originate in the relational learning processes in which the individual participates, and they presuppose the ability to thematize oneself in relation to others, especially by means of language. Among the basic constituents of all these features is the insight into one's own limitations: to be wise and humble presupposes that one knows what one cannot do or be, whereas grace is the manifestation of that which moves oneself beyond what one thought it was possible to do or be, due to unforeseen and unanticipated elements in the reality in which one takes part. Hence, wisdom, humility, and grace must all be seen as conditions for (pre-)human agency, building on psychological and other evolved capacities. Thus, these features are also important elements when humans relate to the world in terms of orientation, transformation, and reflection.",

      "title": "General Well-Being of Students and Professionals in the Field of Performing Arts in Relation to Gender and Experience",
      "abstract": "Well-being is the state of being happy, healthy and prosperous. Well-being or welfare is a general term for the condition of an individual or group, for example their social, economic. Psychological, spiritual or medical state: high well being means that, in some sense, the individual’s or group’s experience is positive while low well- being is associated with negative happenings. Well-being is equated with the experience of pleasure and the absence of pain over time. The less psychological pain an individual is experiencing the more he or she is going to expenence well-being. When someone is experiencing positive well-being they are also experiencing a few other things. It involves a sense of self-fulfilment, which is the feeling of being happy and one is doing something that fully uses your abilities and talents. The feeling of having a purpose in life and connection with others are also contributors to the idea of well-being when people feel as though they have a purpose in the world they feel like they belong. They feel like they matter and it goes back to be idea that we were created for and by a purpose. Mental Health Week in 2015 has drawn attention to a new evidence-based research study that focuses on workers in the entertainment industry. The report found that entertainment industry workers are at a higher risk of experiencing a mental health problem than the rest of the general population. Because of the lifestyle and the hours that people in the entertainment industry actually work, their ability to access mental health services suffers. There is significant difference in the general well-being among male and female students in the field of performing arts. It means that the general well-being of male students is better than that of female students in the field of performing arts. It implies that there is greater negativity, anxiety and frustration among the female students. There is greater stress, depression and competitiveness amongst them affecting their general well being.",

      "abstract": "The internal void or absence is often formulated in terms of the ongoing structural consequences of a profound lack in early maternal care resulting in a deficiency in psychic structure, an area of weak or non-representation. Rather than defining the psychic void solely as a lack of inner development leaving a passively experienced impoverished inner world, this paper highlights the phenomenon of libidinal investment in the original black hole in the early care-taking environment, creating an allegiance to absence, an emotional investment in a state of deadness that actively impedes experiences of vitality and psychic growth and shuts down elaboration of the generative unconscious. Because the type of early absence comes about at a time when the difference between self and non-self is still developing, language and other types of communication that clearly define self and other may not be the most useful methods of broaching these early unformulated states. Treating an allegiance to absence requires that the primary attachment, or absence thereof, becomes actualized in treatment in the relationship between patient and analyst, the unique manifestations of which bring to life the absence in the here and now where it can be experienced and transformed.",

      "title": "The evolution of communication: Humans may be exceptional",
      "abstract": "Communication is a fundamentally interactive phenomenon. Evolutionary biology recognises this fact in its definition of communication, in which signals are those actions that cause reactions, and where both action and reaction are designed for that reason. Where only one or the other is designed then the behaviours are classed as either cues or coercion. Since mutually dependent behaviours are unlikely to emerge simultaneously, the symmetry inherent in these definitions gives rise to a prediction that communication will only emerge if cues or coercive behaviours do so first. They will then be co-opted for communication. A range of case studies, from animal signalling, evolutionary robotics, comparative psychology, and evolutionary linguistics are used to test this prediction. The first three are found to be supportive. However in the Embodied Communication Game, a recent experimental approach to the emergence of communication between adult humans, communication emerges even when cues or coerced behaviours are not possible. This suggests that humans are exceptional in this regard. It is argued that the reason for this is the degree to which we are able and compelled to read and interpret the behaviour of others in intentional terms.",

      "abstract": "What is a woman? Hadn't we better ask: ‘What does she do (in theatre)'? And then: ‘How does she do it?’. In this present context, where we are invited to consider established and possible modes of action by women within the institutions and property/ties of theatre, then we need absolutely to ask whether ‘what a woman does’ in the 1990s, is usefully categorised in terms of biological identity. That the feminine and the masculine are morphologically bound‐in to the female and the male has never been particularly useful to an analysis of modes of action. The first and last terms ('feminine‐masculine’ and ‘modes of action') relate to symbolic practices in and on the world, whereas the middle term differentiates between biological specificities. The first and last can be changed, whereas biological identity cannot. What happens when the two sets are overlaid, and where effective action is conflated with a specific biological identity? Answer: we have bound ourselves in to the very dramas which we thought to subvert, historicize or counter, proving by our political intervention itself that ‘we’ are indeed reactive. The alternative is to sidestep the anxious categoriser: s/he wastes her energies in and on confrontation. I want to speak up here for the exceptional, singular and successful practitioner of theatre, and to point out that that practitioner may very well already be a woman, as well as an exceptional one. Let me add at once: as singular, and exceptional, a theatre persona signing signature events, she has already forged her place within, and hereafter will expand but also conserve the institutions of theatre. Does that make her complicit with the patriarchy?",

      "abstract": "Can Relationality be Distinguished from Abstractness in Noun Mutability? Dedre Gentner (gentner@northwestern.edu) Department of Psychology, Northwestern University Evanston, IL 60208 USA Jennifer A. Asmuth (asmuth@northwestern.edu) Department of Psychology, Northwestern University Evanston, IL 60208 USA psychological properties of these two kinds of concepts. Nouns can often be categorized as entity or relational according to whether they take arguments (To be an enemy, you have to be an enemy of someone or something, but you can be a person without further ado.) For relational nouns like carnivore that don’t need arguments, Asmuth and Gentner (2005) proposed the fetch test as a way of distinguishing entity and relational categories: if you are asked to find a member of the category, how do you know one when you see it? For an entity category like wolf, you need only consider the entity itself—its intrinsic properties suffice to identify it. But for a relational category like carnivore, intrinsic properties are not enough: you need to verify its relations to other entities (namely, that it eats animals). You can tell which items in the room are apples just by looking at them, but you can’t tell which things are gifts or weapons without knowing about their relations to other entities. Apart from the intrinsic interest of relational and entity concepts, relational nouns are important in that they figure strongly in adult discourse. Our informal ratings of the 100 highest frequency nouns in the British National Corpus revealed that close to half were relational nouns. For example, consider the following sentences: Abstract Previous studies have suggested that relational concepts are more mutable—more prone to change meaning in context— than entity concepts even when both relational and entity concepts are denoted by nouns (Asmuth & Gentner, 2005; Feist & Ferez, 2007). However, relationality is a complex dimension, and is highly correlated with other factors such as imageability and abstractness. In the current research, we compared the mutability of entity nouns and relational nouns while controlling for imageability (as well as frequency). People read these nouns in a given context and then had to recognize them in either the same or different context. We found that (1) participants showed greater recognition sensitivity for entity nouns than for relational nouns; and (2) recognition of relational nouns was more impaired by a change in context than was recognition of entity nouns. We conclude that the encoding of relational nouns is more influenced by context than the encoding of entity nouns and discuss parallels with encoding patterns for verbs and nouns. Keywords: sensitivity relational language; mutability; context Introduction Most psychological research on concepts has focused on entity concepts, such as cat or tomato, which are defined by common properties and belong to taxonomic hierarchies. However, recently there has been increased interest in relational concepts (Jones & Love, 2007; Feist & Ferez, 2007; Gentner, 2005; Gentner & Kurtz, 2005; Anggoro, Gentner & Klibanoff, 2005; Barr & Caplan, 1987; Markman & Stillwell, 2001). Relational categories are those whose membership is determined by common relational structure (such as extrinsic relations to other entities), rather than by common properties (see Gentner & Kurtz, 2005). For example, for X to be a carnivore, X must eat animals; for X to be a bridge, X must connect two other points or entities. The members of relational categories may share few or no intrinsic properties: e.g., sharks, eagles, tigers, and spiders are all carnivores. Relational categories thus contrast with entity categories like bird, whose members share large numbers of intrinsic properties. Interestingly, both entity concepts and relational concepts can be denoted by nouns (e.g., person versus enemy). This makes them an apt arena in which to compare the (1) This goal has priority until the performance deadline has passed. (2) The dog chased the ball across the field. Sentences like (1)—which contains mostly relational nouns—are more likely to occur in adult conversation than are sentences like (2). To understand the importance of relational nouns in our everyday discourse, try to express the meaning of (1) without using relational nouns. Relational nouns are similar to verbs and prepositions, in that their meanings are centered around extrinsic relations with other concepts 1 . Like verbs, relational nouns take an The extent of this extrinsic structure varies across different types of relational nouns. A distinction can be made between two kinds of relational nouns: schema nouns, such as robbery, denote relational systems and are defined by internal relational structure; role nouns, such as thief, are defined by extrinsic relations to the other entities in a relational schema (see Markman & Stillwell",

      "title": "Empathy, Altruism, and Interstellar Communication",
      "abstract": "If we consider a potential addressee of an interstellar message (AIM), would it be endowed with the empathic ability needed to understand our communicative intent? Consider the following speculation: if AIM has the technology to receive an interstellar message, then it is then highly probable that its society would be based on, and its achievements the result of, a reasonably high degree of cooperation among its members. Cooperation, in turn, is hardly conceivable without an ability to recognize and express emotions and intentions. However, even if my speculation about AIM’ s alleged empathic skills is sound, why should we suppose that our message would fulfill its purpose? After all, where there is no common code, the bodily signs conveyed through direct visual or tactile contact with an empathizing agent seem to be the only means of making an intention known. Can the message itself somehow indicate the presence of an empathizing mind when such direct contact is lacking, as in interstellar communication via electromagnetic radiation? What is the minimal shared context to be anticipated in the case of an interstellar communication? Surely three-dimensional space, the direction of time flow, physical laws, chemical elements and compounds, items of the macro-world (planets, stars, galaxies), and gravity and its consequences are all sufficiently universal to be good candidates for salient features of our shared context. One might even add biological and social features to the list, such as embodiment, mortality, producing and rearing offspring, and living in groups. But what are the chances that AIM would mentally represent these features in the same way that we represent them? For if they do not, it seems that any shared context simply cannot do its job. Lacking any clue how to forestall this difficulty, I come to my concluding proposal. In some specific cases of behavior classified as communication, there is no other content of the message besides the very intention to communicate that it is a message. My point is that for understanding such a reduced message, the requirements regarding the cognitive capacities of the receiver may be much less demanding than for understanding messages with a genuine representational content. It is not only that a successful transmission of a rich representational content requires a rich representational system (code). Such a transmission also requires a common context in the sense of a psychological construct consisting of an unidentifiable supply of background assumptions necessary for figuring out the implicatures of the explicit (directly decodable) part of the message. Being short of this context, we should satisfy ourselves with a message that would simply reveal the fact that we are beings capable of expressing and recognizing intentions. In such a case, revealing our communicative intention would in effect be identical to a sign (indication) - in the sense of Grice’ s natural meaning of altruism towards another being (in this case, an extraterrestrial). The only requirement for understanding such a message would be a minimum of empathic abilities on the part of our unknown addressee.",

      "abstract": "growth of studies of our potentials is giving us a new feeling about Introduction and Focuses In the accumulating enormous range of information and deeper understanding of many other cultures than our own, we can see how a society's attitude toward a being has changed. As the metamorphoses of our ways of knowing throughout our history begin to take shape, we a way to see through the maze of information, to find broad outlines and unifications. A good deal has already been written this direction. It is hoped that the following considerations may move this trend forward an area of great concern to all of us, wherever we may be living. We can begin by exploring some differences between and nonhuman. Human has been contrasted with machine-like, mechanical, devoid of feelings. Human may also be contrasted with animalistic, a pejorative term when referring to a person. Or, may be differentiated from some mythical superhuman being, with implications of inferiority. Thus, we say, He is only human if someone makes a mistake or loses control of his feelings, is involved some misdemeanor, or acts irresponsibly. The growth of studies of our potentials is giving us a new feeling about ourselves. Articles are being written on the sense of giving the worker a feeling of dignity on his job, providing him a chance for using his imagination, getting away from dull mechanical routine. Humanizing is different from anthropomorphizing when referring to a machine, or a computer, for instance. Those who work with computers know their present limitations, besides their great help. As John C. Eccles said, the computer does not recognize unexpected messages ... (1) Would cultivating an appreciation for artistic works influence a person toward behaving more humanly? Many believe so, or did believe so until they became disillusioned from events World War II. It is well known that the Nazis spent evenings listening to Mozart and Beethoven and the very next morning committed horrible brutalities the concentration camps a few miles away. In his paper on Communications and Information Theory Dr. Dan McLachlan, Jr., gives us a clue to the relation of human-ness to the theory, when he writes: Meaning, value, and are not to be discussed here because they have not been investigated to any extent such as has been done on information theory or communication general. These words are rarely found books of science, and it is unfortunate that they have not been because these are such words [italics mine] and the future decency of our race depends so much on our understanding of them. Such expressions as moral values or cultural values are difficult to handle. Such terms as in want or in dire need have a pretty diffuse line of distinction. (2) While any terms we use -- no matter which -- involve some assumptions and problems of ferreting them out, are there some ways of speaking about humanizing that do not get us into as much of a quagmire as some others? If at every moment of investigating, the person who is observing becomes an integral part of the observation, it is not possible to get away from some kind of values, or from the assumptions hidden the very terms and categories that are used to talk about the research. Some Criteria as Guides The following considerations are suggested as guides our context for investigating: 1. The kind of behavior we classify as uniquely human. 2. The holistic character of the premises, based on the principle of the organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment. 3. The terminology used for investigating, and its applicability to the functioning of the nervous system. 4. …",

      "abstract": "For love as a feeling to become a form of commitment, for passion to turn into a psychic couple, members will byuild a specific link, the conjugal bond. This link creates a gap between the partners, such a gap being necessary for each of them to be connected, and to live as an individual. The greater the desire for fusion, the more concrete the gapbecomes, leading to no sexual intercourse, somatizations, violent behaviour, appearence of an outsider. The couple symptom, created by the couple, itself, replaces the internalisation of the third agency. The link puts into place defensive collusions, wich are signs of fixation echoing the partners' pregenital histories. The return of the repressed leads real symptoms to appear and to a crisis. The psychical work supplied to overcome crises works out of collusion. With each other and through each other, the partners gradually untangle what had beeen previously condensed in thise collusions. The working over then leads onto the link either becoming stronger or disappearing totally, allowing each one to progressively integrate elements awaiting symbolisation that were until then collusive. Under such circumstances, the psychical work provided by the couple may be seen as organising or reorganising its psyche, and enabling the partners to work over again the original mourning and that of the oedipien parents. In order to achieve this work, the setting and the couple as supporting group agencies must be reliable and the link must be objectal and libidinal enough. Dual therapy offers consulting ailing partners to form such a supporting group agency. It enables the link to be created afresh, the workin out of the differentiation inside the dyad and the projections of the internal object upon the real objects.",

      "abstract": "Human beings live in language and only they can take responsibility for how they think and act. So what understandings of response are possible? The relationship between responsibility and response-abilty is explored in the light of emerging critiques of the prevailing Western attitude to reason, viz: Lakoff and Johnson's (1999) fundamental challenge to prevailing models of Western thought. They argue that reason (on which much practice is built, including research practice) is: (i) not disembodied, but arises from the nature of our brains, bodies and bodily experience; (ii) evolutionary, in that abstract reason builds on and makes use of perceptual and motor inference present in 'lower' animals; (iii) is not universal in the transcendent sense but rather universal in that it is a capacity all humans share; (iv) mostly unconscious; (v) largely metaphorical and imaginative and (vi) not dispassionate but emotionally engaged.\r\n\r\nSystems practice is introduced as a means to orchestrate a particular type of conversation; it is also an ecological conversation. As a species our unique selling point is that we can engage in conversation. In the process we bring forth both ourselves and our world. To converse is to turn together, to dance, and thus an ecological conversation is a tango of responsibility. A conversation is inventive, unpredictable and is always particularizing to place and people.\r\n\r\nDrawing on experiences of teaching systems thinking and practice for environmental decision making a praxiology is outlined for stakeholder responsibility and response-ability. It is argued that capacity building in systemic inquiry and the design of learning systems are central to this praxiology.",

      "abstract": "ONE CAN RECOGNIZE confluence of two tributaries in what I will call language problem. The first of these (a secular and, to some extent, a psychological tributary) involves inevitable distortion that arises when translating an inner experience into an outer expression. may regard this distortion as either random or motivated, as either error or as bias. In either case it results in speech untrue to underlying thought. I find other source in realm of religion: In beginning was Word, and Word was with God, and Word was God. that Word, religion often tells us, had divine qualities and perfection, while our words, so uniquely human, so characteristically mortal, appear inherently corrupt and fallible. Both of these tributaries lead to same paradoxical, absurd conclusion: Language, which apparently functions to serve as a tool of communication, cannot fulfill its goal. Notice that argument goes far beyond criticizing language for its imperfection and ambiguity, or for not always meeting expectations. Instead, language problem refers to a state of affairs where we contrast inner truth with outer falsehood: Human speech conceals rather than reveals. In every generation, philosophers, linguists, poets, and other reflective thinkers rediscover and elaborate this basic idea, with or without its religious overtone. The following quotations express this common theme, despite differences in ideology and style: * Adorno (1973a, pp. 52-3): But no matter how hard we try for linguistic expression of such a history congealed in things, words we use will remain concepts. Their precision substitutes for thing itself, without quite bringing its selfhood to mind; there is a gap between words and thing they conjure. And again (1973b, p. 59): ...language no longer allows anything to be said, as it is expressed. Either it is reified and banal of commodities and falsities thought from start. Or it installs itself, ceremonious without ceremony, mighty without might...in short, of sort that Hofmannsthal attacked in George School. * St. Augustine, circa 400 (1876, Sermon xii, 600-1): God is true and every man a liar. * Bacon, quoted in Harris (1981): Words still manifestly force understanding, throw everything into confusion, and lead mankind into vain and innumerable controversies and fallacies. * Bateson (1972, p. 275): We are so befuddled by language that we cannot think straight... * Berger (1912, p. 221): Before Verb, Word par excellence, all speech will be fruitless. here, for us ourselves, we have a scarcity of words... * Bialik (1917/1950): For it is clear that language with all its associations does not introduce us at all into inner area, essence of things, but that, on contrary, language itself stands as a barrier before them. * Brecht (1967, vol. I, 187) in Jungle of Cities: Garga: Language is not enough for understanding. Shlink replies: ...the only union is that of sexual organs, but even this cannot bridge over chasm made by speech. * Browning (1869, Ch. 12, line 838): Our human speech is naught. (1) * Christy (1979, pp. 980-1), attacks what he calls Medspeak, i.e. language interns and residents use to serve the need to hide. Meaning is drained out, communication ceases to exist, thought wilts, action is paralyzed. (2) * Eliot (1936, p. 152). Sweeney in Fragment of an Agon, apologetically: But I've gotta use words when I talk to you... * Frege (1918), quoted in Harris (1981): One fights against language. * Goethe (circa 1800), quoted in Huxley (1954, pp. 73-4): We talk far too much. should talk less and draw more. I personally should like to renounce speech altogether and, like organic Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches. …",

Whatever occurs, a gesture, a word, is denied by the next word or gesture. Physiology is the subject to a constant catabolism. The decomposition - the biological and psychological miseries, engulfs in our century a sort of medieval macabre dance, an endless, never-ending triumph of death. But more than the miseries of the biological degradation, we are obsessed by the degradation of meanings, the dissolution of the linguistic structures, the overthrow of the values. As soon as one thing acquires a meaning, it becomes volatile, disappears, and the work remains nude, meaningless. The symbols represent the characters’ direct communication of the complex reality they live in. The affection the Beckett’s characters or the daily life routine, the real situations they express, always have a symbolic equivalence or correspondence. Thus, Beckett describes specific points of view about the world, it shows a specific way to establish relationships between facts that the common sense does not usually correlate with. The symbols could not be presented in a clearer and more meaningful way by the writer, the symbolic object leaving a margin of inaccuracy, ambiguity, which demands intensively the affective involvement of the character to whom it is addressed.",

      "title": "The Nightmare of Health: Metaphysics and Ethics in the Signification of Disability",
      "abstract": "The Nightmare of Health:Metaphysics and Ethics in the Signification of Disability Scott DeShong (bio) Signification and Possibility Snyder, Brueggeman, and Garland-Thompson consider disability \"a fundamental human experience\" as well as \"the ubiquitous unspoken topic of contemporary culture\" (2). This is accurately stated but oblique, as it is ability, more precisely, that is the ubiquitous topic, and a topic not only difficult to recognize but even to speak—perhaps a topic that is unspeakable. The study of disability tends to suggest this reversal, while often reversing the way sociocultural articulations appear to work, such as when disability critiques seek to expose reification. Indeed, the theoretical study of disability is concerned largely with the assumption of ability, with ableist assumptions that emerge constantly, by which behaviors and conditions appear as if they were real or natural. Confronting discourses about defective eyes or legs, or about mental or emotional affliction—features that putatively cause one's inability to see or walk or cope—a disability critique will often recognize that, in the language of ability, seeing, walking, and coping are themselves being defined and thus emerge as at best interpretations of the supposed psychosomatic realities, realities that are revealed to emerge posterior to the always ad hoc, if naturalized, interpretive terms.1 Insofar as the study of disability becomes itself caught up in such a reversal, such study becomes defined according to what it does: not primarily concerned with the body or the mind, nor with specifically defined impairments, but rather with the discourse of the possible and the sociocultural context and ramifications of such discourse. [End Page 268] I wish to examine what disability means, what the study of it entails, in a way that moves beyond a critique of the word as joining with ableism, with the constitution of categorical human ability. As Peggy Phelan recognizes, any expression of disability—such as the categorical phrase \"people with disabilities\"—will tend to develop an ontology of central, standardized human ability, submitting performance to articulations of competence already established in the sociocultural imagination (322).2 Even in such expressions, however, we may hear inflections of radical difference, desire for the unnatural priority of ability to any conception of competence. Thus, we may consider how a virgule marks any expression of disability as dis/ability, marking the non-presence of ability by striking through the ostensibly simple dialectic of articulated competence and the lack of access thereto. Indeed, ability is never articulated and cannot be; all we have of ability is what we have through signification. As language provides the inevitable and impossible approach to its objects, the linguistic conditions of possibility for approach are also the conditions of impossibility, hence the im/possibility that marks dis/ability. It is redundant—if perhaps heuristically useful—to point out that nature, being, and ability are terms to be thought of as under erasure, caught as if logically posterior to incomprehensible referents, even as the referents themselves nevertheless cannot be thought of outside reference. As we view the discourse of disability participating in the sociocultural signification of ability, we concomitantly view ability as the possibility of signification. We undermine the naturalization of the sociocultural as the origin of articulation as we find articulation emerging in response to imperatives to articulate and to disarticulate. We find the imperative of overcoming the ontology of ability inherent in articulations of that ontology: we recognize the denaturing in the heart of naturalization. Of course, not only contemporary expressions of the notion of disability constitute the ableist articulation of ability. Historically, the expression of disability has articulated the recognition of categorical difference. \"Disability\" has usually indicated the emergence of specific problems inherent for a subject that are of another order than problems considered too general, pertaining to most or all subjects, or idiosyncratic, pertaining only to an individual. The characterization of deafness as involving ability different from hearing is a counterexample to commonly noted expressions of disability, expressions by which difficulty has typically been cited as the primary feature of a condition. [End Page 269] And whereas earlier in history—pre-Enlightenment, in the West—supposed difficulty, strangeness, and deformity may have aided in the development of centralized ideals...",

Background Homebound persons have a significantly higher mortality risk as well as physical and psychosocial burden. A clarification of the term is necessary to develop preventive measures. Design Concept analysis. Data Sources Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Scopus) and definitions from online dictionaries. Review Methods Walker and Avant's method was applied to guide the concept analysis. To prevent arbitrary and empty results in determining the attributes, antecedents, and consequences a thematic analysis was carried out. Results Homebound is defined as an enduring condition in which the life-space is reduced to the home, but moving around in the home is possible (by walking short distances alone or by holding on to furniture, or with the help of a stick, walker, or another person). Homebound has six attributes: in need of help in ADL/IADL and in leaving the life-space, powerlessness, life-space confinement, mobility limitation, endurance, and weakness. Physiological instability and physical immobility are antecedents with wide-ranging influencing factors as illness, complexity, burden, and endogenous/exogenous booster. Homebound has also wide-ranging consequences such as the progression of inactivity, physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual problems. Conclusions The multidimensional concept of homebound modifies the concepts of mobility and immobility. Given the extensive consequences of homebound nurses play a central role in the prevention.",

      "abstract": "The article describes the anti-value concept of gluttony in the humorous discourse of English-language stand-up and situation comedies. The main humorous characteristics of this concept are identified and analyzed. An axiological approach is used for constructing a humorous conceptual framework, because humor is one of the most important tools for forming values and anti-values of a certain culture. The ridiculed characteristics of gluttony are divided into the following two groups: those of process and result. The main characteristics of the process include improper eating of edible items and eating of inedible items. Improper eating of edible items is usually ridiculed through eating excessive amounts of food, eating food under inappropriate conditions, eating incompatible items. Eating of inedible items is mostly ridiculed through eating life-threatening objects, eating something unfit to eat, and eating excrements or other human waste products. The main ridiculed characteristics of the result include gaining excess weight, addiction to a certain food, illness/death of a person. This work also performs a detailed analysis of the anti-value concept of gluttony for the first time. The main linguistic means of representing the anti-value concept of gluttony in stand-up comedies and sitcoms are revealed. This article makes a significant contribution to constructing an axiological humorous framework of the concept, because gluttony is one of the basic anti-values in humorous discourse.",

The loss of meaning of life is a hidden killer; it is like a worm eating the apple from within. A total loss of meaning always signifies a major life crisis or even a life coming soon to its end, but most often meaning of life is only partially lost. This partial loss is really much more tricky than a total loss because people set up mental defenses that hinder them from noticing the loss. After a while, the lack of meaning of life will be materialized in poor quality of life, mental and somatic symptoms, including depression or pain, and reduced ability to function sexually, socially, and in work.

      "title": "Descriptions of Simple Spatial Scenes in English and Japanese",
      "abstract": "Abstract How do people describe the location of a target object to another? This task requires a reference object or frame and terms of reference. Traditional linguistic analyses have loosely organized perspectives around people, objects, or environments as reference objects, using reference terms based on a viewpoint or the intrinsic sides of an object, such as left, right, front, and back or based on the environment, such as north, south, east, and west. In actual communication, social, spatial, and cognitive factors may also affect perspective choice. We examine those factors by varying the spatial information (landmarks and cardinal directions), the communication task (relative cognitive burden to speakers and addressees), and the culture of participants (American and Japanese). Speakers used addressees' perspectives more when addressees had the greater cognitive burden. They also used landmarks and cardinal directions when they were available, especially to avoid difficult discriminations like left/right. Some cases appearing to be perspective taking can be interpreted as using a person as a landmark. Finally, terms like near indicating close proximity were preferred to far and to terms requiring projection of directions. Globally, perspective choices of American and Japanese samples were strikingly similar; that is, Japanese did not select addressees' perspectives more than Americans. The traditional linguistic analyses need to be enhanced to account for effects of cognitive, situational, and social factors.",

      "title": "Behaviorally adaptive objects",
      "abstract": "In conventional object systems, the functional behavior of an object follows patterns that have been ingrained into it upon its creation. This makes it impossible, or at best highly cumbersome, to permit an object to participate — successively or concurrently — in a number of object societies of largely divergent goals and tasks and, hence, with environments of divergent and changing message needs. What seems desirable, instead, is a variation of the traditional object model in which an object itself becomes aware of the situation it is in or may move to, then adapt its currently desirable behavior accordingly. Awareness means that the environment must become observable to the object, which in turns requires some sharing of state information among objects. Adaptation entails that an object must be capable of associating with different (though perhaps overlapping) sets of operations, or adjust the effects of its operations. The paper, by taking its cues from role models and relationship models, demonstrates that both objectives can be met by a slight modification of the object paradigm that splits an object into two parts, a kernel called crystal which carries the identity of the object and, hence, is the addressee of messages, and constructs called contexts, which a crystal may variably connect to, across which the internal and external states of the object and the operators are spread, and which respond to the messages while the crystal coordinates these responses. A notion of situation forms the centerpiece of typing. The paper motivates the choice of model, defines and illustrates the basic constructs of the model, describes how a particular behavior can be obtained and adapted, considers how typing can be achieved under the changing conditions, and finally reports on first experiences in design, implementation and application. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

This deficiency, which is often resented by others and is initially misunderstood, rubs off on the person who is affected and risks of demoralizing and discouraging her. Strengthening of the ego and personality development of the deaf as a whole autonomous person increases her self confidence and helps her build a solid identity. However, the question often asked: what is the identity of a deaf person? Hearing, deaf or bicultural? What is her future? Before getting any recognition from others, the deaf person needs to know herself. This return to oneself requires her to have knowledge of her own abilities, cultural background and an important feeling of security (a place among his people). The motivation for a better future is a prerequisite for a healthy and balanced development, both from the relational and mental domain. Under what conditions does the deaf person live? Is it framed, loved, recognized? Is it informed, directed, monitored? What image does she have of her own body? What factors from an early age are put into play? What image does she have of herself or what image do we reflect on her? Why? The type of equipment offered, cochlear implants or conventional hearing aid, do they play a role? In this study several factors are being explored; they deal with the problems and issues of the deaf person, the experiences of the person as having a hearing deficiency, the nature and severity of the condition that affects the person and also how this person perceives her own image, consequently her identity and her future.",

      "abstract": "Abstract ‘The evolution of consciousness’ begins with two questions. Firstly, which living creatures are conscious and in what way? Secondly, when and how did consciousness evolve? Consciousness could be an all-or-nothing phenomenon, with some creatures having it and others not. Or it might be a continuous variable, with some having more than others. The theories of evolution of consciousness range from those that place its origin way back with the emergence of life itself, through intermediates linking it with the evolution of perception, intelligence, or other general abilities, to those that tie it to language, imitation, or memes. The future of consciousness research is also considered.",

      "title": "Swarm Exquisite-Corpses Games",
      "abstract": "Abstract The Exquisite Corpse is a game-based art form popularized by the surrealists. The final result is based on an unconscious collaboration of collective artists; each provides his or her part without knowing what the other has selected. For example, each one provides adjective, verb and noun to create poems; head, torso and legs for drawings. Actually, concerning drawings, each one draws his part in a piece of paper and folds it, so the next artist is able to see the border traces in the folded column and normally begins from there. The exquisite Corpse is a game with several interesting properties: 1. It’s an example of collective creation and formation of a collective pattern; 2. We can envision a micro and macro levels, even if there are not so many participants 3. There is no unity, there is author fragmentation and so the complete outcome cannot be intended and planned in advance; 4. In fact, we are in face of an unpredictable and surprising outcome; 5. There is no direct communication between the participants, besides the fact that they are going to draw some predetermined part, they do not communicate at all or they communicate indirectly through the work (traces in the folded zones); 6. Nobody has a bird eye view of the work in progress, they are restricted to their own local zone. Our contribution to this Symposium is an artificial painting tool that has several properties of the Exquisite Corpse Game but in a much bigger scale in the sense that we can have thousands of very simple micro-painters limited to a very narrow and local area that will try to coordinate and to make emerge a collective pattern. In this tool we can try out different types of coordination between painters and see the resulting pattern exploring the link between the macro and micro-level, In contrast with the Exquisite Corpse Game which is sequential, in our painting society, artists work in parallel and they can communicate either directly or indirectly through the painting. We will begin to describe a coordination type based only on a stigmergic form of communication between painters. The artificial canvas has dynamic properties where artificial pheromones can be produced, diffused and evaporated. They are the communication medium and they control the movements of individuals. For example, the non-painted areas will produce chemical that will diffuse and attract painters making strange and unpredictable patterns appear. We will also describe other types of agent coordination based on imitation where some consensual attributes, like color or orientation, or position, will emerge, creating some order on a potential collective chaos. This consensus can die out, randomly or by interaction factors, and new consensual attributes can win resulting in heterogeneous paintings with interesting patterns, which would be difficult to achieve if made by human hands. We think that our main contribution, besides the creative exploration of new artistic spaces with swarm-art, will be in the sense of showing the possibilities of generating unpredictable and surprising patterns from the interaction of individual behaviors controlled by very simple rules. This interaction between the micro and macro levels in the artistic realm can be the source of new artistic patterns and also can foster imagination and creativity.",

In some situations, I can effectively communicate some idea or belief simply by nodding my head or blinking my eyes. Even the absence of overt body movement can communicate, as when you stare blankly at me after I ask you a question. We interpret the lack of body movement as meaningful precisely because bodily motion normally communicates.",

Selves progress within known ranges, so looking at other people, events, processes, and languages provides guidance as much as looking at your self. Self progresses seemingly in episodes with memory rewriting the past many times.

That is, the apparatus of third person reflexive (or fourth person) verb endings is not used 1 In contrast to constructions built on the connective (or relative) verb moods, expressing causation, coincidence in time, contingency, etc., where reflexive third person endings on the dependent mood are obligatorily used to affirm identity with the subject of the main verb, and even more so the subordinative (or appositionalis or conjunctive) verb mood where the subject is obligatorially the same as that of the main verb. .

      "abstract": "Contempt is the feeling when one judges another person as an inferior human being, and is typically expressed through social exclusion. Feeling contempt thus implies rejecting others, considering others as unworthy of one’s attention. Contempt is often mixed with other emotions, such as anger, hatred, or socio-moral disgust. Often therefore, the expression of contempt can coincide with feelings of revenge or even attempts to attack the other person. I think contempt is a moral emotion, in that it is often elicited in response to transgressions that are considered as amoral. These include behaviors such as betrayal, theft, (sexual) violence, which go against our moral standards and therefore deserve only contempt. These types of transgressions are too awful to criticize, and therefore can only lead to rejection or exclusion. Although we may feel contempt towards people we hardly know, contempt often develops out of anger, especially when we have been confronted with others or other groups who have not changed their behavior in reaction to our anger. Anger therefore does not seem functional, and contempt emerges as a way of coping with the lack of influence or control we have over the other.",

Environmental noise interferes with basic human activities such as sleep, communication, and thought and thus has serious negative effects on health, interpersonal relationships, work, and learning. The stress and discomfort that an individual experiences as an immediate result of noise exposure is compounded by the additional stress that results from lack of sleep, miscommunication, impaired mental functioning and the myriad social and economic consequences of such reductions in the individual's ability to function properly. It should not be surprising, therefore, that the stress caused by prolonged exposure to environmental noise can lead to heart disease and other stress-related maladies.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of research indicates that children do not understand mental representation until around age 4. However, children engage in pretend play by age 2, and pretending seems to require understanding mental representation. This apparent contradiction has been reconciled by the claim that in pretense there is precocious understanding of mental representation. 4 studies tested this claim by presenting children with protagonists who were not mentally representing something (i.e., an animal), either because they did not know about the animal or simply because they were not thinking about being the animal. However, the protagonists were acting in ways that could be consistent with pretending to be that animal. Children were then asked whether the protagonists were pretending to be that animal, and children tended to answer in the affirmative. The results suggest that 4-year-olds do not understand that pretending requires mental representation. Children appear to misconstrue pretense as its common external manifestations, such as actions, until at least the sixth year.",

The priorities can be different, even alternative in their context and opposite in their sense; eternal and temporary; truth and false; real and illusory; clear and subconscious or rational ones. The religion does not exist without the human factor, it has lost its sense, context, role, display, etc. The community without religion has never occurred. Each person and each community appeals to a religious source. A religion in its intrinsic sense is an embodiment of some axiological knowledge, search for a transcendental phenomenon. The religious approach to the moral values contains the deep considering of life sense independently of a person realization sphere. To conclude, while considering the specific features of the modern youth religious values, the two main factors can be named that influence on their functioning: spontaneity and rationality. A person has always been in their interaction. This is the core of a personal existential choice, a man has a real right for freedom, existence, and obtains an opportunity to understand the responsibility for the self existence through internal law, the law of conscience.",

Wacquant himself says his attempt to solve the problem took the form of adopting a strategy of mixing different styles of writing, and different modes of address. The latter far outpace and utterly reconfigure the possibilities for capturing, conveying, communicating and developing knowledge and discourse about embodiment. The embodied knowledge of pugilism both is and is not a knowledge of, from, or centred on or in 'the guts'.",

      "abstract": "Mead considers that the data for solving the problems of social psychology were to be found in the conduct and experience of men rather than in the behavior of lower animals or in the facts of physiology. The ongoing social process was his starting-point, and man was assumed to be a part of nature, entirely and without residue. In the analysis of conscious reflective action he found use for all the psychological concepts. The social nature of man was assumed, and the self is shown to have its origin in communication which leads in man to self-stimulation and self-response and the taking of the role of the other. Personality is a role in a social situation. Every self is in a social context. Auditory gestures are of first importance in self-stimulation; and when one becomes his own object, he achieves selfhood. The conception of the self is therefore dependent on the defining responses of others, which responses are abstracted into a \"generalized other.\" Significant symbols, used with a consciousness of their meaning, occur only in man. Besides numerous original concepts which Mead proposed, he also gave new definition to many already familiar notions, such as imagination, perception, and attention, by relating them to action, either as phases of the act or determined by it. In his doctrine of \"the I and the me,\" he found for himself an escape from a mechanistic view of human nature and a fresh defense of responsibility and freedom.",

      "abstract": "Animals exhibit species-typical adaptations of behavior and may suffer stress in captivity if they are prevented from performing these patterns of behavior. This article considers whether these particular 'needs' rely on cognitive processes or are performed without complex cognition despite their appearance of behavioral complexity. Emotion and cognition in animals are also discussed, particularly whether animals can feel emotions and, if so, what ranges of emotions they might feel. Cognitive capacities that would contribute to suffering include empathy with the suffering of others, memories of negative events and suffering in anticipation of future events. Cognitive bias of individual animals toward positive or negative feelings is related to dominance of the left or right hemisphere, respectively. These biases might be reflected in the animal's preferred limb to pick up food. Hence, limb preference could be a useful measure of cognitive bias. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a cognitive condition that, it is suggested, might involve dominance of the right hemisphere. This debilitating condition is experience-dependent and not infrequently seen in animals in captivity. In conclusion, it is argued that there is an obvious need for more research on cognition as it relates to animal welfare and as a basis for changing legislature to protect animals from suffering.

      "abstract": "'Thrill', cognate with 'thirl', meant to pierce, to penetrate, to bore something, again causing a high-pitched sound. Corresponding to these highly aggressive meanings, philobatic people are usually imagined as robust, upstanding, conquering heroes, enjoying their independence, unflinchingly facing dangers, and defiantly going their own way. Auto-erotic activities, in fact all sexual activities as well as thrills, have a good deal in common. The grammatical forms—middle voice, reflexive or intransitive forms—are also used for the expression of another most important relationship, the field of auto-erotic activities, from scratching to masturbation. It has long been known that over-indulgently brought up children masturbate on the whole much more intensely than the average child. If the environment is greatly indifferent right from the start and the neglected child hardly ever experiences loving human contact, both his object relationships and his auto-erotic activities will become stunted, as was clearly demonstrated by R. Spitz's films on severely deprived children.",

      "title": "Communicating Without Conventions",
      "abstract": "For obvious and very good reasons the study of human communication is dominated by the study of language. But from a psychological point of view, the basic structure of human communication – how it works pragmatically in terms of the intentions and inferences involved - is totally independent of language. The most important data here are acts of human communication that do not employ conventions. In situations in which language is for some reason not an option, people often produce spontaneous, non-conventionalized gestures, including most prominently pointing (deictic gestures) and pantomiming (iconic gestures). These gestures are universal among humans and unique to the species, and in human evolution they almost certainly preceded conventional communication, either signed or vocal. For prelinguistic infants to communicate effectively via pointing and pantomiming, they must already possess species-unique and very powerful skills and motivations for shared intentionality as pragmatic infrastructure. Conventional communication is then built on top of this infrastructure - or so I will argue.",

People learn to play the harp by playing the harp; people learn to become more discerning, more exacting, more articulate, in their perceptions of moral life by practicing discernment, exactitude, and articulateness. Metaphor momentarily stabilizes in language a novel way of seeing—a way of seeing one thing as another, or a way of seeing one thing in the light of another. But then people also make sense, in Williams' sense, of their experience by seeing connections and resemblances between the long-form narrative plot lines within an imaginary literary world and the unfolding of people's lives in the real one. The emergence of plot, the long-form aspect under which we see and interconnect a web of particulars, can be sudden, or gradual.",

      "abstract": "Psychophysiological science consider foundations of the mind is exemplified as Mental processes influence the physiological state of the body and changes in the body's physiology influence thoughts, feelings and motivational behavior. However, Harmony is a ubiquitous principle based on Motivations arise from physiological need to preserve the integrity of the organism, via processes and the ways we process or react to our environment depends on our internal bodily state. For example, if we are thirsty or hungry, the manner in which we behave toward food stimuli differs and biases perceptions, hedonics, cognitions and memory. Motivations drive behavior, while changes in the internal state of the body anticipate, facilitate or accommodate the consequences of motoric action. The result is an individual system in a state of vibrant instability internally that contributed to physical and social interaction with the external environment. The individual make-ups of character and behaviors has emerged out of such patterns of chemical release. The mind is supposed to be a virtual entity, one that reflects the workings of the neural networks, chemical and hormonal systems in our brain. It cannot be localized to particular areas within the brain, though the entire cerebral cortex and deep grey matter form important components. Realization, sensitivity, conduct, intelligence, linguistic, impulse, energy, the urge to excel and intellect of the most complex kind are the product of the wide-ranging and multifaceted linkages between the different parts of the brain. Likewise, anomalies attributed to the mind, such as the spectrum of illnesses dealt with by psychoanalysts are consequences of widespread aberrations, often in the chemical processes within different parts of the brain.",

      "title": "Anthropomorphic devices for affective touch communication",
      "abstract": "Communicating emotions is important for human attachment and bonding as well as for physical and psychological well-being.We communicate emotions through voice, but also through body language such as facial expressions, posture or touch. Among all these nonverbal cues, the tactile modality plays a particular role. Touch happens in co-located situations and involves physical contact between two individuals. A touch contact can convey emotions such as comforting someone by gently stroking her arm.Current technologies and devices used for mediated communication are not designed to support affective touch communication.There is a need to have new interfaces to mediate touch, both to detect touch (to replace the receiver's skin) and to convey touch (to replace the emitter's hand).My approach takes inspiration from the human body to inform the design of new interfaces. I promote the use of anthropomorphic affordances to design interfaces that benefit from our knowledge of physical interaction with other humans.Anthropomorphic affordances project human functioning and behaviour to the attributes of an object to suggest ways of using it. However, anthropomorphism has received little attention so far in the field of Human-Computer Interaction; its design space is still largely unexplored. In this thesis, I explore this design space and focus on augmenting mobile and robotic devices with tactile capabilities to enhance the conveying of emotions to enrich social communication.This raises two main research problems addressed in this thesis.A first problem is to define the type of device needed to perform touch. Current actuated devices do not produce human-like touch.In the first part of this thesis, I focus on the design and implementation of interfaces capable of producing humanlike touch output.I highlight human touch factors that can be reproduced by an actuated device. I then experimentally evaluate the impact of humanlike device-initiated touch on the perception of emotions.Finally, I built on top of these findings to propose Mobilimb, a small-scale robotic arm that can be connected onto mobile devices and can touch the user.A second problem is to develop interfaces capable of detecting touch input. My approach is to integrate humanlike artificial skin onto existing devices.I propose requirements to replicate the human skin, and a fabrication method for reproducing its visual, tactile and kinaesthetic properties. I then propose an implementation of artificial skin that can be integrated onto existing devices and can sense expressive touch gestures. This interface is then used to explore possible scenarios and applications for mediated touch input.In summary, this thesis contributes to the design and understanding of anthropomorphic devices for affective touch communication. I propose to use anthropomorphic affordances to design interfaces.To address the research questions of this thesis, I built upon human biological characteristics and digital fabrication tools and methods. The devices presented in this thesis propose new technical and empirical contributions around touch detection and touch generation.",

      "abstract": "The journey into the world of midwifery or nursing requires the student to attend to the intertwining of self-body-world in order to shift their knowledge of self-body-world into a client/patient-centered context. One of the teaching-learning strategies used to provide safe opportunities is the use of simulations and virtual practices. Rather than learning intimate acts of touching, or life and death decision-making in situations with actual clients/patients, students enter their learning world with rubber torsos, cloth babies, and cyber clinics. The “other” is a simulated other, not a human. How does the student shift from seeing this simulated other as object to a sense of other as subject? In our world of constant use of technology for communication and entertainment, do students shift in and out of a cyber world easily or are they more captured by the simulated experience than with the human world? Has the human world redefined itself where the intertwining of self-body-world blurs the sense of where human body ends and cyber or simulated world begins? What is the place of Bildung when engaged with a cyber other? As a result of educational challenges, including rising enrolments, limited clinical placement opportunities, and increasing risk management concerns, there has been a proliferation in the use of simulation as a teaching strategy (Fox, Damazo, 2013; Schmitt, Gilbert, Brandt, Weinstein, 2013). This has left us –the authors– wondering about the student experience of simulation. What do they learn? How do they learn? How can this learning be applied in practice?",

Also horses display a differentiated expressive behaviour, which can be observed and analysed by humans. Moreover it could be demonstrated, that in situations of stress the display shown by horses (gesture, facial expression, posture) correlate with corresponding physiological reactions.

Acute stress is essential for survival, enabling an animal to deal with the initiating stressors in a manner that will enhance the animal's chances of survival. However, many animals experience chronic stress — regular and/or continuous exposure to stressors at levels and proximities that the animal is unable to control or alter. Such stressors can lead to physiological and emotional distress and impaired welfare. The dog that is left alone in the home can become trapped in an environment for which it has no coping strategies or, due to circumstances outside its control, may have lost its previous coping strategies. Such dogs suffer daily impairments in welfare.",

      "title": "USING GENERAL SEMANTICS TO MANAGE 'EMOTIONS'",
      "abstract": "AS KORZYBSKI SUGGESTED do when analyzing a term, my first step in addressing the title topic was to consult a dictionary for definitions of emotion. (1) From Webster's 9th Collegiate (1987): Emotion: 1 a: obs: DISTURBANCE b: EXCITEMENT a: Affective aspect of consciousness; b: a state of c: psychic and physical reaction (as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as strong and physiologically involving changes that prepare the body for immediate vigorous action. Okay, how is affective defined? Affect: the conscious subjective aspect of an considered apart from bodily changes. And feeling as most directly related to emotion? 2 a: an emotional state or reaction b pl: susceptibility to impression Under syn find: FEELING denotes any partly mental, partly physical response marked by pleasure, pain, attraction, or repulsion.... My conclusions: old terminology, such as the term emotion itself and its concomitant definitions, exposes an elementalistic muddle. (2) Also, as evidenced in the going around in circles aspect of the above definitions, seem to be have reached the unspeakable level of undefined terms. Somehow know what we're intending to say, but can't quite say it. In Science and Sanity, I found relatively few indexed uses of emotion. On page 23, pointing out how to apply non-elementalism (3) when considering psycho-logical reactions, Korzybski advised that we must ... deliberately ascribe 'emotional' factors to any 'intellectual' manifestation, and 'intellectual' factors to any 'emotional' occurrence. On page 26, recognizing levels of abstracting, he noted Empirically, there is a difference between an 'emotion' which becomes 'rationalized' and 'emotions' invoked or produced by 'ideas.' On page 481: Through wrong evaluation ['is' of identity] are using the lower [thalamic] center too much and cannot 'think' properly. are 'over-emotional'; get easily confused, worried, terrorized, or discouraged; or else become absolutists, dogmatists. Again on page 481, noting the unspeakable aspect I mentioned above: We teach silence on the objective level in general, which is a most impressive 'emotional' education So, in considering Using General Semantics to Manage 'Emotions,' had best not get too concerned with any definition of emotion, lest our discussion become confusing and dogmatic. Rather, let's flag emotion as problematic by using the extensional safety device of single quotes: 'emotion.' Also the extensional hyphen, as in thoughts-feelings and intellect-emotion. Further, can replace these terms with the non-elementalistic term evaluation, which includes sensations-feelings-thoughts-behavior-environment, etc.; in other words, an organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment evaluational reaction (e.r.). (4) So, for me, our topic here is better phrased as Using General Semantics to Manage Evaluations. And what does managing evaluations refer to? I favor the phrase, effective self-management, the details of which are unique for each individual. For our purposes here, I suggest such goals as maintaining a relatively even keel when facing life's vicissitudes; maintaining meaningful relationships; contributing in positive ways to the larger community; having one or more deep interests to which time and effort is directed (could be work and/or hobbies, family, pets, etc.)--the details to be determined person-by-person. How to use general semantics to manage evaluations? Apply general semantics principles and techniques moment-to-moment! Study; consult the structural differential you have hanging on a wall (ahem); practice, practice, practice; etc., and again. Below you will find some examples of how you can do such applying and practicing; ways that I have found helpful both for my psychotherapy clients and myself. Recognize that any evaluation involves multiple causes associated with multiple effects, associated with multiple causes, etc. …",

      "title": "Touch in the Abstract",
      "abstract": "Touch in the Abstract Aden Evens (bio) One expresses oneself at the computer almost exclusively through the mouse and keyboard. Vision is nearly indispensable, and hearing plays a supporting role, but these senses are unusually constrained at the computer, as active input falls to the fingertips. At the computer, you express yourself, communicate your desires, by executing a gesture chosen from among a very few possibilities: you can click a key on the keyboard, move the mouse, or click the mouse. That’s it. Specialized speech-based interface augmentations are available; there are eye motion detectors and other alternative mouse-control techniques; touchscreens are proliferating in certain categories of device. But the great bulk of us continue to use the mouse and keyboard as our primary and even our only means of communicating desire to the computer. It is remarkable that so much desire gets expressed, such a breadth of different ideas passes through this restricted interface, fingertips against plastic. The interface evidently assigns the sense of touch a particular prominence in the expression of desire. What kind of desire gets expressed via touch, and what kind of touch touches the interface? The interface appears particularly narrow when it is recognized as a sequence of elementary commands: the expression of desire breaks down into individual keypresses and mouse clicks. Atomized, self-identical, and absolute, each keypress or mouse click is an abstraction; the k key generates not a particular, concrete k but only the selfsame, abstract command, k. (In general, interface components transduce between the material and the abstract. This is an appropriately vague definition of the interface: hardware and software that mediates between digital and actual or between abstract and material.) The job of mouse and keyboard is to render materiality as abstraction, just as the monitor and speakers take the abstraction of the digital code and present it to material sensation. A single click, the paradigmatic action at the interface, might involve hundreds of muscles, a finely tuned machine of flesh and nerve, plastic and silicon. But in the end, the mouse button is either pressed or not at any given instant of mouse clock time; nothing else matters at the computer. The materiality of the press becomes the abstract binarity of 0 or 1. The case of mouse movement is only slightly more complex: The now-standard optical mouse photographs images of the surface passing [End Page 67] underneath it. A differential analysis of successive images yields the mouse’s vector of motion. This differential mathematics is built into the mouse itself, housed on a chip designed specifically to perform these calculations. Motion (or stillness) of the mouse generates a pair of numbers, a horizontal velocity and a vertical velocity. Fifteen hundred times per second the mouse reports these numbers to the computer, passing them along through the USB bus (or over Bluetooth or whichever hardware standard is in use). The mouse cares not one bit about any other elements of touch. How hard you push, whether you’re sweaty, touch type or hunt-and-peck, the interface does not so much ignore as exclude these facets of touch, rendering touch abstract even before the CPU gets hold of the command. Which is to say, even the materiality of the mouse is coded by the binary; it’s as though the digital extends its effect by reaching out of the computer to determine the characteristics of its surroundings. The modern mouse takes photographs of the surface passing underneath it: an eighteen-by-eighteen pixilated grid, a snapshot taken so many times per second. Older opto-mechanical mice feature a mouse ball connected by gears to wheels inside the mouse, flat plates that turn along with the spinning of the mouse ball, one for forward-backward and one for left-right motion. The wheels have evenly spaced holes around their perimeters, admitting and interrupting a beam of light shining onto a sensor. The sensor reads a count per second of these interruptions to calculate the movement vector. (It must also include some mechanism for determining the direction of motion of each wheel, since the number of interruptions of the light beam indicates how rapidly but not in which...",

      "title": "A CLINICAL STUDY OF GILLES DE LA TOURETTE'S DISEASE (MALADIE DES TICS) IN CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "In his search of the literature for cases of a similar nature, Gilles de la Tourette was much impressed by reports of analogous syndromes in other cultures: \"latah,\" \"myriachit\" and \"jumping\"(13). \"The term latah conveys to the Malays a curious behavioral quirk, or aberration, normal, and yet not quite so.\"(14). The latah reaction consists of a severe startle reaction, imitative behavior, automatic obedience, and coprolalia. The victim is compelled \"against his will\"(15) to imitate the speech and behavior of others and to obey their commands, even though his tormentors clearly intend to degrade and ridicule him. He may even injure himself in the compulsion to mimic a self-destructive gesture only partially demonstrated by the person who \"teases\" him. For example, if the tormentor makes a sudden movement as if to place his hand in a fire, the latah victim may burn his own hand(16). \"Myriachit\" is the transliteration of a Russian word for an identical syndrome, one of a group classified as \"arctic hysteria\"(14, 16). The \"Jumpers\" of Maine, also known as \"Shakers\" or \"Barkers,\" were members of a deviant Methodist sect who practiced celibacy and communal living after their migration to New England(14). Church ceremonials reached a climax of religious ecstasy at which the members of the congregation would jump, shake, roll on the floor, or crawl about on all fours, all the while barking and emitting incoherent sounds (speaking in tongues). Those who participated in these ceremonials became prey to this behavior outside the church services. Members of this sect, examined by Beard in 1880(17), exhibited violent jumping and twisting movements when startled, echolalia, and echokinesis. Beard stated: \"All the Jumpers agree that it tires them to be jumped and they dread it, but they were constantly annoyed by their companions.\" It has been traditional in much of the medical literature to treat maladie des tics as though it were identical with latah and its cognate disorders. This is almost certainly incorrect. Tics, the earliest and often the most striking manifestations of Gilles de la Tourette's disease, are unknown in latah, whereas the imitation phenomena, which are the core of latah reactions, are often totally lacking in maladie des tics. The coprolalia in latah always follows provocation and is never perseverative. Latah reactions (with the significant exception of \"jumping\") are far more common in females, maladie des tics in males. Latah is never seen earlier than late adolescence. Sudden fright is consistently cited as its precipitating cause; startle reactions are prominent. When Aberle brought 3 persons familiar with latah reactions to see case #1 of this paper, they were unanimous in concluding that maladie des tics was clearly not the same as latah(16). Yap has suggested that latah reactions are a variant of traumatic or fear neurosis to be found in cultures with limited control over the physical environment(14). The etiology of Gilles de la Tourette's disease(2, 18-20) remains as obscure as it was in his time, though we may dismiss the notion of degeneracy, the catchall so fashionable in his day(1). Tics may be found in post-encephalitic conditions(21). They may accompany chorea, which may or may not be rheumatic in origin(22). They may be the symbolic crystallization of psychologic disturbances(23). Even when psychogenically induced, they may prove extremely refractory to psychotherapy(24, 25). Contrariwise, the organically grounded tic may be diminished, if not obliterated, by reduction in emotional tension. Consequently, arguments that reason from clinical phenomenology to hypotheses of origin must inevitably be inconclusive. The clinical manifestations of maladie des tics are responsive to the social environment, as our cases demonstrate; yet this in no sense constitutes proof of psychogenesis. An organic substratum may be nonetheless subject to modification or control by psychologic influences, since mental phenomena are brain events with electrical fields(26). In this connection, it is instructive to recall Efron's demonstration, in a patient with uncinate fits, that the mere recollection of odors and a conditioned visual image sufficed to inhibit the fits(27). In our experience, pharmacologic therapy, including sedatives, muscle relaxants, and tranquilizers, has been ineffective. At this stage of our knowledge, it would appear justified to continue efforts at psychotherapeutic management, despite Heuscher's admonition that the tic phenomena are defenses against an impending psychosis(20), and Mahler and Luke's warning that the release of aggressive and erotic material may \"weaken the controlling powers of the child ticquer\"(10). Very few of the cases reported in the literature have had a thorough trial of intensive psychologic treatment, still fewer in the early course of their disorder. At the least, psychotherapy may be of assistance to child and family in dealing with the social consequences of the illness. More hopefully, it may succeed in modifying the intrapsychic tensions that aggravate, if they do not cause, the symptoms. Several of our patients gave evidence of symptomatic improvement associated with psychologic treatment. The one patient with an apparently total recovery had the benefit of capably administered psychotherapy at two important junctures in his life. He had parents who, after psychiatric guidance, devoted their total efforts to his recovery. They were inclined to ascribe great value to home management with its concomitant descrease in social stimulation to the patient. It is not possible to say whether these factors or still other influences were instrumental in his recovery. Nonetheless, his gratifying response supports the wisdom of attempting total psychiatric management for patients with Gilles de la Tourette's disease.",

This is borne out by everyday clinical experience. A person may be at one moment conscious of one thing and at another moment conscious of another, but on each occasion he is equally conscious. Moreover, the content of consciousness may be impaired by disease, as when a patient loses part of a visual field or sensation over part of the body. Nevertheless, such a person remains fully conscious. On the other hand, a person may be completely unconscious, and between full consciousness and unconsciousness there are states in which he is partially conscious, that is, he has some degree of awareness of his surroundings, but it is incomplete.",

      "abstract": "Fulfilment of existential needs has been a top priority for human since its inception. Success in achieving this is conditioned by several different factors, which in different ways and with different consequences prevented people from fulfilling their needs. The result of the action of different forces was always the same, i.e. human suffered pain. Starting from natural disasters, which he did not understand, to other people who wanted to steal his prey, the environment became more and more dangerous. Joining different groups brought certain advantages in the field of joint action, against certain dangers, but at the same time new conditions of life and realization of life's needs. In social groups, new relationships were developing, which were driven by previously unknown forces, which represented new dangers. Therefore, human no longer had individual problems, but they were raised to the social level, and with that the level of complexity of mutual relations between people increased. Human is simply forced to protect his values in order to fulfil his needs. In order to realize this, he had to create an environment in which there is no danger, that is, a safe environment. The creation of such an environment was influenced by many factors, i.e., forces in nature and social groups. Emergency situations are a significant danger to modern society. Observed in terms of intensity or consequences, the hazards that cause them generate significant problems for society. The last decades of the 20th century are full of an increasing number of emergency situations, which significantly disrupt social security, at the local, regional and global level.",

For, in the course of my investigations into the philosophical literature concerning language, it came to light that in 1632, during the lifetime of Hobbes, Descartes, and Suarez, Jean Poinsot, the last philosopher, practically speaking, to hold the contrary of the above proposition up until Hegel/ was also able to demonstrate that what is at stake in this straightforward proposition is the possible convertibility of being and truth within the order of human understanding, and the successful culmination-through the systematic application to discourse of the contrast between the relative secundum dici and secundum esse-of the old medieval controversies over the \" transcendental \" properties of being, i. e., the properties whereby the order of the knowable includes indifferently objective elements of being and non-being so far as it falls under perception and conception. We are confronted here with a situation that is, as Jacques Maritain well remarked, \"puzzling to realize.\" 3 Even the most advanced professors and students of philosophy today are unlikely to have encountered the name of Jean Poinsot in the course of their researches and studies.4 The dis2 That is to say, the last proponent at the dawn of the national language phase of Western philosophy of the view that relations as such constitute precisely an intersubjective mode of being, existing according to what is proper to it neither as a subject nor in a subject, but as a suprasubjective means of union betweoo (tertium quid) a subject and some thing that subject is not. 8 \" It is puzzling to realize that the treasures contained in their writings \"-i.e., the writings of the commentators and defenders of St. Thomas, particularly, perhaps, in Iberia, between the 13th and the 17th centuries-\" have remained, for so many generations, unknown except to a very few....\" Jacques Maritain, letter to Yves Simon, printed as the \"Preface\" to The Material Logic of John of St. Thomas [i.e., Jean Poinsot] trans. by Yves R.

      "abstract": "Comments on the article by D. Nettle, who has clearly shown that evolutionary psychologists need to focus more attention on individual differences, not just species-typical universals. Such differences are not mere \"noise,\" and evolutionary theory will gain by understanding how they are produced and maintained. However, by focusing on personality traits and the five-factor personality model, Nettle left unaddressed many of the most important aspects of human personality. An evolutionary psychology of personality must ultimately explain not just trait differences but also differences in personal goals, values, motives, identities, and life narratives--essential elements of human individuality and functionality. K. M. Sheldon et al suggest four reasons why traits and the five-factor personality model do not provide an optimal approach for explaining the evolution of personality: (a) As constructs, traits provide little purchase for explaining the causes of behavior; (b) trait concepts do not acknowledge or explain people's variations around their own baselines, variations that are likely crucial for adaptation; (c) traits do not explain or even describe true human uniqueness, i.e. the ways in which a person is different from everybody else; and (d) traits do not explain personality from the inside, by considering what people are trying to do in their lives. In raising these issues Sheldon et al are suggesting that the important question for evolutionary personality study is not why people fall at different points on a continuum regarding traits x, y, and z, but rather why each person is inevitably unique while still sharing the same evolved psychology.",

      "abstract": "T F at some time a person's conduct can make -* the whole difference between probability = 0 and probability = 1 for the obtaining of some state of affairs S, then his conduct is relevant to (the obtaining of) S; or, as I shall sometimes say for short, he is relevant to S. One can also be rele? vant to S through affecting its probability less drastically than that. Everything I say here can take in that territory as well, but it is helpful to think mainly in terms of all-or-nothing relevance. A state of affairs may obtain (1) because some? body did such and such, or (2) because he did not do so and so. For example, the gate at the railway crossing was open (1) because he opened it, or (2) because he didn't close it. (2) doesn't apply unless he could have closed it: the Emperor of Japan didn't open the gate and couldn't have closed it, and so his conduct was not relevant at all to its being open. But I don't confine (2) to people who ought to have prevented S, or who had some duty or obligation to prevent it, or anything like that. I take someone's conduct to be negatively relevant to the gate's being open just so long as he could have closed it and didn't. That makes each of us negatively relevant to millions of states of affairs. But why not? I have been told: is not useful to make the notion of as weak as that. We should at least build into it that the person knew he could prevent S from obtaining. But if we do, we'll make some important truths harder to say, and thus harder to see. If I didn't know that I could have closed the gate, that may excuse me; and if I didn't know I was opening it, that may excuse me. It won't be easy to compare those two excuses if we work with a concept of ac? cording to which a person is not negatively rele? vant to S unless he does know what his conduct is leading to. It may be objected that the ignorance excuse falls very unevenly across the positive/neg? ative divide, being available a million times on the side for every one on the positive. But that doesn't mean that comparisons are not worth making; and in any case, you can't even state that objection without using negative relevance in my way. If we refuse to call someone's conduct negatively relevant to S unless he knew that he could make the difference to whether S obtained or not, we shall be definitionally abolishing the ex? cuse He was negatively relevant, but he didn't know, stamping into the ground an interesting and perhaps important difference between the two sorts of relevance. Similarly for the suggestion that we shouldn't call someone negatively relevant to S's obtaining unless it was his job to prevent it. We ought to be able to compare how the plea was not his spe? cial responsibility works on the side of the line with how it works on the positive side; but for that we need a concept of which allows the plea to arise on that side of the line.",

      "abstract": "Animals communicate, but only humans communicate through language. The distinctive feature of language is that words carry meanings, which we learn initially through socialization and education. Communication through language depends upon these meanings being sheared. We also communicate in many non-verbal ways, through, for example, body-language, but the same processes of attaching and learning meaning apply. Thus, we learn that the \"thumbs up\" sign means that \"things are OK\". We communicate through images, too. A holiday snap can communicate our well-being on holiday and inform people that we have visited a fashionable resort. The term \"image\" has been extended to mean not just a representation of something, but also the impression of ourselves that we communicate to other people. We create an image through the style we adopt, and the clothes that we wear communicate a great deal about us. These non-verbal ways of communication carry learned and sheared meanings and may also be considered languages of a kind. Languages are much more than a means of communication, for they also express and shape the way that we see the world and the way that we see ourselves.",

Appropriate interventions differ for each aspect of the body: for the body as social symbol, programs such as Look Good ...

Today, the same discipline holds both ideas to be false and posits the very opposite: animals of some species are capable of insight – they can recognise themselves in a mirror and exhibit at least a basic sense of self-awareness – and they have rich emotional lives that seem to be startlingly similar to those of humans. Situations that lead to strong emotional responses in humans, whether positive or negative – for example, when we fall in love or lose a partner – seem to have the same effect on our animal relatives.",

Yet, this would be all but a complete picture. It is in fact possible to think of well-being as a far more complex phenomenon: something other than comforting and fleeting emotions, and different from mere individual feelings of joy or vitality. Well-being may be considered first and foremost as a social issue, pertaining to the composition of conflicting values and the fulfilment of collective needs. All the more so, against the background of global phenomena such as climate change and economic inequality, well-being cannot be reduced to a patchwork of good emotions or to the absence of disease or social unrest.

Fear and anxiety cause stress which could lead to chronic stress. Dogs that suffer from fear-related problems are often euthanized or abandoned. Dogs with fear-related aggression could be potentially dangerous to humans since the fear triggers an aggressive response which might cause the dog to bite. Fear is an adaptive response that increases the survival of a species and results in a physical and physiological response that prepares the individual for fight or flight. However, when this behaviour is generalised and/or triggered too easily and/or is expressed intensively, it usually becomes problematic for the dog, humans and society.\r\nFear-related aggression occurs when the dog encounters a problem stimulus which it cannot avoid. Fear-related aggression is often misinterpreted as protective aggression, e.g. that the dog wants to protect its owner. In reality, the dog is frightened and wants to defend itself from danger. Dogs could show signs of fear-related aggression by snarling, snapping or biting.\r\nDogs with noise phobia are commonly afraid of thunder, fireworks and/or gunshots. Fear of noises and thunderstorms tend to escalate, i.e. worsening with each exposure. A dog with a fear of gunshots might eventually become fearful of similar sounds or events associated with the noise (generalised fear). Panting, shaking or flight attempts could be signs of noise phobia.\r\nSeparation-related behaviour occurs when the dog is separated from the owner. It could be caused by a lack of habituation to being alone. Destructive behaviour, vocalisation or hyperactivity are some signs of separation-related disorders.\r\nBehaviour therapy, changes in the environment and medication are common methods for treatment of fear-related aggression, noise phobia and separation-related disorders, the effects of these treatments are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Encounters with animals are common in video games, where they are often included to add realism to the gameworld. Encounters with animal subjectivity, however, are not. The anthropocentric nature of video games means that animals are often environmental objects, and sometimes resources, but only occasionally characters, and rarely protagonists. As a consequence, there is no encounter with the animal presence, and often no shared gaze: The look of the animal is instead transformed into something wholly antagonistic (such as in Horizon Zero Dawn), wholly submissive (as in Far Cry Primal) or absent entirely (Red Dead Redemption). Even when video game animals are designed with the intention of “appreciating” the animals, the privileging of their panoptic human spectators just as often results in their objectification.",

      "abstract": "The question of how and why organisms adapt to their environments has long fascinated the minds of men. Whether the organism is a single cell, an individual, a small group, or a large aggregate of people, its struggle both to use and to withstand its environment is filled with drama. The environment is constantly changing and, as a result, it always poses a threat to the integrity and survival of the organism. Can the organism adjust to the changes? Can it take advantage of them and prosper? Or will it succumb to them and disappear into its environment? If it is able to remain distinct from its environment, what price will the organism have to pay for its survival? Will radical alterations have to occur in its own internal structure, or can the demands of the environment be readily absorbed and adaptation smoothly accomplished? Such questions are fascinating partly because the survival of the organism can never be taken for granted and its struggles thus attract attention, partly because the questions evoke feelings about the dignity of life and thus command sympathy, and partly because the answers to them are not easily acquired and thus arouse curiosity and tax the imagination.",

      "abstract": "In this book, Michael Plaxton advocates for expansion of the legal definition of ''sexual consent'' to include ''implied consent.'' 1 Like Don Stuart 2 and Edward Greenspan, 3 he is troubled by the effects of the legal definition of sexual consent, in particular, by its potential to deem what Plaxton characterizes as ''innocent'' or ''morally'' non-culpable physical contact between intimates as ''criminal''-a result Plaxton describes as ''counter-intuitive.''Examples offered of ''innocent,'' albeit non-consensual (no contemporaneous agreement) and therefore ''criminal'' conduct, include touching the other party in public (caressing her knee under a restaurant table) or private (the impromptu surprise ''embrace'' or the kiss while she sleeps).These examples, Plaxton suggests, show that ordinary acts of intimacy between parties in accordance with normative arrangements and practices established by them are not criminal acts and should not to be labelled as ''crimes.'' 4 Plaxton therefore proposes that the definition of ''sexual consent'' as ''voluntary agreement to participate in the sexual activity in question,'' as codified by Parliament in 1992 and first construed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v Ewanchuk in 1999, be amended to recognize a role for ''implied consent.'' 5He expressly limits his focus to sexual activity between heterosexual individuals and presumes the male to be the socially dominant party, the female the ''consenting'' party and the potential complainant.Economic equality is assumed, and issues arising from intersectionality are not addressed.Plaxton claims that recognition of the validity of ''implied consent'' would advance the equality rights of women by affording them a fuller measure of sexual autonomy free from the state enacted and judicially CJWL/RFD",

      "title": "Altered States of Consciousness Occurring During Expanded Sexual Response In The Human Female: Preliminary Definitions",
      "abstract": "Expanded Sexual Response (ESR) is a recently defined phenomenon. It is defined as “being able to attain long lasting and/or prolonged and/or multiple and/or sustained orgasms and/or status orgasmus that lasted longer and more intense than the classical orgasm patterns defined in the literature”. During our detailed preliminary survey to investigate the claimed ESR phenomenon in some particular women, we also investigated the subjective feelings and altered states of consciousness (ASC) during very intense and prolonged orgasms in the women with ESR. During our preliminary survey 72 types of different subjective feelings and ASC patterns were described in the 47 women with ESR. Among these were: depersonalization; out of body experience; flying; dying feeling (petit morte); ecstasy; rapture; explosion feeling; quivering, earthquake feeling; flooding; absorbing; spurting; blessed; shuddering; intense love; unreal; surreal; voyage to nature; seeing light flashes, color flashes, geometric shapes, figures; peacefulness; physical and spiritual warmth; loss of control; spreading; flowing; mystical experience; unification with the partner and/or the universe; de ja vu; crying etc. It is concluded that in some particular women with ESR, some of the very intense and prolonged orgasms induce a form of ASC of which mechanism is not explained yet! Pudental, pelvic, hypogastric and vagus nerves and oxytocin pathway is involved in the development of female orgasm. We hypothesize that blended nerve activation among these four nerves during ESR may be inducing extraordinary subjective feelings and ASC during profound female orgasms. “Four nerve and six pathway theory of female orgasm” may explain the ASC during ESR to some extent. Also involvement of dopaminergic, serotoninergic, noradrenergic, opioid, prolactinergic and oxytocinergic pathways may modulate the altered mood states during ESR induced ASCs. More research to determine the scientific basis and parameters of ESR phenomenon in some females should be carried out, as well as the research on the neurological, psychological and neurochemical mechanisms of ESR induced ASC’s in some females’ psyche.",

Serendipity deals with grasping affordances, that is, usage potentials, creating correspondence and resonance between environmental and personal factors. Serendipity thus plays a fundamental role in how we discover, explore, and learn, and are creative, in all fields of life; on a continuum from grand discoveries in science (like penicillin) to small curiosity insights and informal learnings we all make in everyday-life micro-serendipity [http://hdl.handle.net/2142/36052]. In line with my poem here on Chance + Choice + Change, I see serendipity as a control clash between perceived non-control (Chance) and perceived control (Choice), often leading to Change in our perceptions and directions in life. Serendipity leading to such changes in scientific knowledge as well as in our everyday life is the result of discovering and grasping so-called adjacent possibilities that are both available and new to us in a given situation [https://www.academia.edu/71056287/Adjacent_possible].

      "abstract": "AI needs a formal functional theory of emotions to represent in computer programs our knowledge of emotions. In the theory we propose, emotions are a special class of Intentional states with structural components and properties similar to thos e of the traditional somatic appetites of thirst, hunger, and sex. These were originally part of a hardwired, phylogenetically adapted, nonverbal feedback system for implicitly conveying information about these states both among and within individual members of the species. A classification system provides two major functional classes of emotions, (1) those serving as Appetitive Wishes toward objects, and (2) those serving as Beliefs about the status of fulfillment of those and other significant wishes. Thus, emotions such as Anger or Fear indicate a wish to attack or escape from some object or situation, while Love or Surprise indicate wishes to care about or explore an object or situation. Emotional wishes, like their somatic brethren, require Consummatory Acts for their fulfillment. The result of these acts are emotions such Anxiety or Depression, which indicate Beliefs that the relevant wishes will be hard or impossible to satisfy, or Contentment or Elation , which function as Beliefs that the wishes have been or are being fulfilled. Together, emotional wishes and beliefs form a comprehensive wish-belief information feedback system with manifold causal consequences. Potential applications include agent-oriented problem solving, animation, and human-computer interaction.",

      "abstract": "This work engages with a longstanding problem of East-West cultural difference: the different conceptions of anatomy and biology between modern scientific/'Western' medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. To do so, the work focuses on only one example of difference: the Chinese notion of the dantian (丹田). This is not present in Western anatomy or biology. So, the question arises as to its objective existence: If Western science cannot detect it, what does it mean to say that it exists? Must a Westerner who has no prior exposure to such a notion believe in the dantian? What is the status of this belief? Many approaches to such questions turn to debates in phenomenology, epistemology, translation and religious studies. However, this work instead proposes a more direct way to proceed. It proposes that such differences arise and can helpfully be understood in terms of the specific sensory maps and fields of the body that are developed by specific exercises, disciplines, or training regimes (what philosopher Peter Sloterdijk calls anthropotechnic practices).",

      "abstract": "Background: In the joints, the movements, active or passive, occur normally in certain physiological planes: axes or directions, and within certain limits. In certain pathologies, the joint kinematics may be affected in one of the following ways: limitation of the normal movements, movement beyond the normal limits, or movement in the non-physiological planes. Different terms were used to describe the abnormalities of the joint kinematics. Nowadays, terms like joint hypermobility, joint laxity, joint instability, and ligamentous laxity are, synonymously or not, still used in some literature in their correct place. The current article aimed to review the abnormalities of joint kinematics and the new concepts of optimum application of the terms used to describe them. It has reached to some conclusions like: limitation of joint movement is the term used to describe any incomplete joint movement within a physiological plane and standard limits; Joint hypermobility is the term used to describe the ability to do a joint movement in a physiological plane but beyond the usual limits. Joint instability is the term used to describe the liability of a joint to move in non-physiological planes.",

All transitive verbs have a patient. Verbs (denoting actions) of the whole body can be divided into two groups: transitive and intransitive. Intransitive verbs are, for example, (those that belong to the lexical classes of) 'sitting' and 'standing'. If one intends to make an intransitive verb transitive, one can do it in a number of ways. The first is transitivisation by means of a particle. The second is (transitivisation) by means of a pataḥ.

      "title": "Gestures as image schemas and force gestalts: A dynamic systems approach augmented with motion-capture data analyses",
      "abstract": "Abstract Embodied image schemas are central to experientialist accounts of meaning-making. Research from several disciplines has evidenced their pervasiveness in motivating form and meaning in both literal and figurative expressions across diverse semiotic systems and art forms (e.g., Gibbs and Colston; Hampe; Johnson; Lakoff; and Mandler). This paper aims to highlight structural similarities between, on the one hand, dynamic image schemas and force schemas and, on the other, hand shapes and gestural movements. Such flexible correspondences between conceptual and gestural schematicity are assumed to partly stem from experiential bases shared by incrementally internalized conceptual structures and the repeated gestural (re-) enacting of bodily actions as well as more abstract semantic primitives (Lakoff). Gestures typically consist of evanescent, metonymically reduced hand configurations, motion onsets, or movement traces that minimally suggest, for instance, a PATH, the idea of CONTAINMENT, an IN-OUT spatial relation, or the momentary loss of emotional BALANCE. So, while physical in nature, gestures often emerge as rather schematic gestalts that, as such, have the capacity to vividly convey essential semantic and pragmatic aspects of high relevance to the speaker. It is further argued that gesturally instantiated image schemas and force dynamics are inherently meaningful structures that typically underlie more complex semantic and pragmatic processes involving, for instance, metonymy, metaphor, and frames. First, I discuss previous work on how image schemas, force gestalts, and mimetic schemas may underpin hand gestures and body postures. Drawing on Gibbs’ dynamic systems account of image schemas, I then introduce an array of tendencies in gestural image schema enactments: body-inherent/self-oriented (body as image-schematic structure; forces acting upon the body); environment-oriented (material culture including spatial structures), and interlocutor-oriented (intersubjective understanding). Adopting a dynamic systems perspective (e.g.,Thompson and Varela) thus puts the focus on how image schemas and force gestalts that operate in gesture may function as cognitive-semiotic organizing principles that underpin a) the physical and cognitive self-regulation of speakers; b) how they interact with the (virtual) environment while talking; and c) intersubjective instances of resonance and understanding between interlocutors or between an artwork and its beholder. Examples of these patterns are enriched by video and motion-capture data, showing how numeric kinetic data allow one to measure the temporal and spatial dimensions of gestural articulations and to visualize movement traces.",

To start with, emotions are not the same as feelings, I think a lot of confusion arises because people talk about feelings and emotions synonymously. Emotions are unseen activities. Love, for instance, or hate—both or either of these are unseen. You may see all sorts of signs of them, but they are activities; but you will feel them if you walk into a room and someone who is exceedingly hateful and hostile is there—you will feel that, most likely. When you try to describe it——ay, someone says, \"Why do you dislike that person so much?\" and you say, \"Oh, well, you know, when I arrived he didn't open the door and he turned the other way, or he scowled when I was talking to him.\" These are all attempts, but they are not actually quite the reason. It is because the emotion itself is like an unseen action that can be registered in the feelings.",

      "title": "Semantic and discourse constraints on Chinese Bei-passives",
      "abstract": "The semantic function of the ? bei passive sentence has been characterized in various ways. It has been claimed by some scholars that its primary function is to indicate that the referent of the subject, the speaker or the hearer is adversely affected by the action, event or state represented in the sentence. It has also been claimed that the construction can sometimes be used neutrally, without any adversity implications. It has further been claimed that it can sometimes be used with positive implications. But little attempt has been made in the past to show exactly when the construction acquires which of these three implications (i.e., adversative, neutral, and positive). This paper attempts to answer that question. It proposes that the semantic/discourse function of the bei-passive sentence is to indicate that the referent of the subject, the speaker (or the person whose point of view (s)he is representing) or the hearer receives a major impact which is above a certain threshold from the action, event, or state represented in the sentence. The impact can be either direct, as is the case with high-impact verbs (e.g., ? da ‘hit’, ?? kaichu ‘fire’), indirect (as is the case with low or no impact verbs such as ?? kanjian ‘see’, ? hen ‘hate’), or both. It shows that a generalization that is based on ‘EITHER a major direct impact OR a major indirect impact’ does not work. It proposes that the semantic/discourse function of the bei-passive sentence is to indicate that the SUM of the direct and indirect impacts that the referent of the subject, the speaker (or the person whose point of view (s)he is representing) or the hearer receives is at or above the threshold for a major impact.",

      "title": "Tutorial 1-3: Leader Election and Pattern Formation in Swarms of Deterministic Robots",
      "abstract": "In a given environment, the ability for the swarm of robots to succeed in the accomplishment of the assigned task greatly depends on global properties assigned to the swarm, and individual capabilities each robot has. Examples of such global properties are the ability to distinguish among themselves at least one (or, more) robots (leader), to agree on a common global direction (sense of direction), or to agree on a common handedness (chirality). The individual capacities of each robot are its moving capabilities and its sensory organs. To deal with cost, flexibility, resilience to dysfunction, and autonomy, many problems arise for handling the distributed coordination of swarms of robots in a deterministic manner. This issue is motivated by the minimal level of ability that the robots are required to have in the accomplishment of basic cooperative tasks. In other words, the feasibility of some given tasks is addressed assuming swarm of autonomous robots either devoid or not of capabilities like (observable) identifiers, direct means of communication, means of storing previous observations, sense of direction, chirality, etc. Leader election and arbitrary pattern formation are fundamental tasks for a set of autonomous mobile robots. The former consists in moving the system from an initial configuration were all entities are in the same state into a final configuration were all entities are in the same state, except one, the leader. The latter consists in the design of protocols allowing autonomous mobile robots to form any (arbitrary) geometric pattern. The solvability of both these tasks turns out to be necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. During this tutorial, we address both problems. We first consider the deterministic solvability of the pattern formation problem assuming swarms of anonymous robots. Next, under the same assumptions, we provide a complete characterization (necessary and sufficient conditions) on the robots positions to deterministically elect a leader. Finally, we show that Leader Election and Pattern Formation are two equivalent problems in the precise sense that, the former is solvable if and only if the latter problem is solvable.",

The immediate cause of stammering is lack of co-ordination between mind and body, as anxiety makes the mind race ahead of the speech and think about everything which has to be said, in an effort to predict problems in saying forthcoming words. Stammering has a tremendous emotional impact upon a person's life, because the debilitated speech severely restricts freedom of communication. Stammering is a faulty and incorrect mode of speech, which lacks shape, form and continuity. The stammerer is constantly trying to avoid stammering in speaking situations, attempting to transfer the information required with the least amount of stammering possible. Many stammerers have for one reason or another the fixed notion that their stammer cannot be cured and resign themselves to a life of stammering.",

      "title": "THE NATURE AND ANTECEDENTS OF VIOLENT EVENTS",
      "abstract": "VIOLENT events form very important parts of those marital or cohabiting relationships in which they occur. 1They usually take place after a build-up and take on an identity of their own which is intense and memorable because of the type and level of activity involved and because of the meanings they have for each partner.Such events may assume an importance that not only dominates the daily lives of both abuser and abused but also forms a crucial part in the formation of subsequent violent events and in the continuing development of the couple's overall relationship.As such it is important to have a better understanding of this dynamic process, including information about the event itself, the circumstances surrounding it, the meanings and motives involved and the changes that occur over time.Gaining a more thorough understanding requires an examination of at least three important facets of the violent event: its concrete nature, its dynamic development and its location within the wider social context.The nature of the event includes the major elements of which it is composed, such as sources of conflict, arguments, physical attack, injuries, time, location and the reactions of third parties.Dynamic development includes the unfolding of the event from the beginning to the end.In a wider sense, it also includes the unfolding of the process through which the violent relationship progresses over time from the emergence of the violence through its continuation and, for some, its eventual termination either through escape from the abuser or cessation of his violent behaviour.Locating this dynamic process in its wider social context involves relating it to the structure of the relationships between men and women in marriage, the family, the economy and the socio-legal system.This context provides the backdrop against which the motivations of the participants and the meanings attached to the event, as well as the responses of third parties, can best be understood and explained.The primary purpose of this paper is to examine in some detail the concrete nature of violent events that occur between men and women living in a marital or cohabiting relationship and to examine changes that occur in this event throughout the relationship.

      "title": "The Value of Judgments Regarding the Value of Animals",
      "abstract": "Contemporary skepticism concerning the mental within philosophy of mind and psychology certainly seems to have created hard times for ethics. Eliminative materialists like Stich (1983) attack the very foundation on which moral theories are based. Since moral theories assume a certain amount of intentionality as a building block for their legislation ofrights and obligations, any positions that could demonstrate in some form that such an assumption is unwarranted, in that beliefs, desires and mental states in general cannot be shown to exist, would seem to spell death for the ethical realm. Ifmoral theories require realism about cognitive elements and their states yet are unable to present us with the evidence that will support this requirement, then they must either give up this requirement, and accept the view that moral agents and subjects no longer have any sure footing with regard to their claims concerning moral behavior toward themselves and others, or recognize some other way on which to ground their views. Does it have to be the case, for instance, that consciousness and sentience are the only conditions on which moral status can be ascribed to beings? Or can we refer to some other condition or set of conditions? Can we perhaps expand our concept of morality to include animals yet without necessarily raising the problems associated with attributions of intentionality? The general focus of this paper, then, concerns my interest in the conditions that make moral judgments about animals true. Hence, I am concerned with moral epistemology, not axiology. In Part I, I present a cursory analysis of Stich's view concerning ascriptions of beliefs to humans as well as to animals. In Part II, I analyze Regan's arguments for why certain animals ought to be regarded as moral subjects as well as his response to Stich's position. My intention behind presenting Regan's position is twofold: (1) to show that Stich's position creates some difficulty for Regan's ultimate goal of ascribing rights to animals and (2) to point out that the comparison of animal to human belief structures is not an effective way to ground what possible claims they may have against us. I conclude on a somewhat Heideggarian note in Part III. I argue that animals and nature itself may be deserving of some moral recognition just by virtue of the fact that they afford us possibilities with respect to what we can and do become. Value, in a certain sense, is to be found external to ourselves.",

      "abstract": "The language of cinema is often used to speak about a dream, either because cinema and psychoanalysis were born at the same time, or, rather, because the position of the spectator, passive in the dark and concentrating on the movements of images is not very far from the dreamer’s position. Such approximations make us forget everything that the introduction of a dream sequence – fiction within fiction (a fictional character makes a fictional dream) – brings to the film’s progress. In cinema, the dream has three main functions. It sometimes is an event that influences a character, troubling him or revealing something about him. It also is, in certain cases, an autonomous segment, a sort of parenthesis in the middle of the projection. It finally helps to show unusual images, with a very fast or slow editing, which break the predictable progress of the story. These functions do not exist by themselves; they depend on the strategy of enunciation, that is to say on the way the film implicates the spectator, by warning him (a character falls asleep) that he is going to watch a dream, or by letting him uncertain. Beyond a relative analogy, one must not forget that a film, unlike a dream, is a rhetorical piece of work.",

      "abstract": "The focus of this paper is the requirement that the use of live animals in experiments and in vivo assays should never be allowed if those uses involve severe suffering. This requirement was first implemented in Danish legislation, was later adopted by the European Union, and has had limited uptake in North America. Animal suffering can arise from exposure to a wide range of different external and internal events that threaten biological or social functions, while the severity of suffering may be influenced by the animals' perceptions of their own situation and the degree of control they are able to exert. Severe suffering is more than an incremental increase in negative state(s) but involves a qualitative shift whereby the normal mechanisms to contain or keep negative states at arm's length no longer function. The result of severe suffering will be a loss of the ability of cope. The idea of putting a cap on severe suffering may be justified from multiple ethical perspectives. In most, if not all, cases it is possible to avoid imposing severe suffering on animals during experiments without giving up the potential benefits of finding new ways to cure, prevent, or alleviate serious human diseases and generate other important knowledge. From this it follows that there is a strong ethical case to favor a regulatory ban on animal experiments involving severe suffering.",

Exactly through inactivity, the internal will of a person materializes due to which a person becomes a participant of public relations. At the same time in the absence of external expression of will inactivity of a person can not cause the occurrence of legal consequences, in particular, to be examined as a reason of origin of tort liabilities. If a person enacted because of negligence or poor awareness, it should be defined: whether a person knew or had to know about the necessity to perform a certain action. Accordingly, if a person possessed such knowledge this form of behavior will be treated as guilty omission, if not – this is an example of innocent omission. Responsibility for illegal omission can arise only when appropriate persons are included in the system of civil and legal relationships, thus are the subjects of civil relations. Damage caused by “reflexive movements” testifies the carelessness of a person to his/her behavior, which reflects his/her will. Therefore, such behavior of a person is considered to be wrongful.",

      "title": "Some multimodal signals in humans",
      "abstract": "In this paper, I will give an overview of some well-studied multimodal signals that humans produce while they communicate with other humans, and discuss the implications of those studies for HCI. I will first discuss a conceptual framework that allows us to distinguish between functional and sensory modalities. This distinction is important, as there are multiple functional modalities using the same sensory modality (e.g., facial expression and eye-gaze in the visual modality). A second theoretically important issue is redundancy. Some signals appear to be redundant with a signal in another modality, whereas others give new information or even appear to give conflicting information (see e.g., the work of Susan Goldin-Meadows on speech accompanying gestures). I will argue that multimodal signals are never truly redundant. First, many gestures that appear at first sight to express the same meaning as the accompanying speech generally provide extra (analog) information about manner, path, etc. Second, the simple fact that the same information is expressed in more than one modality is itself a communicative signal. Armed with this conceptual background, I will then proceed to give an overview of some multimodal signals that have been investigated in human-human research, and the level of understanding we have of the meaning of those signals. The latter issue is especially important for potential implementations of these signals in artificial agents. First, I will discuss pointing gestures. I will address the issue of the timing of pointing gestures relative to the speech it is supposed to support, the mutual dependency between pointing gestures and speech, and discuss the existence of alternative ways of pointing from other cultures. The most frequent form of pointing that does not involve the index finger is a cultural practice called lip-pointing which employs two visual functional modalities, mouth-shape and eye-gaze, simultaneously for pointing. Next, I will address the issue of eye-gaze. A classical study by Kendon (1967) claims that there is a systematic relationship between eye-gaze (at the interlocutor) and turn-taking states. Research at our institute has shown that this relationship is weaker than has often been assumed. If the dialogue setting contains a visible object that is relevant to the dialogue (e.g., a map), the rate of eye-gaze-at-other drops dramatically and its relationship to turn taking disappears completely. The implications for machine generated eye-gaze are discussed. Finally, I will explore a theoretical debate regarding spontaneous gestures. It has often been claimed that the class of gestures that is called iconic by McNeill (1992) are a “window into the mind”. That is, they are claimed to give the researcher (or even the interlocutor) a direct view into the speaker’s thought, without being obscured by the complex transformation that take place when transforming a thought into a verbal utterance. I will argue that this is an illusion. Gestures can be shown to be specifically designed such that the listener can be expected to interpret them. Although the transformations carried out to express a thought in gesture are indeed (partly) different from the corresponding transformations for speech, they are a) complex, and b) severely understudied. This obviously has consequences both for the gesture research agenda, and for the generation of iconic gestures by machines.",

      "abstract": "The majority of organisms on Earth learn little or nothing during their individual lifetimes. On the other hand, many mammals are born in a highly immature state and so they must individually learn things crucial for their survival. In order to 1⁄2nd food reliably, youngsters of foraging species must learn the spatial layouts of their local environments. In order to distinguish friends from enemies, youngsters of social species must learn to recognize the individuals who make up their social groups. For several decades, behaviorists attempted to 1⁄2nd the laws of learning that applied equally to all species, for any and all tasks, and that did not involve to any signi1⁄2cant degree processes of cognition. But the modern view that learning assumes diverse forms in different species and behavioral domains, and operates in concert with cognitive processes that may be speci1⁄2c to particular species or domains, has for the most part suspended that search. For social species such as humans and other mammals, an especially important form of learning is social learning. Observing the activities of others and learning about the world from or through them enables individuals to acquire information with less effort and risk than if they were forced to learn on their own. For instance, many species of rats learn which foods to eat and which to avoid by observing what other rats eat and then seeing what happens to them subsequently–clearly a safer strategy than always trying out new foods for oneself.1 Despite an overall similarity in the function of learning in the lives of different species of mammals, social learning, like individual learning, comes in many different forms. In our empirical work over the past 1⁄2fteen years, we have investigated forms of social learning that",

Babies even exhibit signs that are interpreted as anger, such as crying or screaming. Anger is not in any way unique to people. Animals also have the ability to feel and express anger. In our personal lives we get angry over at least one thing on almost a daily basis, whether it is on thejob, with a spouse or loved one, or perhaps with a figure of authority. Anger is a healthy emotion when it is expressed appropriately. When it is not, it can have devastating effects. Anger is at the root of many personal and social problems, e.g. child abuse, domestic violence, physical and verbal abuse and community violence etc. Problematic interpersonal relations may also disrupt employment activities because of the interference of anger on workplace performance. Anger can destroy relationships, obstruct problem solving skills, and increase social withdrawal. Anger also affects our physical health. For example, it can tax our immune system; contribute to headaches, migraines, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Anger is a healthy and valid emotion. But many of us are taught not to express or show our anger. There's no doubt about it: we live in an angry society. Signs that anger abounds are all over the place. There is desk rage, road rage, spousal abuse, sports rage and most recently spam rage. Anger is a worldwide phenomenon and referrals to anger management programs have exploded since.

Polysemy lets a limited vocabulary capture a great variety of experiences, while highlighting commonalities. But how is this achieved? Are polysemous senses contextually driven modifications of core meanings, or must each sense be memorized separately? We show that participants’ ability to avoid referentially ambiguous descriptions of pictures named by polysemous words provides evidence for both possibilities. When senses followed a regular pattern (e.g., animals and the foodstuffs derived from them; noisy chicken, tasty chicken), participants avoided using ambiguous labels in referentially ambiguous situations (e.g., both types of chicken were present), a result indicating that they noticed a common meaning. But when senses were idiosyncratically related (e.g., sheet of glass, drinking glass), participants frequently produced ambiguous labels, a result indicating that the meanings were separately stored.

      "title": "How animals collaborate: Underlying proximate mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Abstract Collaboration or social interactions in which two or more individuals coordinate their behavior to produce outcomes from which both individuals benefit are common in nature. Individuals from many species hunt together, defend their territory, and form coalitions in intragroup competition. However, we still know very little about the proximate mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Recent theories of human cognitive evolution have emphasized the role collaboration may have played in the selection of socio‐cognitive skills. It has been argued that the capacity to form shared goals and joint intentions with others, is what allows humans to collaborate so flexibly and efficiently. Although there is no evidence that nonhuman animals are capable of shared intentionality, there is conceivably a wide range of proximate mechanisms that support forms of, potentially flexible, collaboration in other species. We review the experimental literature with the aim of evaluating what we know about how other species achieve collaboration; with a particular focus on chimpanzees. We structure the review with a new categorization of collaborative behavior that focuses on whether individuals intentionally coordinate actions with others. We conclude that for a wider comparative perspective we need more data from other species but the findings so far suggest that chimpanzees, and possibly other great apes, are capable of understanding the causal role of a partner in collaboration.

      "abstract": "When interacting with humans, robotic systems shall behave in compliance to some of our socio-cultural rules, and every component of the robot have to take them into account. When deciding an action to perform and how to perform it, the system then needs to communicate pertinent contextual information to its components so they can plan respecting these rules. It is also essential for such robot to ensure a smooth coordination with its human partners. We humans use many cues for synchronization like gaze, legible motions or speech. We are good at inferring what actions are available to our partner, helping us to get an idea of what others are going to do (or what they should do) to better plan for our own actions. Enabling the robot with such capacities is key in the domain of human-robot interaction. This thesis presents our approach to solve two tasks where humans and robots collaborate deeply: a transport problem where multiple robots and humans need to or can handover an object to bring it from one place to another, and a guiding task where the robot helps the humans to orient themselves using speech, navigation and deictic gestures (pointing). We present our implementation of components and their articulation in a architecture where contextual information is transmitted from higher levels decision components to lower ones, which use it to adapt. Our planners also plan for the human actions, as in a multi-robot system: this allows to not be waiting for humans to act, but rather be proactive in the proposal of a solution, and try to predict the actions they will take.",

      "title": "Into the darkness: Losing identity with dementia1,2",
      "abstract": "Abstract That some sort of personal identity is lost when dementias ravage the brain seems indisputable. But what kind of identity is lost and what unchanged aspect of the person other than the endurance of the body, might—at least for a time—be retained? One short answer lies in philosophical traditions deriving from Locke's discussion, wherein personal identity depends on the very memory whose failure is a harbinger of dementia: from the onset of the disease, on such an account, identity disappears. Personal and self-identity are complex, multi-stranded concepts, however, which show up in many different discourses. This is particularly evident in English-language writing on the identity of persons, which has undergone a sea change in the last 15 or 20 years. Such writing now reveals greater acknowledgement of Continental European traditions and reflects emotional valences absent from previous discussions. Our guiding presumption here is that there are several ways of talking about identity—so when some forms of identity are eroded through dementia, other forms may yet be ascribed. These more enduring aspects of identity, it is our hope, can illuminate certain ethical quandaries over how to feel about and respond to those suffering from the conditions that cause dementia.In Part 1, we introduce some variations on traditional discussions of identity and personal identity from Leibniz and Locke, respectively. These variations include Paul Ricoeur's contrast between ipse and idem identity and aspects of one loose but influential sense of identity informing present day identity politics. In Part 2, we explore the implications of these alternative conceptions of identity in relation to dementia and to some of the ethically troubling questions it raises.",

      "title": "Implicit measures of anthropomorphism: affective priming and recognition of apparent animal emotions",
      "abstract": "It has long been recognized that humans tend to anthropomorphize. That is, we naturally and effortlessly interpret the behaviors of nonhuman agents in the same way we interpret human behaviors. This tendency has only recently become a subject of empirical research. Most of this work uses explicit measures. Participants are asked whether they attribute some human-like trait to a nonhuman agent on some scale. These measures, however, have two limitations. First, they do not capture automatic components of anthropomorphism. Second, they generally only track one anthropomorphic result: the attribution (or non-attribution) of a particular trait. However, anthropomorphism can affect how we interpret animal behavior in other ways as well. For example, the grin of a nonhuman primate often looks to us like a smile, but it actually signals a state more like fear or anxiety. In the present work, we tested for implicit components of anthropomorphism based on an affective priming paradigm. Previous work suggests that priming with human faces displaying emotional expressions facilitated categorization of words into congruent emotion categories. In Experiments 1–3, we primed participants with images of nonhuman animals that appear to express happy or sad emotions, and asked participants to categorize words as positive or negative. Experiment 4 used human faces as control. Overall, we found consistent priming congruency effects in accuracy but not response time. These appeared to be more robust in older adults. They also appear to emerge with more processing time, and the pattern was the same with human as with primate faces. This demonstrates a role for automatic processes of emotion recognition in anthropomorphism. It also provides a potential measure for further exploration of implicit anthropomorphism.",

Assumed similarity affects judgments of well-acquainted others and strangers alike, and it is apparent for a great variety of traits, attitudes, and behaviors. Most robust assumed similarity effects are, however, apparent for characteristics that are closely linked to values. This suggests that assumed similarity can, at least in part, be attributed to perceivers' tendency to particularly see others as sharing those aspects of the self that perceivers deem highly relevant to who they are and how they see themselves.",

The 1st 2 stages require fewer attentional resources than does the 3rd. However, when behavior is obscure (i.e., difficult to categorize because its features are not easily apprehended), the 1st stage should consume resources on which the 3rd stage depends, and undercorrected inferences should result. In 2 experiments, behavior was made obscure by distorting its visual or acoustical parameters. Although the obscure behaviors could logically have been attributed to the constraining situations in which they occurred, Ss who observed such behaviors were especially unlikely to correct their trait characterizations of the actors.",

      "title": "Deal with Complexity and Risk in Professional Relationship: The Transdisciplinary Logic",
      "abstract": "If the individual is a black box, an encounter is a risk that has to be managed. In everyday life, no one stops to think about relationships. Unless they serve an intention that “is not self-evident”, that makes an unusual emotion emerge. Do we think about the way we say hello to a colleague, unless we intend to get something from this “hello”? The transposition of the human relationship in the professional environment leads to a change in the reality level: putting on the clothes of a character and playing his part in a logical context that serves the aim and the plan of the organization, that itself is under the pressure of a demand that is quantitatively insatiable, and technically extremely demanding. Since the creation of wealth does not rely on an open-ended honey pot, de facto, the performance requirement becomes both an individual and group concern. The organization performance cannot suffer from the excessive variableness of the professional character’s reactions. Paradox among the paradoxes, getting the best out of the relational potential of a system that is organized, focused, constrained, would then consist in establish- ing an evolutionary relational framework to control, without killing it, what, out of the professional environment, comes within what is uncontrollable and spontaneous. How then, can we deal with the complexity and the risk in relationship, leveraging the transdisciplinary logic?",

      "abstract": "The evolution of the individual in ontogenesis has been studied throughout life and on all sides of development. Studies in the field based on medical rehability performed by a full team such as doctors, physiotherapists and psychologists and not only have shown that the link between the patient’s psychological state and exercise are factors in full dependence and any imbalance can trigger irreparable effects. Psychology is the science that studies the laws of formation, development, functioning and deficiencies related to psychism; it includes a series of fundamental concepts that include: psychic processes, psychic phenomena, psychic attributes, psychic states or psychic activities. Psychic phenomena are the component elements of psychism. In a sense, the psychic phenomena are manifested by external facts, by our behavior, by the motor actions started, by gestures or verbal actions; in the other sense, psychic phenomena are manifested by inner deeds, as the form of ideas, images, feelings, and desires. The motor acts without psychism would be only simple automatisms, without human specifications of adaptation, while the psychism without motor acts would be deprived of the fundamentals of formation and functioning as well as of its production mechanisms. Objective: The objective of this study is to highlight the causal problems of delayed medical recovery in relation to the psychological and emotional factors. This desktop review aims to identify psychoemotional disorders in the case of subjects with operated lumbar disc herniation and aims to adapt a specialized physiotherapeutic protocol by adapting to CIF. The result of this study will be found in the percentage of socio-professional reintegration of the subjects with operated lumbar disc herniation and implicitly the increase in the quality of life. Conclusions: 1) For an effective functional recovery, a psycho-emotional balance is needed; 2) A positive attitude actively influences medical rehabilitation; 3) Regaining physical, cognitive and social activities depend on the degree of psycho-emotional impairment.",

      "title": "The longing for passion",
      "abstract": "Spencer judged that his own personality was a failure. He could boast that he had created himself, but the human core was absent. His inner life seemed barren and without passion. However, he was more successful when he constructed a social environment for himself. This exterior world was more responsive than his inner one. In the outside world he could address his two basic needs: humour and love. The first of these came in the form of a playful interest in the manipulation of symbols. Typical of this was his youthful insistence on wearing caps – rather than hats – both as a matter of politics and as a joke. The second need was more urgent and required him to be creative. It stemmed from his inability to experience physical love. By implication this meant marriage and children were beyond him. He felt nothing towards women, and he feared that if he forced himself to consummate a sexual relationship he would then replicate his father's systematic cruelty towards his mother. Spencer's solution to this dilemma was to create a substitute family that would provide love without an element of risk. This surrogate also had the advantage of being less likely to expose his emotional flaws to criticism. A new family would replace the dictatorial one that had crushed his youthful attempts to rebel and gain independence. It would also relieve his immediate distress. However, such relief was not a cure, but only a palliative.",

Conversely, what harm can it do to him? How might such negotiation style impact international politics? I advance four arguments, derived primarily from insights in microsociology and from a close study of Hitler, Khrushchev, Saddam, Gaddafi and Milošević. First, face-to-face interactions are sui generis as a channel of communication because interlocutors are subject to the imperatives of time (to act and react swiftly), space (on the spot) and competence. Second, the ‘madman’ is ‘mad’ because he exploits these imperatives to dominate others. He manipulates and even disrupts the ‘rhythm’ of an interaction, through constant and unexpected swings in mood, pace and level of courteousness. Third, contrary to the image of him in popular perception, the ‘mad’ leader is for the most part rather composed and clear-headed, if not calculating, even when expressing anger. Finally, being ‘mad’ can backfire in the long run. Whether it is advisable to be ‘mad’ from a utilitarian perspective may depend on how long a leader expects his tenure to last.",

      "title": "External Locus of Control, Problem-Focused Coping and Attempted Suicide",
      "abstract": "It may be argued that suicidal behavior comprises three major manifestations: suicidal ideation, which is the process of thinking about committing suicide; suicide attempt, which is the process where an individual tries to commit suicide but is not successful; and completed suicide, the process of successfully ending one's life. Although these three processes can easily be viewed as a linear sequence, it must be noted that they do not occur in an unbroken stream. Many people entertain suicidal thoughts, but never reach the point where they feel compelled to act on these thoughts, nor will all unsuccessful attempters try again (and again) until they are successful, and not all completed suicides have a history of attempts (Kessler, Borges & Walters, 1999; Pirkis, Burgess & Dunt, 2000). Because the three modes of suicidal behavior do not form an automatic, inevitable chain of events, it could be argued that individuals who attempt or complete suicide must differ in some respect from those who do not move beyond suicidal thinking. Investigating differences between suicidal ideators and completed suicides is not easily accomplished unless there is sufficient information available about the deceased to permit psychological autopsies. However, studying differences between ideators and attempters is feasible because members of both groups are available for consultation. The present study compared suicidal ideators and attempters in the context of Lazarus' (1966) theory of stress and coping. More specifically, the investigation assessed the extent to which the two groups differ in terms of their locus of control orientation and level of problem-focused coping they use when faced with stress. In life there are many unusual, unpleasant, and threatening experiences which put people under stress. If that stress is too severe or if it is perceived as such, it can lead to damaging psychological effects. Lazarus (1966) suggested that perception of threat is influenced not only by characteristics of the stimulus but also by characteristics of the perceiving individual. One of these personal factors is the individual's locus of control orientation. Individuals with internal locus of control perceive the outcomes of their lives as resulting from their own behavior, whereas people with external locus of control attribute control to chance, fate, or powerful others (Levenson, 1981). Individuals who attribute control to external factors perceive the world differently than those who believe that they have personal control. Externals are more prone to perceive threat because they believe that they lack control, whereas internals tend to see situations as controllable and therefore perceive less threat. When people are confronted with stress they face two challenges: meeting the requirements of the stress situation and protecting the self from psychological disorganization (Lazarus, 1993, 2000). When they feel competent to handle the stress, they may opt for problem-focused coping; when they doubt their own competencies, emotion-focused coping may prevail. Those who use problem-focused coping likely approach stress as a problem to be solved; they move from merely thinking and worrying about their difficulties to actively taking steps to deal with them, thereby reducing stress. In the present study it was speculated that external locus of control and limited problem-focused coping skills may tip the balance between merely thinking about suicide and attempting suicide. Most suicidal behavior occurs in the context of recent, often severe life stress (Bonner & Rich, 1988; de Man, 1988a,b; de Man, Balkou & Iglesias, 1987; de Man, Leduc & Labreche-Gauthier, 1993; Farmer & Creed, 1989; Zimmerman, Pfohl, Stangle & Coryell, 1985) which generates feelings of threat and requires a coping response. Individuals with internal locus of control and good problem-focused coping skills generally will feel that they can do something constructive, and as a result appraise the situation as less threatening. …",

Se define aquí un continuo de preparación (\"preparedness\") y se sostiene que los organismos están preparados para asociar ciertos eventos, impreparados para algunos otros y contrapreparados para otros. Una revisión de los daros de los paradigmas tradicionales del aprendizaje muestra que es falso el supuesto de la equivalente asociabilidad. En el condicionamiento clásico las ratas están preparadas para asociar sabores con enfermedad incluso tras muy largos retrasos del refuerzo, pero contrapreparadas para asociar sabores y descarga eléctrica. En el entrenamiento instrumental, las palomas aprenden a picotear una tecla en ausencia de contingencia entre el picoteo y el grano (están preparadas), mientras que los gatos, por el contrario, tienen dificultad en aprender a lamerse a ellos mismos para escapar y los perros no bostezan por obtener comida (están contrapreparados). En la discriminación, los perros están contrapreparados para aprender que diferentes ubicaciones de estímulos discriminativos controlan la respuesta «ir/ no ir» y a aprender que diferentes cualidades controlan la respuesta de dirección. En la evitación, las respuestas del repertorio defensivo natural están preparadas para evitar la descarga eléctrica, mientras que las del repertorio apetitivo están contrapreparadas. La adquisición del lenguaje y la autonomía funcional de los motivos se consideran también formando parte del continuo de preparación. Por último, se especula que las leyes mismas del aprendizaje pueden variar con la preparación del organismo para las asociaciones y que diferentes mecanismos fisiológicos y cognitivos pueden covariar con esa dimensión.",

      "abstract": "The observations that animals obstructed in the execution of a particular ongoing or customary activity (e.g. attacking, copulating) tend either to direct the same activity toward another object or to engage in a completely different activity (e.g. doodling, grooming, preening) have traditionally been described as ‘displacement phenomena’. Both psychologists and ethologists currently interpret these phenomena in terms of some kind of displacement mechanism , which is assumed to displace the ‘energy’ or ‘drive’ from one reaction system to another. This type of interpretation is vague and ad hoc , and at best provides only a redundant description of the observed phenomena. The alternative interpretation proposed here looks upon the problem of the occurrence of the so‐called displacement activities as a special case of the general question of the factors determining the occurrence of any activity that exists in an animal's repertoire. In particular, it is suggested that all instances of displacement phenomena can be adequately accounted for in terms of the operation of three factors: ( a ) an increase in the level of arousal of the animal brought about by the obstructing event, ( b ) the relative habit strengths of the various activities in the repertoire of the animal, and ( c ) the nature of the sensory cues provided by the altered stimulus situation. This formulation incorporates the important ethological and psychological findings, and provides an interpretation of displacement phenomena which is not ad hoc and which suggests new lines of experimental work.",

Nadel can be understood to limit ‘symbol’ to those situations where the relationship between something and what it stands for is intended, conventional and can be put by the actor into words. It points up the distinction between the communication of meaning to people within the society (actors) and items of social behaviour or belief which express in an indirect or obscure fashion some principle, value, conflict or problem occurring in that society. Expression is not the same thing as communication. You can express your feelings to a stone, yet it is unmoved. You could also, like the mystic Henry Suso (Huizinga 1965, p. 148) eat three-quarters of an apple in the name of the Trinity and the remaining quarter in commemoration of ‘the love with which the heavenly Mother gave her tender child Jesus an apple to eat’ and unless you or Henry Suso told me, I would not, though I watched you twenty times, discern your symbolism or even that what you did was symbolical.",

      "title": "Striving for Survival: Thematic Study of Patricia McCormick's Never Fall Down",
      "abstract": "In contrast to prevailing trauma narratives that reduce adolescent war survivors to symbols of victimhood, psychic collapse, or moralized endurance, Patricia McCormick’s Never Fall Down articulates survival through a less valorized, yet psychologically intricate, instinctual paradigm. In this work, the survival practices of Arn Chorn-Pond are not questioned as the remnants of a heroism or ideology that was independent of genocide; instead, they are interpreted as deeply seated manifestations of what Freud termed the life-instinct, or Eros, fellow feeling, and permanence that motivate the psychic organization set in opposition to death or decomposition that is to say, one that cannot be explained in terms of programmed responses to a least-resistance-seeking genocide. The moral disengagement (a cognitive precondition that warrants individuals to relinquish moral standards to save themselves in extreme circumstances) and the strategic production of emotional, desensitisation and abdication of language can be placed at the forefront in understanding these forces as structurally called upon, rather than ethically deviant reactions, about the behaviours portrayed by Arn. The questions addressed are deepened by a tissue-like approach to the text combined with the trauma theory as well as Freudian drive theory, making it a fresh intervention to replace the prevailing patterns of martyrdom in the analysis of young adult literature. Never Fall does not portray survival as a triumph of ethics because the accounts that follow are not a story of survival and triumph but rather a precarious balancing of the soul, one that survives amidst moral turmoil. Such a reframing advances a novel critical discourse that redefines survival not as resistance, but as a conflicted, instinct-driven imperative shaped by unbearable historical conditions. The paper thus contributes a theoretically rigorous, ethically ambivalent, and narratologically specific reading of survival in post-genocidal adolescence.",

      "abstract": "Phantom cell phone signals are tactile, auditory, and/or visual experiences suggesting that a mobile device is receiving calls, text messages, or other push notifications when in fact it is not. These phantom sensations appear to be common among cell phone users, although prevalence rates vary between the different forms (phantom vibrations are the most common). Increasing efforts have been put in the understanding of what causes these phantom sensations and several psychological states and traits have been found to be associated. However, after almost a decade of phantom sensations research, it still remains a mystery whether these sensations are illusions (i.e., of habitual origin) or hallucinations (i.e., of cortical origin). Future studies are encouraged to conduct longitudinal research in which the different forms of phantom sensations are independently examined and not as a catch‐all container concept.",

Empathy, he wrote, is term that we use to refer to peculiar emotional linkage that subtends relationship of infant with other significant (1o, p. 8) [Consult also (ii) and (5).] The term complex used to convey idea of a system or assemblage of particulars like, for example, B complex vitamins. are using term empathic complex, then, to mean particular emotional linkage between a child and significant persons his environment. Sullivan primarily utilized term empathy connection with subtle process whereby certain emotional states, like anxiety, are transferred from mother to infant, but he did recognize that as child grew older he came to perceive through this same emotional linkage more overt manifestations regard to behavior. In fact, he sensed role of this emotional linkage throughout life of individual. We do not know much about fate of empathy, he wrote, in developmental history of people general. There are indications that it endures throughout life, at least some (io, p. 8).

Some individuals give credence to God as an existing transcendent reality; other people oscillate between belief and unbelief at different moments of their lives while some atheists adamantly deny God’s existence. Regardless of their stance, all three groups must have a certain mental conception or representation of the divinity to be able to believe in it, wrestle with it, or deny it. Such representation has significant antecedents in both parental representations (Freud, 1910; Rizzuto, 1979) and other affectively significant early objects and obtains from them prevailing emotional characteristics, which inevitably contribute to the dynamic organization of the relational or rejecting experiences the subject has with his/her personally conceived divinity.In this paper I offer a clinical example from a completed analysis to illustrate the patient’s libidinal and defensive and, at times, organizing use of the divinity during the course of his treatment.",

      "title": "Social games between bonobos and humans: evidence for shared intentionality?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Triadic social games are interesting from a cognitive perspective because they require a high degree of mutual social awareness. They consist of two agents incorporating an object in turn‐taking sequences and require individuals to coordinate their attention to the task, the object, and to one another. Social games are observed commonly in domesticated dogs interacting with humans, but they have received only little empirical attention in nonhuman primates. Here, we report observations of bonobos ( Pan paniscus ) engaging in social games with a human playmate. Our behavioral analyses revealed that the bonobos behaved in many ways similar to human children during these games. They were interested in the joint activity, rather than the play objects themselves, and used communicative gestures to encourage reluctant partners to perform their role, suggesting rudimentary understanding of others' intentions. Our observations thus may imply that shared intentionality, the ability to understand and shares intention with other individuals, has emerged in the primate lineage before the origins of hominids.

Perhaps the key to this difference lies in what we do with our emotional/psychic wounds which are a necessary part of the growth process. The book explores the inner landscape of this part of our psyche through the mythological figures of Balarama, Duryodhana and Bhima. It also examines the present day context of human existence which has ironically enhanced both our prowess and helplessness and thereby pushed this part of ourselves into our psychic/social underbelly.",

Similarly, in exploring human behaviour we, as persons, commence with the immediate social unit, and only later do we explore the interactions within and between larger societies.

Moreover, in Alarcón’s plays, prudent deception is invariably concerned with the maintenance of honour-virtue, and the discovery of moral truths, whilst cunning is employed in the pursuit of worldly or sensual goals such as social advancement, riches, and sexual gratification. A circumspect and reasoned approach often proves sufficient to expose the deceptions practised by others, but Alarcón’s protagonists must also learn to overcome the inducement to self-deception presented by the allure of worldly attributes such as beauty, wealth and position, and to regard these as irrelevant or illusory, and this kind of desengaño requires a higher degree of wisdom.",

One is a case of phenomenal invisibility, while the other is a case of misperception. When we do not see what is there or see something other than what is there, it is frequently the result of the same visual processes that are responsible for our seeing what is there. These phenomena are discussed, and the parallel between one of them, inattentional blindness, our failure to see what is there when we are not paying attention to it, is likened to our failure to see those we consider \"other,\" revealing how our prejudices influence what we see and what we don't.",

      "title": "What cannot be said?",
      "abstract": "What cannot be said? The question presses, as there are no words, or no fitting words, or no words that make sense let alone do justice, all perhaps in the face of demands (not) to speak. And, as voice collapses in the midst of the violence that confounds reference, degrades language, imposes silence, and enforces repression—what cannot be said may turn on privation, the grounds, incentives, and intentions of expression that are banished, disappeared, and colonized, often in the name of deterring and containing the \"dangerous\" word, the word assumed to be violent, perhaps intrinsically and perhaps as it's held to contravene the homologeō with so much \"barbarism.\" In this way, what cannot be said may also be a function of what's given or taken for granted, whether as capacity, presumption, affirmation, commonplace, law, or spirit, just as it may stem from surplus, the economies of nonstop expression that cannot bear quiet reflection on their own presumptions, not least the possibility that there is such a thing as too much all at once.What cannot be said? Speaking is fraught, in the midst of a breath-taking pandemic and the suffocating smoke—so much smoke—of the next war and an earth on fire. It is an altogether tense time, place, and manner to speak, at a moment when the idea, doctrine, and \"marketplace\" of \"free expression\" divides generations and fuels contemporary kulturkampf, a proto-stasis in which fewer and fewer want or care to hear from those who are not already in the \"proper\" (progressive, reactionary, tolerant, conservative, fundamentalist, etc., etc.) crowd, singing the proper tune in the right chords, the truths about all the big lies. The infinitely recallable words afloat in social media's gloomy cloud set the fear of being called out—ever later—into the calling to speak. The demand to burn books echoes from school board meeting to meeting, as trending tirades about the difference between cancelation and censorship flame, smolder, and flame back. More fire—throwing light on the fact that the problem at hand is a very old one. The hemlock has taken many forms, with varying levels of toxicity. The promise underwriting audi alteram partem has long provoked (better and worse) opposition and more than a few bans for violating standing \"terms of service.\"What cannot be said? It's fashionable to deem language incapable of revealing what \"matters\" and so best indicted as mere \"linguisticism.\" If the charge risks a certain hypocrisy, it is never self-evident what grounds good speech or embodies its power, whether to cross the line turned smudge between speaking and writing, and how best to conceive the work of interpretation, representation, and critique that continues to attend and confound expression. Though so many words yet strive to figure a rational-deliberative-public persona that may have long left the building, this aspiration with dwindling audience may be no less chilling than a fragmenting articulation of belief that demands recognition of an \"I\" that appears naïve to the speech-action on which its emergence hinges. One wonders then if much has changed, if we remain in a moment, as Foucault put it, that \"never attached much importance to the fact that, after all, speech exists\"—a denial that has well-served those who take the word as their own in the name of refusing any advice about the merits of learning more about how to talk about talk.What cannot be said? The question abides, multiplies, and compounds, not least within and between rhetoric and philosophy. What goes and what can perhaps only go without saying, for better and worse—that is, for the lifeworld? What is said in what's left unsaid, perhaps as the unsayable is the ground and demand to speak? What's not being said in the name of being and at the cost of becoming otherwise? What remains unsaid and unsayable, in silence and in the midst of the damage done, not least the damage done to language itself? What cannot be said in time and what saying has no place? What cannot be said for history? How does what cannot be said appear—as inability, choice, prohibition, transgression, virtue, imperative? What potential abides in the unsaid and unsayable, for truth, freedom, authority, judgment?What cannot be said? Quick and tidy replies will not do, except perhaps as evasion. This is partly to say that it is likely important not to introduce this special issue of Philosophy & Rhetoric, an extended and challenging consideration of the question—What cannot be said? It is not so much that the essays here speak for themselves, although in many ways they do, at the same time that they ask after and frequently trouble such certainty. It is not that they demand silence, even as they provoke quiet reflection. And it is not that they require an interpretive map, as they are best approached from multiple angles and taken up in various orders—the essays here sit in some tension, and also abide with and work for one another, in ways that invite discovery. Indeed, anything resembling a \"proper\" introduction may be less a distraction than evidence of a deep misunderstanding, a failure to grasp that the question of what cannot be said—as a question—may resist obligatory first words, the definitions, topoi, speech acts, and language games that are deemed prior and held so very tight, perhaps at the cost of language itself. The essays here, not least as they manifest the possibility that Adorno discerned in the essay's form, resist this conformity. In their own way, each \"says what is at issue and stops where it feels itself complete—not where nothing is left to say\" (1984, 152). Neither first nor last word, but a compound opening, an idea whose very form may amount to heresy.",

But the name and address are symbols of one's identity. In every-day life one identifies people by these criteria and they identify themselves in this way.

We speak about amnesia in this paper only when the consciousness is not deeply clouded, orientation is retained, and the possibility of forming impressions is not completely lost.

      "title": "The choreography of human attraction: physiological synchrony in a blind date setting",
      "abstract": "Abstract Humans are social animals whose mental wellbeing is shaped by the ability to attract and connect with each other. In a dating world, in which success can be determined by brief interactions, apart from physical features, there is a whole choreography of movements, physical reactions and subtle expressions that drive humans’ sexual attraction. To determine what drives attraction, we measured nonverbal dynamics between people during real-life interactions outside the laboratory, where dating is most relevant. Participants wore eye-tracking glasses with embedded cameras, and devices to measure physiological signals including heart rate and skin conductance. Crucially, visible signals that can be controlled, such as facial expressions or gaze, did not predict attraction. Instead, attraction was predicted by synchrony in heart rate and skin conductance between partners, which are unconscious and difficult to regulate. Our findings suggest that shared emotionality is vital for mutual attraction. Moreover, physiological synchrony may provide a medium for translating visible expressions into embodied emotions, which can turn into intentions via somatosensory simulation. Significance Statement In our modern world where millions of people meet online without interacting face-to-face, the question “what defines attraction” has become very relevant. In this study, we used modern technologies to lay down a foundation for the processes that drive human attraction during real-life interactions. Contrary to common belief, we found that attraction is not predicted by a frequency of expression or eye fixation duration, nor is linearly related to the participant’s autonomic nervous system activity. Importantly, we found that the more a participant synchronized their heart rate and skin conductance with their partner, the more they felt attracted toward that person. This study reveals a fundamental physiological process that plays a role in the formation of romantic relations.",

      "title": "Love and Moral Structures",
      "abstract": "This entry sketches ways in which placing love at morality's center—where love is conceived as various forms of good will—can point the way to a number of attractive and new (or neglected) options for moral theorists. These include treating virtues as internal and basic to both duty and value; relativizing all our moral virtues, obligations, and so on, to certain role-relationships we fill in persons' lives; focusing on actions' and attitudes' \"patients\" (understood as the people to whom anyone's occupying such relationships connects); and morally categorizing actions, including whether they are obligatory, forbidden, or merely permitted on the grounds of their agents' motivations rather than the actions' results. Such virtues basing, as we can call it, offers an appealing alternative to seeing either duty or the valuable as conceptually basic, and, indeed, regarding love as the form of our major moral virtues helps answer enduring questions about how to analyze each of them. Similarly, love is always of someone, the beloved (object of love) and, when theorists focus on these patients of loving actions, seeing the action's licitness as its lovingness to that Other within the role, they can recognize the real determinants of moral status not in self-interest, nor in optimization of the world condition, but in the agent's resolve to act helpfully. Likewise, as virtues, the various forms of love such as truthfulness (that is, willing one's auditor the good of true belief) or respect (i.e., willing someone such goods of personhood as self-governance) are features having which tends to make the loving person good within one or more of her relevant role-relationships: a good friend, for instance, or good as a spouse, or simply a good \"neighbor\" in the Christians' sense. That suggests a relational conception of moral life wherein any virtue or vice or duty that someone has is one that she has in some person-to-person role. In addition, whether an action, or emotional reaction, is loving is shaped by what is the moral subject's and agent's mind; such an input-driven account of actions' morality stands against any even partially consequence-dependent account of moral right and wrong. These options involve moral structures in either the sense that they reveal the logical structure of an important kind of moral judgment, or the sense that they disclose which, among the moral concepts and judgments, stand as fundamental and which derive from those bases.",

      "title": "Body Movements Generation for Virtual Characters and Social Robots",
      "abstract": "It has long been accepted in traditional animation that a character's expressions must be captured throughout the whole body as well as the face (Thomas & Johnston, 1995). Existing artificial agents express themselves using facial expressions, vocal intonation, body movements, and postures. Body language has been a focus of interest in research on embodied agents (virtual humans and social robots). It can be separated into four different areas that should be considered when animating virtual characters as well as social robots. (1) Postures: postures are specific positions that the body takes during a time-frame. Postures are an important modality during social interaction and play an important role as they can signal liking and affiliation (Lakin et al., 2003). Moreover, it has been established that postures are an effective medium to express emotion for humans (De Silva & Bianchi-Berthouze, 2004). Thus, virtual humans and social robots should be endowed with the capability to display adequate body postures. (2) Movement or gestures: throughout most of our daily interactions, gestures are used along with speech for effective communication (Cassell, 2000). For a review of the types of gestures that occur during interactions the reader can refer to Cassell (2000). Movements are also important for expressing emotions. Indeed, it has been shown that many emotions are differentiated by characteristic body movements and that these are effective clues for judging the emotional state of other people in the absence of facial and vocal clues (Atkinson et al., 2004). Body movements include the movements themselves as well as the manner in which they are performed, i.e. speed of movements, dynamics, and curvature – something captured by the traditional animation principles (Thomas & Johnston, 1995; Beck, 2012). Moreover, it should be noted that body movements occur in interaction with other elements, such as speech, facial expressions, gaze, all of which needs to be synchronised. (3) Proxemics: it is the distance between individuals during a social interaction. It is also indicative of emotional state. For example, angry people have a tendency to reduce the distance during social interaction, although this reduction would also be evident between intimate people.",

      "abstract": "The human being has been, for centuries, the subject of study from various scientific approaches; in some of them it has been found that he is an individual who possesses behaviors like some animals. However, he differs from them by his ability to anticipate, analyze and conceptualize the tools used for his survival and, in addition, by his capacity to adapt to the change to which he is continuously exposed. Therefore, in the development of these skills, thousands of years of study of their environment have been necessary; that is why learning has been one of the main instruments of the evolution of human beings. Thus, in this article of reflection, there are some of the aspects that must be taken into account when transmitting knowledge, whether in the social, cultural, emotional, academic, psychological context, among others; that is, for this to be a holistic learning, based on the fact that the teaching-learning processes do not occur in a linear way, but that these converge in a complex and chaotic manner.",

      "abstract": "We often notice that adolescent sexuality shows, especially in its first stages, an earlier onset and it is also more ephemeral and transitory, based more on acting and experiencing feelings than on building loving relations. In this expression of adolescence today, as well as in others, the recourse to sensations at the expense of relations is prevailing: feeling takes the place of thinking. We can gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of cuts self inflicted by some patients as linked, in the most serious cases, to the feeling of an inconsistent identity or a serious identity conflict, whose unruliness find temporary solace in the “envelope of suffering” it creates. These are clearly extreme measures which however allow through cutting one’s skin to re-establish certain primitive psychological functions, such as the sense of the body’s and of the Ego’s boundaries and the “feeling of being intact and consistent”.The recourse to these symptoms entails the reconstruction of the function of “linking different categories of feelings in a shared sensory space” that the patient did not enjoy due to his/her parental couple’s and family’s default exactly at this level. All the current changes in the family’s shapes attack the sense of identity and encourage the most superficial behavioural changes which can improperly or adhesively support the self and provide an apparent skin.",

      "abstract": "The word empathy has been used as a label for many different phenomena, including feeling what another person is feeling, understanding another person’s point of view, and imagining oneself in another person’s situation. Perhaps the most widely researched phenomenon called “empathy” involves an other-oriented emotional state that is congruent with the perceived welfare of another person. Feelings associated with empathy include sympathy, tenderness, and warmth toward the other person. Other manifestations of empathic emotions have been investigated, too, including empathic joy, empathic embarrassment, and empathic anger. As was the case with empathy, the term altruism has also been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including any type of prosocial behavior, as a collection of personality traits associated with helpful persons, and biological influences that evoke protective behaviors toward genetically related others. A particularly fruitful research tradition has focused on altruism as a motivational state with the ultimate goal of protecting or promoting the welfare of a valued other. For example, the empathy–altruism hypothesis claims that empathy (viewed here as an other-oriented emotional state) evokes an altruistic motivational state. Empathy and altruism, regardless of how they are construed, have important consequences for understanding human behavior and social relationships.",

      "abstract": "From many contemporary theoretical perspectives, the body and emotions play little role in the development of thinking and consciousness. If emotions are given any part it is in biasing thinking, rather then contributing to cognitive development. This volume, in contrast, presents alternatives to that position. From our perspective, embodied engagement with others – necessarily involving emotions – has a role in structuring the interactional conditions in which the development of thinking occurs. Just the body and emotions, however, are insufficient; the mythical baby isolated on a desert island would have a body and emotions (or at least the potential for their further development), but would not go on to develop human forms of thinking. What is needed is a shared history of routine patterns of interpersonal engagement. The body and emotions are necessary for setting up these forms of interaction and routines in which communication can emerge and then thinking and consciousness. In this sense, the development of human forms of thinking requires a social environment. We draw from Mead the point that self-awareness arises from interacting with others, and thus, self-consciousness is inherently social (Farr 1980; Mead 1909, 1910a, 1910b, 1922, 1934; Morss 1985).

In these \"narrative documents,\" or \"narratives,\" the main part of the information content consists in the description of \"events\" that relate the real or intended behavior of some \"actors\" (characters, personages, etc.)—the term \"event\" is taken here in its more general meaning, also covering strictly related notions like fact, action, state, and situation. These actors try to attain a specific result, experience particular situations, manipulate some (concrete or abstract) materials, send or receive messages, buy, sell, deliver, and so forth. Note that in these narratives, the actors or personages are not necessarily human beings; we can have narrative documents concerning, for example, the vicissitudes in the journey of a nuclear submarine (the \"actor,\" \"subject,\" or \"personage\") or the various avatars in the life of a commercial product. Note also that even if a large amount of narrative documents concerns natural language (NL) texts, this is not necessarily true. A photo representing a situation that verbalized could be expressed as \"Three nice girls are lying on the beach\" is not of course an NL text, yet it is still a narrative document.

      "title": "Over Humane en A-Humane Taal.",
      "abstract": "I want to distinguish between two fundamental modes of being. The primary mode is typified by activities that are absolutely unique and at the same time absolutely universal, such as being born, living, growing up, eating, working, playing, loving, dying. These activities originate from my undivided being. The secondary mode is typified by activities that are socially and culturally determined. I perform these as a person (personamask). When I act as an individual I cannot be replaced by someone else; it is impos-sible to measure these activities (they have no 'market-value') and I don't learn them in the literal sense - all this in contradistinction to my social or role-activities. Accordingly I want to distinguish between human and a-human language (the terms have no ethical implications), or between the I-mode and the YOU-mode and between two resulting ways of speaking. I can speak as an individual and as a person and these ways of speaking are typified in compliance with the above-mentioned characteristics. Human language is perhaps a somewhat neglected phenomenon in linguistics. An allied phenomenon is the tendency in our culture to transfer individual speaking to the domain of speaking as a person. When I mark off these distinctions against certain dimensions in socio-pragmalinguistics I find that orientation on the illocutionary effect plays a prominent part in personal speaking. Splitting up myself into speaker and hearer I project myself into the hearer, planning my formulations from his point of view to make myself understood. When I speak as an individual I am not primarily focused on communication and the illocutionary effect. Making myself understood to an actual or potential hearer is subordinate to the adequate expression of what lies on my mind. Moreover, when I speak as a person I am often focused on the perlocutionary effect, that I can try to act upon by means of conditional relevance and selection of the correct code. The options I have between formal varieties are in fact to be explained in terms of the directive function of language. When I speak as an individual the idea of communicative interaction recedes into the background and the issue of the perlocutionary effect is left out. Concerning the substance of my speaking I have at my disposal a register of words, expressions, syntactic constructions and last but not least para-linguistic means that correspond with this expressive function of language. Probably personal speaking has a set of distinctions that are character-ized in terms of different distances from individual speaking. When the relation between individual and personal speaking goes astray, the distancing from my individual 'I1 can turn into alienation from myself.",

      "abstract": "The interest in children's activities is constantly growing. Understanding the structure and meaning of these activities is the king's road to better educational approaches. When a child is engaged in any activity—painting, singing, building, make-believe, experimenting, exploring or whatever—there is an easily recognizable surface quality to his doings. His activities have a certain style which may reflect the child's physical or social surroundings. They are executed according to the child's skill and competence and are dependent to a greater or lesser degree on the equipment, tools, materials or utensils a child may use. This surface quality of children's activities varies according to his or her social, ethnic, economic and personal living conditions. But beyond this surface quality of activities there seems to exist a hidden, deep set of constraining rules of activities. It may even be possible to speak of a set of rules, a \"Grammar of Activity.\" These constraints seem to be universal and independent of the ethnic, social or economic backgrounds of the children but based on innate human systems such as the nervous, muscular and others. Our Study Centre for Children's Activities has for a few years observed, recorded and analyzed various activities of kindergarten children who came from different strata of the Israeli population: Jewish and Arab, city and rural, well-to-do and deprived, Kibbutz children and new immigrants.",

It is unclear whether this reflects chimpanzees' general inability or whether they have found other means to coordinate cooperative activities. In the present study chimpanzees could help a partner play her role in a mutually beneficial food-retrieval task either by transferring a needed tool (transfer condition) or by visually or acoustically communicating the hiding-location of the needed tool (communication condition). Overall, chimpanzees readily helped their partner by delivering the needed tool, but none of them communicated the hiding location of the tool to their partner reliably across trials. These results demonstrate that although chimpanzees can coordinate their cooperative activities by instrumentally helping their partner in her role, they do not readily use communication with their partner for this same end.",

      "abstract": "Interpassivity is a widespread, but mostly unacknowledged form of cultural behavior. It consists in letting others (other people, or animals, machines etc.) not work, but consume in one’s place. When certain people, for example, take care that others drink their beer for them, fotocopy or print texts out instead of reading them, let recording devices watch TV programmes in their place, use ritual machines that pray or believe for them vicariously, or are happy that certain TV-comedies already laugh about themselves, we have to speak of interpassivity. These actions are based on certain subjects’ preference to delegate their enjoyment instead of having it themselves. This, obviously, raises a number of quite uncanny, fundamental questions: Why do certain people do not want to have their enjoyment? And why do they, if the do not want to enjoy, go to such great pains in order to ensure that somebody else enjoys in their place? The theory of interpassivity has had considerable impacts on several disciplines such as philosophy, art theory, psychoanalysis, media theory, political theory, anthropology, theory of religion etc. This volume assembles essays that reach from the fundamental philosophical questions, concerning the paradoxical pleasure gained from delegated enjoyment, to their most current consequences: for example concerning interactivity and participation in the arts and in politics, generosity in culture, the status of belief, ritual and magic, cultural capitalism, civilized urban role-play etc.",

      "abstract": "Major personality changes can result from brain damage and dementia. We look at what happens when the known other is irretrievably altered by brain incident, forcing a paradigm shift in our relatedness. We cannot know the altered other without holding on to our previous experience of them, yet if we hold on too tightly, we cannot fully know the present, altered person. The challenge is to find new ways of living with the presence of history, not as a haunting presence, but as an essential and constitutive element in our present experience of the other. In the face of the many discontinuities, our struggle is to retain continuity and allegiance with the person we knew and with whom we had a shared world. In so doing, we can forge creative ways to relate to the altered other. \"Knowing\" is a complicated psychic function that includes not only the \"realistic\" aspects of the other as we perceive them now, but also the unconscious, ongoing knowing of the other as we have always known them. Two cases illustrate this psychic struggle. Finally, we confront the paradox of both knowing and not knowing the other at the same time. An attitude of loosely holding in our mind the other, as we knew them, while allowing for coming to know the altered other is the best we can do. To come to \"know\" an altered other is to allow for changes in our internal self and object relations so that we might know them more expansively as they were to us, as they currently are to us and also, importantly, what they might have been for us.",

Customarily, man's relation to the rest of the animal group is not regarded as a primary, dynamic force underlying his behavior. It is seen as something the human organism tries to get away from; the animal components of man must be repressed and escaped from for man to fit into society. Instincts, when regarded at all as inherited, evolutionary qualities, are considered more as nuisances than as essential parts of man and as the intrinsic foundation of his individual and social behavior.

      "abstract": "Given the unwittingness of negligence, personal responsibility for negligent conduct is puzzling. After all, how is it that one is responsible for what one did not intend to do or was unaware that one was doing? How, therefore, is one’s agency involved with one’s negligence so as to ground one’s responsibility for it? Negligence is an unwitting failure in agency to meet a standard requiring conduct that falls within one’s competency. Accordingly, negligent conduct involves agency in that negligence is a manifestation of agency failure. Now, nobody’s perfect. Human agency is innately fallible, and a measure of agency failure is, therefore, unavoidable. The more one’s negligence manifests failure in one’s agency as an individual, the more one is responsible for it. In contrast, the more one’s negligence involves the shortcomings innate to all human agency the less responsible one becomes, because one’s agency as an individual is less and less involved in one’s failure. Determinative of the measure of individual and of human failings mixed into an instance of negligent phi -ing is the background quality of one’s agency at meeting one’s competency at phi -ing. That is, how able one is at delivering on what one is able to competently do. The more able, the less one’s occasional instances of negligence involve manifestations of failures of one’s agency as an individual—nobody’s perfect—and are more manifestations of one’s agency’s innate human fallibility, making one less and less responsible for one’s negligence.",

How can two or more people jointly refer to an object that is long gone—or at least, that is not present in their surrounding? In this chapter, I offer a three-part answer to this question. First, I suggest that our capacity to remember intentional objects during memory retrieval depends on our capacity to direct our attention inwardly toward the relevant component of a memorial content—a mental act I call mental ostension. Second, I argue that, for us to refer to remembered intentional objects, we must possess the ability to refer to them indirectly or \"deferredly\" by way of mentally ostending toward a present mental content; in short, we must be capable of deferred mental ostension. Finally, I claim that to jointly reminisce, we must have the capacity to guide someone else's attention inwardly toward the relevant aspect of the mental content we want them to focus on so that they become aware of the past object we are deferredly ostending; that is, we need concerted deferred mental ostension.",

Rather, we are, often involuntarily, subjected to the effects of others’ technology use. The article characterizes this condition as affected bystanding, a condition that comes with quotidian, often banal, experiences of passivity and marginality. The affected bystander is neither entirely included nor excluded by a technological system and the practices of its operation. For this reason, affected bystanding is not adequately accounted for by established categories of exchange, participation, collaboration, use, and non-use. Since affected bystanding is often an undesirable condition, the article discusses how the affected bystander may address her condition— escalate it—by positioning herself as bystanding affector.",

These have to do with the contributions of a given stretch of discourse to the communication of which it is part. For example, verb forms may distinguish whether a sentence is to be understood as declarative or imperative. The key characteristic of the signaling function is that meaning is directly encoded in, and read off of, some aspect of the form of the utterance. Second, however, there are what might be termed the goal functions of discourse, the ways in which speech, as a form of social action, is used to accomplish particular ends that the speaker has (cf. Silverstein 1976). For example, it may be used to build a social alliance or to provoke or to obtain information. One characteristic that differentiates goal functions from signaling functions is that the goal function is usually not itself independently specified in the form of the discourse. We must infer such functions from observation of the role of discourse in ongoing social life.",

      "title": "Identification (With the Aggressor)",
      "abstract": "Within the broader framework of psychoanalytic conceptualizations of identification processes, Sándor Ferenczi's concept of 'identification with the aggressor' constitutes a core understanding of children's response to abuse. In response to an assault, the isolated, terrified child subordinates herself to the aggressor's will. She gives up her self, and 'becomes' what he wants her to be, both as a survival response when danger threatens, and as a tactic to ensure continued belonging to the family when rejection looms. Compensatory narcissistic fantasies may provide a feeling of specialness that numbs and replaces insecurities and despair; but in fact, along with accommodation on mental and moral levels, they facilitate compliance with the aggressor. Identification with the aggressor often continues as a persisting tendency; this tendency is often found in children and adults who have not been grossly abused, suggesting that more subtle acts like emotional abandonment and narcissistic exploitation can have long-standing traumatic effects. Its pervasiveness suggests that it may be an built-in response potential triggered by a fear of social exclusion, which may have evolved to maintain the social hierarchy and cooperation necessary to a species relying on a group survival strategy. This phenomenon may shed light on the puzzle of authoritarianism, notably, why so many people are drawn to authoritarian leaders and movements, often against their own real interests, suggesting that identification with the aggressor is the intrapsychic core of authoritarian attitudes.",

In fact, he is the hero for the same reasons as require us to acknowledge the reality, force, and limitations of the other characters in so far as they exist for us (in their varying degrees of density) as characters at all. His ‘heroism’ requires their specific selves as its very condition. The terms on which they enter into the action as characters are those examined most profoundly and thoroughly in Lear – in what is at issue in his self and his experience, in his particular ‘address’ or ‘stance’ towards his world, and what his transactions with it reveal about the world that he, and his world, and the other characters' transactions, constitute for us. Each of the other characters, being composed by the same creative activity out of the same material as he, though in a way that testifies to his larger stature and vitality, unfolds a kind of commentary on him – as he on them.",

Indeed, research suggests that more than two-fifths of the population in Britain have reported a supernatural experience and one-quarter of Americans claim to have felt or sensed a supernatural presence. They are encountered in many ways; however, most commonly they are reported as subjective experiences including feelings, the sense of a presence, out-of-body experiences or paranormal dreams. These subjective experiences are often encountered on or in the body, and the source of the experience rarely has a visible source. As a result, sharing these experiences with others can pose interactional challenges due to the lack of a visible, shared reference. This chapter will introduce the nature of supernatural experiences and their subjective qualities, drawing upon examples to illustrate a typical event. It will then explore the interactional challenges posed by these experiences and investigate how individuals use talk and gesture to communicate and share their embodied experiences with others. In doing so, this chapter will provide an introduction to the role of the self during supernatural encounters and explore how the body is used to not only communicate and share experience but also to transpose and validate extraordinary claims.",

      "title": "Protagonists and Antagonists in the Fiction of Flannery O'Connor",
      "abstract": "Many of Flannery O'Connor's stories involve two characters in conflict, a relation of protagonist and antagonist central to the dramatization and development of her themes. (1) Although these relations vary from story to story, they may be broadly classified as relationships of metaphor and relationships of metonymy, (2) terms useful in distinguishing between stories in which the protagonist and antagonist live in the same moral universe and stories in which they do not. In some stories the protagonist and antagonist are bonded by some essential moral principle, and we can call this relation metaphorical. familiar example would be the moral identity shared by the Misfit and the grandmother in A Man Is Hard to Find. When the grandmother in a moment of awakening tells the Misfit that he is one of her own children, she expresses her understanding of the spiritual reality in which they both dwell. In other stories, however, the protagonist and antagonist circle in different moral orbits, a disjunction we might call metonymic. In fact, the central revelation of the story may be that the two characters inhabit moral spheres related only by accident or association. In Good Country People. for example, the prospect of dying that seems to bind Hulga-Joy and Manley Pointer is shown as a sentimentality masking their separate moral identities rooted in self-pity for Hulga-Joy, nihilism for Manley. The text, moreover, endorses neither view and implies no overriding transcendent reality. We might say, therefore, that the Misfit and the grandmother, metaphorically related, participate in a spiritual reality immanent in the world. But Hulga-Joy and Manley, metonymically related, dramatize a world involved in competing and unreconciled moral dimensions. Where the relation of the Misfit and the grandmother reveals the presence in the world of a spiritual community linking all humankind, the relation of Hulga-Joy and Manley Pointer manifests a disruption of equivalence and a world destablized by competing moral forces. In short, when O'Connor uses character involved in a metaphorical relation, she figures a world in which understanding can be completed and filled. It is a world in which meaning is present and available through intuitions of unity and wholeness. In her fiction involving metonymic relation, however, the world is not whole and complete. There remain the competing moral schemes suggested but not clarified, and this disjunction may suggest an unspoken quality in her world of the ominous, of the dark and disturbing, of the malign. The implication is that O'Connor in her fiction does not consistently rewrite the same script, and that her religious perspective is more complex than generally acknowledged. Her vision was not established at an early age and then made sophisticated by her growing artistic skills. Rather, her fiction shows a fluctuation between inscriptions of a world in which a unity is suggested through the relation of the antagonist and protagonist, and a world in which the relation suggests an ambivalence that unsettles any sense of a fixed, understandable world. In this essay I want to discuss Good Country People and Parker's Back as representative of ambivalent or metonymic relations, Revelation and A Man Is Hard to Find as representative of unified or metaphorical ones. (3) The surface differences between the Misfit and the grandmother in A Man Is Hard to Find are shown to disguise a relation in which they share a common moral and spiritual reality--a relation of metaphor. Morally, the grandmother and the Misfit are motivated by the principle of self-interest. The reflective Misfit articulates for the unreflective grandmother that since there is no clear proof that Christ ever raised the dead, human activity should satisfy private desires: there is nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can--by killing someone or burning down his house or doing some other meanness (Stories, 132). …",

We predicted people would anthropomorphize an embodied humanoid robot more than a robot–like agent, and a collocated more than a remote robot. A robot or robot–like agent interviewed participants about their health. Participants were either present with the robot/agent, or interacted remotely with the robot/agent projected life–size on a screen. Participants were more engaged, disclosed less undesirable behavior, and forgot more with the robot versus the agent. They ate less and anthropomorphized most with the collocated robot. Participants interacted socially and attempted conversational grounding with the robot/agent though aware it was a machine. Basic questions remain about how people resolve the ambiguity of interacting with a humanlike nonhuman.",

      "abstract": "Aloupis states that the subject grows up between drive demands and social requirements. The subject is attracted to the object for wish fulfilment and rejection of unpleasure. These two attractions continue throughout human life. The acknowledgement of pleasure and the identification of unpleasure lead to expectation and patience, which becomes the primary masochistic position. Its evolution signifies the psychic investment of unpleasure and pain following the vicissitudes of the fusion between eros and death drive. The refusal of the unpleasure leads to the construction of defenses with the aim of avoidance; the more psychic they are, the less they need bodily and motor discharge. Oriented by the pleasure/unpleasure principle, this subjective position orchestrates the work of negative, constantly enriching the unconscious through repression. However, the psychic apparatus has at its disposal other defenses: negation, splitting, unbinding, denial, or foreclosure to neutralize object aggressions. Humans are characterized by the capacity of thinking and acquisition of the language. Both subjectively and socially, the avoidance of conflict and pain may result in a lifetime struggle against passivity and thought. In our contemporary world, we have witnessed social phenomena in which hyperactivity, denial in community, destruction of thinking are emphasized and privileged.",

      "title": "On the origins of conversation",
      "abstract": "Conversation, I suggest, is rarely if ever an end in itself. It originates in more basic joint activities and is created as a way of coordinating those activities. The idea is that whenever people are talking, they are engaged in two joint activities simultaneously. They participate, first of all, in basic joint activities, what they are really doing. They also participate in coordinating joint actions, the talk and other signals by which they coordinate their basic activities. Moving a table divides into (a) the table move proper, the basic joint activity, and (b) the talk by which the participants coordinate their individual actions in that basic activity. Other joint activities — for example, playing in a string quartet, playing a game, buying goods at a market, and doing business by telephone — appear to divide into the same two parts. Basic and coordinating activities tend to look different. Basic joint actions may take a variety of forms. In the table move and in the musical performance, the basic actions are physical. In the poker game, in the call to directory enquiries, and in the conversation between Allen and Blake, the basic actions are transfers of money, ownership, and information. Coordinating actions, in contrast, are always communicative acts. In two-person activities, they tend to originate in adjacency pairs that function as minimal joint projects. In the first part of a pair, one of the participants proposes a basic action for the pair to carry out. In the second part, the other participant typically agrees to, modifies, or declines that proposal. It is hardly surprising, then, that conversations tend to emerge as sequences of adjacency pairs.",

One form of supportive robots are socially assistive robots which are specifically built for communicating with humans, e.g., as service robots or personal companions. As they understand humans through artificial intelligence, these robots will at some point make wrong assumptions about the humans' current state and give an unexpected response. In human-human conversations, unexpected responses happen frequently. However, it is currently unclear how such robots should act if they understand that the human did not expect their response, or even showing the uncertainty of their response in the first place. For this, we explore the different forms of potential uncertainties during human-robot conversations and how humanoids can, through verbal and non-verbal cues, communicate these uncertainties.",

      "abstract": "Whether conceptually or experientially atmospheres are hazy. Atmospheric situations often emerge without us being able to control or fully apprehend the conditions of their emergence. Atmospheres affect us not at the cognitive level but through embodiment - through the sensory capacities of our bodies and subsequent registers of affect. We feel atmospheres. Dance improvisers also feel what emerges in an improvisation, whether as the adrenalizing effect of the audience’s presence or because the dancer is immersed in their own movement (as the affect of interest). But dance improvisation is a situation in which atmospheres (and their affective impacts) emerge in unpredictable ways. Becoming attuned to ‘what is going on’ is an aspect of improvisational skill but improvised performance is also an exposure to ‘not knowing’ – not knowing what will happen (or how it will change), not knowing what motivated the movement. This exposure to ‘forces of not knowing’ is similar to many atmospheric situations in everyday life which we negotiate according to personal habits and personal levels of discernment. This performative paper picks up on Gernot Bőhme’s concept of a “new aesthetics” such that hazy atmospheres, and the uncertainty of where they come from, can be claimed as part of an aesthetic encounter. It also reflects on the act of breathing as a potential interface between aesthetic and scientific definitions of ‘atmosphere’.",

A trauma is something that overwhelms the psyche in a more than momentary way arousing fear or even terror, often a fear of death and a sense that life is not worth living. Trauma interferes with the capacity to symbolise. The traumatised person loses a sense of there being a containing figure, internally or externally. Language gets its possibility and meaning from shared activities and practices. So to lose one's language is to lose a form of life. One aspect of the cultural trauma perpetrated on hunter-gather cultures has been the colonial attempt to obliterate local language speaking, for example in Canada when the policy was to remove native. As with individuals, a cultural traumatic event may be either what used to be called in insurance policy documents an \"Act of God\" or it may be more or less man-made.",

Our capacities to perceive and understand how things are, and what response is appropriate to them, and our ability to respond appropriately, make us into persons, i.e. creatures with the ability to direct their own life in accordance with their appreciation of themselves and their environment, and of the reasons with which, given how they are, the world presents them. An explanation of normativity would explain the various puzzling aspects of this complex phenomenon. In particular it would explain how it is that aspects of the world can constitute reasons for cognitive, emotive, and volitional responses; how it is that we can come to realise that certain cognitive, emotional or volitional responses are appropriate in various circumstances, and inappropriate in others; and how it is that we can respond appropriately.

Both approaches overlook the fact that languageuse deeply informs mental states, such that comparing human mental states to the mental states of nonlinguistic animals is misguided. In order to avoid both pitfalls — assuming that animals have mental lives just like we do, or assuming that they have no mental lives at all — I argue for a functional methodological approach. Researchers should study animal cognition by identifying environmental inputs, the functional role of internal states, and behavioral outputs. Doing so will allow for cross-species comparisons in a way that the use of folk psychological terms does not.",

Moreover, they will each manifestly want others to conform to such beneficial norms and so each may aspire without fear of contradiction to speak for all in regulating another, whether in educating them, in enjoining conformity, or in correcting offenders. This will give the demands of their social norms a categorical, if still overrideable status. With those norms manifest—and their acceptance by everyone also manifest—they will each be disposed to commit to conforming and upholding those norms: to bet on themselves to do so, at risk of not being able to excuse a failure by invoking a misleading mind or a changed mind. Indeed, they will be committed to this line just by acquiescing in the expectations of others. Among the attitudes to which they will commit in this active or virtual way is the intention to obey and uphold relevant norms: in effect, to value universal conformity in a decisive way. In that case, they will treat the desiderata that explain the commitment as impartial values. And as they may recognize and commit to such values, so they may do so with more personal or sectional values as well.",

The child finds certain aspects of the anxieties intolerable, and so begins to set up defences. In perfectionism a hate of the world that would turn it upside down is dealt with in advance.

      "abstract": "\"Why Didn't She Say Something Sooner?\"Doubt, Denial, Silencing, and the Epistemic Harms of the #MeToo Movement Heather Stewart (bio) \"It may be that the most debilitating postmemories … are those instilled by silence.\" (Susan J. Brison)1 \"Why didn't you say something Sooner?\" has become a familiar refrain—a question frequently leveled at those victims/survivors2 of sexual violation3 who delay their decisions to bring forward testimonies or reports of their experiences until sometime in the future, at times, long after the event(s) transpired. This question (\"why didn't you/she say something sooner?\") is not only a linguistic mechanism for casting doubt on the testimonies of particular victims in isolated situations (i.e., to the person the question is directed at), but, given the regularity with which this question is asked of victims/survivors, has also come to reflect broader, deep-seeded epistemic assumptions about members of particular identity groups (namely, women and especially queer women or women of colour) and their abilities to be credible givers of knowledge more generally. This question—and the epistemic assumptions loaded into it—contributes to the structural and systemic doubting of victims/survivors of sexual violation at both social and political levels. This pervasive doubting of victims/survivors contributes to various forms of epistemic injustice against them4 and, consequently, harms victims/survivors in a variety of ways. While the harms that victims/survivors often experience in the aftermath of sexual violation, and subsequently in deciding whether or not and when to report it, are many and varied—ranging from physical harms to their bodies, to psychological and emotional harms, and interpersonal or social harms—this paper seeks to highlight a distinct type of harm that victims/survivors too often experience when bringing forth (or withholding) testimony of sexual violation, namely, epistemic harm. The role of epistemic harm as a distinct and significant category of harm experienced by victims/survivors of sexual violation (particularly [End Page 68] during the current cultural and political rise of the #MeToo movement) has been undertheorized in the growing scholarly engagement with victims/survivor testimony in the #MeToo movement, and this paper intends to rectify this gap. In what follows, I argue that a particular category of harm—that which is characteristically epistemic in nature—is pervasive among those choosing whether, how, and when to bring forward testimony of sexual violation, particularly as part of a larger movement among victims/survivors, but nevertheless has not been sufficiently analyzed in scholarly examinations of the movement. Moreover, I argue that insofar as the uniquely epistemic harm that results from a variety of oppressive epistemic phenomena (namely, testimonial injustice, gaslighting, and testimonial smothering) are serious and enduring, the nature of this harm and its effects on victims/survivors are worth attending to in their own right. More precisely, I contend that an adequate understanding of the various harms experienced by victims/survivors of sexual violation demands an exploration of this particular category of harm. Doing so helps to elucidate a morally significant dimension of a rapidly growing movement. The paper will proceed as follows. In section I, I will contextualize the philosophical concept of epistemic injustice as it has developed in feminist and social epistemology literatures.5 I will then describe three distinct forms that epistemic injustice can take, all of which are prevalent in the era of the #MeToo movement. In section II, I will draw out the harms of the three types of epistemic injustice detailed in section I. Importantly, I will show how these harms are serious and enduring not only for those victims/survivors who experience them qua individuals, but also for victims/survivors as a group, whose credibility is collectively undermined as doubt pervades at social and political levels. This, I con-tend, also has important social and political consequences, particularly for shaping the backdrop in which these conversations are happening. With analyses of the epistemic phenomena and their related harms in hand, in section III, I examine one recent case, that of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony of sexual violation against then United States Supreme Court nominee (now United States Supreme Court Justice), Brett Kavanaugh. This case...",

      "title": "Geographies of compulsive bodies: Reimagining the nature of Tourette syndrome",
      "abstract": "In understanding human being, in the past decade human geographers, and in particular those concerned with deviations from the norms have sought to understand human conditions and their alternative ways of being with the world (see Hansen & Philo, 2007). In seeking to contribute to and expand on this work, this paper does two things. First, it problematizes how human conditions have come to be understood in almost exclusively medical terms. In lacking a consideration for socio-spatial contexts in ways conditions express, a particular imagination of these conditions is created. Tourette syndrome (TS) is such a human condition that is currently being understood as a phenomenon that occurs strictly in the brain and in the body parts involved in its expression. Consequently, its distinctly spatial nature is not recognised as contributing to TS’s understanding, despite its pronunciation in compulsive behaviours that evoke physical interactions with socio-material environments - e.g. compulsive touching and symmetry or balance seeking behaviour. Therefore, human geographical conceptualisations of ‘place’ could help advance the understanding of the condition and the circumstances of its expressions. Second, by exploring TS induced bodily interactions with socio-material environments through literature on TS in neuropsychiatry, embodiment health and disability geography, and affect and the sensory in nonrepresentational theories, the paper seeks to reimagine the nature of the TS condition. In this process, the paper aims to help advance human geographical understandings of affective interactions with the more-than-human through the concept of compulsivity. Herewith, the paper suggests pathways to new research on alternative human conditions that can help understand how human beings relate to the world around them. As such, the paper calls for research that does not only seek to understand what makes human conditions different, but how differences help to understand human being.",

      "abstract": "In the previous chapter I reasoned in terms of the actions of a single ritual leader's consciousness, working with culturally given materials and clarifying or harmonizing sets of implications and associations of the sacred symbols. When the products of such work are incorporated in public rituals and assimilated by the audiences, the result is an ordering and elaboration of the fans of connotations that characterize sacred symbols. In this way, the cosmological constructions of the different Ok sub-traditions are developed and elaborated in different directions. But there is also another aspect of the private use of symbols: when culturally validated and standardized symbols are used as vehicles for substituted themes and fantasies by the individual. If such themes and fantasies have a repressed or subconscious character, a disposition towards them may be widely present or easily induced, and thereby they may become shared in an audience or congregation through only mild suggestion and innuendo, perhaps largely unconscious both on the part of the person who originates the process and those who are influenced by it. Implicit and supressed metathemes can thus become established and developed, and thereupon be articulated and made explicit, till finally they become recognized as the essential themes of the ritual in question.",

One who does not achieve such kind of love can not find happiness in life, and is bound to be unproductive. Thus, an intportant question remains here: can transference be used for eniotions as it is used for instruction? The answer to this question is sintply yes. Transference from concrete to abstract, or from one emotion to anather is possible in orientation of emotions. It is the task of education to expose potential emotions, develop and finally establish a balance among them.",

      "abstract": "A basic agent has been constructed which integrates limited natural language understanding and generation, temporal planning and reasoning, plan execution, simulated symbolic perception, episodic memory, and some general world knowledge. The agent is cast as a robot submarine operating in a two‐dimensional simulated “Seaworld” about which it has only partial knowledge. It can communicate with people in a vocabulary of about 800 common English words using a medium coverage grammar. The agent maintains an episodic memory of events in its life and has a limited ability to reflect on those events. A person can make statements to the agent, ask it questions, and give it commands. In response to commands, a temporal task planner is invoked to synthesize a plan, which is then executed at an appropriate future time. A large variety of temporal references in natural language are interpreted with respect to agent time. The agent can form and retain compound future plans, and replan in response to new information or new commands. Natural language verbs are represented in a state transition semantics for compatibility with the planner. The agent is able to give terse answers to questions about its past experiences, present activities and perceptions, future intentions, and general knowledge. No other artificial intelligence artifact with this range of capabilities has previously been constructed.",

The final category involves physical characteristics that compromise bodily appearance or functioning. Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance. Like the other types of stigma, undesirable physical characteristics isolate some individuals, disqualifying them from full social acceptance. Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the nonstigmatized is often awkward and uncertain. Tension is manifest in people's tendency to avoid eye contact, make guarded references to the stigma, or avoid everyday words that suddenly become taboo; it leads both parties to consider avoiding or withdrawing from encounters.",

      "title": "Fear of strangers in children and the orienting reaction",
      "abstract": "The phenomenon of fear of strangers (FS) is reviewed in light of recent findings in neurophysiology, ethology, developmental and cognitive psychology. Responses to strangers by infants are variable, including looking, withdrawal, clinging, rigidity and screaming. Visual fixation of strangers is invariable in humans and animals. The evolutionary survival value of FS in humans has been questioned. The theory that this behavior prevents the dilution of the attachment bond late in infancy when the child cannot flee an enemy is critically examined. Such a behavioral mechanism whereby infants were programmed to fear members of their own species would have been of little survival value in early human hunting and gathering societies where parent mortality was high. Fear of strangers has also been accounted for on the basis of cognitive conflict induced in infants by strangers. This theory does not explain why FS appears in human infants several months after discrimination of familiar from strange objects is perceptually possible. The orienting reaction (OR) elicited by changes in the environment and characterized by heightened arousal might be important in understanding the development of the FS response. The adaptive value of the OR may be the maintenance of an optimal distance between novel stimuli and the infant until such time as informational uncertainty about the stimulus is reduced. Maturation of the OR in the latter part of the first year of life permits the child to consider informational variables involved in a novel object or stranger and determine the nature of his response. Physiological measurements such as EKG could be used experimentally to determine whether an OR is evoked in infants by the appearance of a stranger.",

Types of learning commonly recognized are: Habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, operant conditioning, trial and error, taste aversion, latent learning, cultural learning, imprinting, insight learning, learning-set learning and instinct. The term memory must include at least two separate processes. It must involve, on the one hand, that of learning something and on the other, at some later date, recalling that thing. What lies between the learning and (he remembering must be some permanent record — a memory trace — within the brain. Memory exists in at least two forms: memory for very recent events (short-term) which is relatively labile and easily disruptable; and long-term memory, which is much more stable. Not everything that gets into short-term memory becomes fixed in the long-term store; a filtering mechanism selects things that might be important and discards the rest.",

Good communication is the foundation of any successful relationship and it is a skill that envolves throughout a lifetime. Even when people stop speaking, they do not cease to communicate, because their bodies are constantly sending information about themselves. Body language goes a long way in leaving a powerful impression on people we come across in our daily life. These signals may indicate the current emotional state of the speaker, but, depending on different cultures, they can also be misunderstood. Therefore, understanding non-verbal communication should be a key to effective communication. Gestures are an important part of our body language. Not only can they be used to complement and support what is being spoken, sometimes, they can act as the primary tool of communicating what we think, and do that more effectively than even words. Our hands play a significant role in communication throughout history. These hand gestures are the spontaneous creations of individual speaker, unique and personal. This paper presents communicational development throughout history and examines the role of hand gestures in non-verbal communication. Additionally, it examines a close connection our hands have with our brain by practicing Mudras.",

But since some face-to-face groups are not primary groups (e.g., formal institutions) and since some primary groups are not face-to-face (e.g., a widely scattered kinship group), the spatial contiguity is not essential. Temporal priority is not essential, since many primary groups are formed by adults. These are accidents, the essence of the primary group being the relation which corresponds to ideas, images, and feelings of a specific and easily identified character. A family is a primary group only if these relations exist. Discipline in school and home may follow institutional forms or primary group patterns, but the family is not a primary group merely because of a common dwelling. The essence of the primary group is its functional and emotional character. Temporal priority and spatial contiguity are accidents.",

Examples include consistent asymmetry, similar to chirality in chemistry, the turning of the head to the right in the last weeks of gestation, and during kissing as an adult.3 There is also the phenomenon of synchrony whereby audiences clap in unison, people walk in time across bridges,4 or women living in the same house menstruate at the same time.\n\nPerhaps the complex way in which people or groups interrelate may be more readily understood if their behaviour is seen to be akin to that of physical interactions. Varying topics may engender agreement, or disagreement. Where there is agreement there is harmony, even sympathy. Where there is disagreement, with antipathetic attitudes and views, a division is created which forms a barrier, an interface.\n\nThe term interface has wider usage in science than in common parlance.

      "abstract": "Responding negatively to inequity is not a uniquely human trait. Some of our closest evolutionary ancestors respond negatively when treated less well than a conspecific. Comparative work between humans and other primates can help elucidate the evolutionary underpinnings of humans' social preferences.Results from studies of nonhuman primates, in particular chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, are presented in comparison to human results that have been collected during economic game studies in humans, such as in the Ultimatum Game or Impunity Game.Among nonhuman primates, a frequent behavioral reaction to inequity is to refuse to continue the interaction. While in some cases this response appears to be caused by the inequitable distribution, in others, it seems to be caused by another individual's inequitable behavior. While these reactions are similar to those of humans, this reaction does not appear to be a sense of fairness in the way that we think of it in humans. Neither nonhuman primate species alters their behavior when they are the benefited individual, and in an experimental situation, chimpanzees do not alter their behavior to obtain food for their partner as well as for themselves.Although there are differences between human and nonhuman primate responses, such studies allow us to better understand the evolution of our own responses to inequity. Given the strong behavioral reactions that even monkeys show to inequitable treatment, it is not surprising that humans are concerned with equity. Such comparisons increase understanding of issues such as healthcare disparities in humans.",

Such awareness is required for the simplest and most common type of composite acts: sequences. To perform a sequence of acts, a cognitive agent should start performing one step when, and only when, it comes to believe that the previous one has been completed. We present a model for interleaving action, reasoning, and perception in order to allow for the conscious performance of sequences of acts. To define such a model, the notion of act completion needs to be characterized. This is achieved by developing a formal system in which acts are classified along the dimensions of telicity and primitiveness.

Exploratory activity and play are generally linked together as similar if not identical phenomena, based it seems on the fact that both share a similar motivational basis. Exploratory behaviour, are forms of intrinsically motivated behavior that are not directed at the achievement of some externally imposed goal, or even the satisfaction of some internal drive or need. The problem is of course that play encompasses such a large variety of forms of behavior, from activity on a jungle gym to playing house to building a castle from blocks, to acting out a trip into space or similar make-believe activity. The temporal succession from exploration to play is at least strongly implied in C. Hutt's formulation of specific and diversive exploration.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important conditions for the adequacy of communication process is, as it’s well known, the intentionality, by which the information between transmitter and receiver takes place. This is the case for verbal component of communication. What about the nonverbal one, more exactly, do we consciously use, or do us not this language? And because the intentionality is based on conscious character of our inter-relations, it can be said that the communication occurs only when the transmitter send intentionally a message to the receiver. This would include speech and some nonverbal behaviors, such as different aspects pointing or attention maintaining. From the producing and receiving signs perspective, the intentional and conscious behavior might be differently approached. The tacit dimensions of communication may have an enormous impact for interlocutor further behavior and reactions. As Paul Watzlawick stated, the behavior might be “non-communicative” only if there is no other person around (in one way or another). Once the other person is present, the whole behavior becomes communicative. The paper aims to identify an answer to the following question: to what extent can we talk about intentionality, by referring to posture, gestures, and facial expressions, shortly, to nonverbal communication component? This is justified by different researches’ points of view: those who support this possibility and those ones who amend it. Another issue the present paper aims to approach is that that people send messages about them through body language, but not in a declarative manner, as part of a discourse; this raises some questions about nonverbal valences",

We are constantly sending out and responding to social signals. By measuring brain activity we find that most of these signals are transmitted and received without awareness, as in the contagious effects of fear, and in the mirroring of action and emotion. Contagious signals embed us in the social world and can make us behave in a more social manner, maximising gains for the group rather than for ourselves.However, higher level cognitive processes also have a critical role in social behaviour. Through mentalising, for example, we can take account the intentions and beliefs of other people. In particular, we can consider what other people think about us. The desire for a good reputation in the eyes of others also makes us behave in a more social manner.Failures of the social brain are evident in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which respectively have revealed under- and over-use of mentalizing. In autism, which is characterised by reduced contagion and lack of spontaneous mentalizing, more than one component of the social brain may be compromised. Nevertheless, some islets of social capacities are present even in this disorder. These hint at many layers in the complex networks of our social brain.

      "title": "Computational analysis of mannerism gestures",
      "abstract": "Humans perform various gestures in everyday life. While some of these gestures are typically well understood amongst a community (such as \"hello\" and \"goodbye\"), many gestures and movement are typical of an individual's style, body language or mannerisms. Examples of such gestures include the manner is which a person laughs, hand gestures used to converse or the manner in which a person performs a dance sequence. Individuals possess a large vocabulary of mannerism gestures. Conventional modeling of gestures as a series of poses for the purpose of automatically recognizing gestures is inadequate for modeling mannerism gestures. In this paper we propose a novel method to model mannerism gestures. Gestures are modeled as a sequence of events that take place within the segments and the joints of the human body. Each gesture is then represented in an event-driven coupled hidden Markov model (HMM) as a sequence of events, occurring in the various segments and joints. The inherent advantage of using an event-driven coupled-HMM (instead of a pose-driven HMM) is that there is no need to add states to represent more complex gestures or increase the states for addition of another individual. When this model was tested on a library of 185 gestures, created by 7 subjects, the algorithm achieved an average recognition accuracy of 90.2%.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In volume 2, chapter 25, of his capolavoro, The Principles of Psychology, William James discourses on the nature of emotion. He begins with a comparison between emotions and instincts. While every object that excites an instinct can also excite an emotion, the reverse is not the case. Some objects might strike us as hilarious or worthy of deep admiration, to take just two examples, but would not thereby excite in us any of those reflex actions or reactions we call instinctive. In addition, emotional reactions are more internal and physiological than behavioral and practical. They primarily exhibit themselves as a rigidity of this muscle or a relaxation of that one, a constriction of arteries here or a dilation of them there, a quickening of the pulse or a slowing, and so on. These patterns of physiological changes associated with emotion are, of course, also personal and idiosyncratic to a certain extent, like everything else to do with individual humans.",

In everyday life we do not perceive this organic relationship, but only when our chain of actions and patterns is interrupted, suspended or broken. Observing the body actions from the outside we almost always have a feeling of emotional and muscular contact with the person who performs a chain of actions. When, for some reason, an action is interrupted, suspended, diverted or stopped, the production of meaning and sense continues beyond the interruption or breakage. The suspension is, in addition to being an observable motor fact, the sign and the index of other alternative senses. When children point to something without touching it and, at the same time, they observe their father or mother looking for an affective complicity in them; when a young woman performs a performance on the edge of an abyss and places her body in a liminal state; when the actor points out of the scene and looks out into the audience; when the dancer’s body stops and suspends just before finishing a sequence.",

      "title": "Causal Connection of Macro and Micro Systems in Function of Spatial - Temporal Resonance",
      "abstract": "By discovering natural laws, one learns about relatively stable causal connections between objects and phenomena. Causal relations can be functionally connected (when one phenomenon without exception causes another - natural phenomena) and stochastically (connection of phenomena with exceptions - social phenomena). Phenomena in nature are perceived and occurred according to valid laws for all people. However, there are phenomena that are not perceived by all people, they do not have valid laws for everyone, but in certain causally symbolic interpretations, they are valid for certain individuals, who perceive the phenomena and then causally connect them with some of their initiated actions from the past or present, which the outcome they expect. Therefore, these phenomena occur in nature (society), and as a spontaneous response, i.e. anticipating the outcome of actions started but not completed by a certain individual. We cannot mathematically describe the above-mentioned causal relationships, but we interpret them with the aim of anticipating the outcome of the initiated but unfinished actions of individuals. For now, we can believe or not believe in these phenomena and their causally symbolic connections, as well as in theological dogmas, because we are not at the stage of cognitive development to interpret and prove them indisputably. The spatial-temporal synchronicity between natural phenomena that can be scientifically explained and phenomena that have no explanation, we called \"The Kuka - Panovski Resonance\". In that resonance, i.e. natural phenomena with their causally symbolic interpretations, time is extrasensory, infinite and independent of space, and space is sensory and dependent on time. In addition, we have to distinguish time, which we measure through space and movement, from infinite time, i.e., constant present produced by our consciousness. The causal connection of phenomena (action / reaction) in nature, with individual actions which outcome they anticipate, is most often judged \"ex post facto\", i.e. when the outcome of the initiated action has already occurred. However, we start from the premise that in the \"The Kuka - Panovski Resonance\", as well as in the whole of nature, all phenomena and outcomes (actions and reactions) are mutually-causally connected. From this causal connection, we hypothetically assume that spontaneous phenomena in nature (macro, higher system) provide answers in advance, i.e., they anticipate the outcome of the initiated actions of each human (micro, lower system), which is the part of that same nature. It is believed that the visible world is a storehouse of images and signs, which first need to be perceived and then revealed their hidden meaning through the causal symbolic method. The scientist or the artist act in the capacity of translator of that universal analogy. In this work, we shall describe methodologically the phenomena that, according to our knowledge, are in stable causal relationships, which official science does not accept yet. By understanding these phenomena in their stable causal relationships, modern science would take a big step in its future development.",

      "title": "The Ape That Captured Time: Folklore, Narrative, and the Human-Animal Divide",
      "abstract": "This paper is a result of an attempt to answer a simple question, and that is: do animals tell stories? Although at one point the idea might have seemed ludicrous, at least from the standpoint of Western science, recent advances in animal studies have shown that we may now speak of animal language (learned, not innate, symbolic communication) and animal culture (the socially learned aspects of behavior). Faced with these new developments, the question becomes a bit less ludicrous. If animals have language, then do they also have stories?The answer, after a careful review of data, appears to be no. While I will argue that, at least according to all currently available data, nonhominid animals have not been demonstrated to tell stories, what is remarkable is how very close they come, and this brings to light questions as to when and where storytelling first began, as well as what antecedents of storytelling can one find in non-hominids. Such an evolutionary inquiry is not only interesting as a historical exercise, but also holds potential uses towards understanding storytelling, generally. For example, storytelling and narrative comprehension have been noted as key markers of human intellectual development. Usually, children begin experimenting with simple stories around age two or three, and begin to tell competent stories around five or six (Engel 1995). Autism is often closely linked with difficulties in both understanding and telling stories, and a great deal of research on autism and other related developmental conditions has investigated the issue of narrative competence (Dautenhahn 1999, 2003; Reilly, Losh, Bellugi, & Wulfeck 2004; Capps, Losh & Thurber 2000; Losh & Capps 2003; Liles 1993; Loveland, Mcevoy & Tunali 1990; Tager-Flusberg & Sullivan 1995; Tager-Flusberg 1995; Klein, Chan, & Loftus 1999). Understanding the evolutionary history of storytelling, and its relation to other forms of animal communication, may therefore have some very real medical and developmental implications for our own species as well.ANIMALS AND PEOPLEThe history of Western cultures' views on animals is long and complex, but it is safe to say that up until recently science was dismissive of animal intelligence and consciousness. The Cartesian dualistic conception of the mind and body predicated a view of animals as fleshy robots acting instinctively, without feelings, thoughts, memories, or awareness. More recently, new findings have produced new theories, and much of the previously assumed human exceptionalism has been revealed to be instead shared with much of the animal kingdom. Scientists had long declared that only humans used tools, but work from chimps to sea otters and even birds revealed tool use to be much more widespread (Hall 1963). Tool preparation was the new marker for humaniqueness, but this too has been documented in other species (Ingmanson 1996; Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa 1997), even including birds (Chappell and Kacelnik 2003). Animal intelligence studies have documented the stunning closeness of our relation to many other mammals, including social and political considerations (de Waal 2007), socially learned symbolic communications (Crockford et. al, 2004), memories, and even some complex emotions. Chimps outperform humans on some memory tests (Inoue and Matsuzawa 2007). Honeybees early on were shown to use symbolic communication in their dances to communicate the whereabouts of food (von Frisch 1967). Scientific work in animal studies has documented the symbolic, cultural worlds of many non-hominid animals. remember, think, are often curious about novelty, and even have been documented with instances of complex social learning.1THE BANANA CANONIn his article 'Banana Cannon' and Other Folk Traditions Between Human and Nonhuman Animals (1989), Jay Mechling asserted scholars need to rethink the implicit assumption that folklore, as shared traditions, only exists between fellow humans, and he provided compelling evidence of traditions shared across the divide of species, particularly in the traditions such as games shared between pets and their owners. …",

By responsibility is meant the moral (as distinct from the physical) necessity of performing an act. Physical or bodily powers incapable of moral necessity are incapable of responsibility. A power that is incapable of an act may be responsible for an act, if it has (i) physical, (2) psychological, or (3) moral power over another power which is capable of the act. (1) Physical? The human will is not capable of cutting a human throat. A knife is capable of cutting a human throat. But a human will using a knife is responsible for cutting a human throat. In other words a human will has not the capability but has the responsibility of cutting or not cutting a human throat. . (2) Psychological. The feet have the capability of walking but not of hearing or of seeing. The ears have the capability of hearing but not of seeing or of walking. The eyes have the capability of seeing but not of walking or of hearing. The human will has the capability neither of walking nor hearing nor seeing. Now the feet which have the capability of walking are not responsible for walking. The ears which have the capability of hearing are not responsible for hearing. The eyes which have the capability of seeing are not responsible for seeing. But the human will which cannot walk nor hear nor see can move (or not move) the feet to walk, the ear to hear, the eye to see.

Whether he asks for counsel and information regarding his everyday needs or, far beyond any practical considerations, strives for insight, whether his concern is with the first or the last questions, he does only what he cannot leave undone. He can inquire into things ; he can question himself ; he can direct his questions to others or be interrogated by them ; he can run away from perplexing situations or turn his inquisitiveness to the uncovering of problems. In so doing, he only demonstrates and fulfills a basic mode of human existence. When he attempts to evade painful questions, to withdraw from « re-sponsibility », questions follow and pursue him even into sleep. They emerge from his past ; they threaten him from the future ; they haunt him in the present. Questions themselves never disappear, because questioning never ceases. Although particular questions can be transmitted to others and accepted by them as their own, the act of questioning cannot be taught. Nor does it require a teacher. The first question arises early in the life of every healthy child, from the very roots of its existence. We are able to ask single questions because we are questioning beings at our very core. We must therefore distinguish, though not separate, the relationship",

The first is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a sensible or natural being; the second is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a rational being endowed with freedom. The man of principles, from whom one knows what to expect, not from his instinct, for example, but from his will, has a character. – Therefore in the Characteristic one can, without tautology, divide what belongs to a human being's faculty of desire (what is practical) into what is characteristic in a) his natural aptitude or natural predisposition, b) his temperament or sensibility, and c) his character purely and simply, or way of thinking. – The first two predispositions indicate what can be made of the human being; the last (moral) predisposition indicates what he is prepared to make of himself.",

What determines whether you will? Perhaps the most common answer among psychologists is that empathic concern is felt when you adopt the perspective of the person in need (see Batson, 1987; Davis, 1994; Stotland, 1969). But in this answer, what is meant by adopting the person's perspective? First, it is an act of imagination. One does not literally take another person's place or look through his or her eyes. One imagines how things look from the other's point of view. Second, it is not the same as perspective taking in the symbolic-interaction tradition (e.g., Mead, 1934). In that tradition, one adopts the perspective of another—often a significant other—to imaginatively see oneself through the other's eyes (and values). The perspective taking that evokes empathic concern involves imaginatively perceiving the other's situation, not oneself.",

Threats to the infant's psyche and/or physical survival normally mobilize ruthless aggression directed towards the object that is perceived as dangerous. The threat might be experienced as a direct assault, engulfment, smothering, or abandonment to starve. When the line of development from self-preservative aggression to the libidinalization of aggression progresses to the intensification of sadism, the psychic groundwork is laid for the use of sadism as a solution to neurotic or psychotic conflicts. When the mother's sadism fails to defend her against what she experiences as her child's persecution, she is at risk of relying upon ruthless aggression or its psychic equivalent. The child's wellbeing is then no longer relevant to the mother. The mother's only concern is negating or eliminating any aspect of the child that poses a threat to her survival.",

      "title": "Die Rolle der Zeichenmaterialität in Interaktionen zwischen Mensch und Tier",
      "abstract": "The materiality of signs is much more important in interaction with animals than it is in human dialogues. Animals identify familiar humans olfactorily (individual smell), acoustically (voice, pattern of walking), and visually (shape, pattern of motion). For them, the intonation of utterances and the mood of gestures are more expressive than the words or gestures themselves because they inform about the sender’s mood (joy, fear, anger…) and the speech act (praise, warning, order…). Additionally, nose animals smell strong emotions. On the one hand, during their common history, men learned to interpret characteristic expressions of animals like wagging the tail or ruffling feathers. On the other hand, pets and domestic animals understand the facial expressions of men. Further indices of mood are body tension and proxemics. Greetings like giving the paw (dog) and giving the head (cat) come from the natural behavioral repertory and are reciprocated by humans – unlike the equally friendly licking of cows. Signs in a narrow sense are produced in order to communicate specific information to somebody else. Guide dogs, for example, learn numerous orders as well as signs for telling humans something specific. Riding animals and draft animals are guided by shouts (“Giddy up! “) and motoric signals (leg pressure, pull of the rein or guiding rope). A last group of signs are gestures for luring or chasing away which are mostly combined with specific shouts like “Here boy!” or “Pssssst!!!” Die Materialitat von Zeichen ist in der Interaktion mit Tieren viel wichtiger als in zwischenmenschlichen Dialogen. Tiere identifizieren bekannte Menschen olfaktorisch (individueller Geruch), akustisch (Stimme, Gangart) und visuell (Gestalt, Bewegungsmuster). Fur sie sind der Tonfall von Auserungen und die Gestimmtheit von Korperbewegungen aussagekraftiger als die Worte oder Gesten selbst, denn sie informieren uber die derzeitige Stimmung des Senders (Freude, Angst, Arger…) und den Sprechakt (Lob, Warnung, Befehl…). Nasentiere riechen zusatzlich starke Emotionen. Im Laufe ihrer gemeinsamen Geschichte lernten Menschen artspezifische Ausdrucksbewegungen von Tieren (Schwanzwedeln, Federn strauben usw.) zu deuten, umgekehrt verstehen Haus- und Nutztiere die menschliche Mimik. Weitere Anzeichen der Stimmung sind Korperspannung und Distanzverhalten. Grusgesten wie Pfotchengeben (Hund) und Kopfchengeben (Katze) stammen aus dem naturlichen Verhaltensrepertoire und werden – im Gegensatz zum ebenso freundlichen Ablecken von Rindern – vom Menschen erwidert. Echte Zeichen produziert man, um anderen etwas Bestimmtes mitzuteilen. So lernen Blindenhunde zahlreiche Befehle sowie umgekehrt Zeichen, die dem Menschen etwas Bestimmtes mitteilen. Reit- und Zugtiere werden durch Zurufe (“Hu!”) und motorische Hilfen (Schenkeldruck, Zug am Zugel oder Leitseil) gelenkt. Eine letzte Zeichengruppe sind Lock- und Scheuchgesten, die man meist mit artspezifischen Rufen wie “Putt-putt-putt” bzw. “Ksch!!! “ kombiniert.",

In some places we have disturbed the environment so much that ‘undesirable’ plants find it more convenient to grow there than the ‘desirable’ plants.

      "abstract": "My children have never looked much like those described in most theories of cognitive development. I don’t mean that they are generally deviant or that they perform abnormally on conservation or class inclusion tasks. They generally seem more or less normal, and on the few occasions when I have presented tasks from the cognitive developmental literature, they have acted pretty much like the children described in the articles. Where my children are altogether different from the theoretical descriptions is in the variability of their thinking. Cognitive developmental theories generally depict age and thought as proceeding in a 1:1 relation. At an early age, children think in one way; at a later age, they think in another way; at a still later age, they think in a third way. Such descriptions are so pervasive that they begin to feel like reality. Young children are said to form thematic concepts; somewhat older ones to form chain concepts; yet older ones to form true concepts. The reasoning of young children is said to be preoperational; that of somewhat older ones concrete operational; that of yet older ones formal operational. Young children are said to have one theory of mind; somewhat older ones a different, more inclusive theory; yet older ones a more advanced theory still. The story is the same with characterizations of performance on specific tasks. In descriptions of the development of the concept of living things, 3- and 4-yearolds are said to think that anything that moves is alive, 5- to 8-year-olds that animals—and only animals—are alive, and older children that plants as well as animals are alive. In descriptions of the development of addition skill, kindergartners are said to count from one; first through third graders to count from the larger addend; fourth graders and older children to retrieve answers from memory. In descriptions of the development of serial recall strategies, 5-year-olds are said not to rehearse; 8-year-olds to rehearse in a simple way; 11-year-olds to rehearse in a more elaborate way. My children’s thinking has never looked as neat and clean as these 1:1 characterizations of the relation between age and thought.",

      "abstract": "Arguments about the experience of silence may seem contradictory, and perhaps they are. The intention of this contribution is not to give voice to silence, but to give body, weight and importance to silence in the educational experience, in relationships, in reflection, in thinking and acting. I start from the consideration of silence as the of listening and therefore the of a dialogue, not dialectical, but dialogical, with oneself, with the other, with the Cosmos. As a matrix that in-form, silence contains idea and forms, inspiration and creativity, thought and gesture; it takes shape as a space and time that constitute an aesthetic experience, full of knowledge and understanding, meaning and sense, intelligence and sensitivity. Giving body to silence allows us to illuminate the dimension not manifested - but generative - of the relationship and of a communication that is not only transmission and emission, but also listening and receptiveness. It means giving meaning to time, not only as a pressing urging of speed, but as a “in-between” within which to let something happen: a new meaning, a new sense, the discovery of an authentic relationship and a renewed action.",

      "abstract": "Design has a central role in the creation of longer user product relationships. Thus far, however, sustainable design methodologies have attended almost exclusively to the somewhat superficial, bodily survival of manufactured objects, to after-effects rather than causes. Durability is as much about emotion, love and attachment as it is about fractured polymers, worn gaskets or blown circuitry. There is little point designing physical durability into goods if consumers lack the desire to keep them. The scope and power of emotional experiences delivered via objects produced through the current system are incredibly limited. Their ability to support and mediate evolving narrative experiences are weak. Commercially viable strategies are needed for emotionally durable objects which engage users on deeper and more profound levels, delivering intense and sophisticated experiences that penetrate the user psyche over longer, more rewarding, periods of time. New, alternative genres of objects could increase the durability of relationships between users and products, people and things. This will demand novel and provocative models of sustainable design capable of developing emotionally durable objects and empowering consumers to transcend the superficial urgencies of conventional consumerism and forge deep emotive connections with their possessions.",

      "title": "Social Pressure",
      "abstract": "Social Pressure Teresa Brennan 1. Preamble: It has become habitual to think of the social as immaterial or unphysical, as something which does not enter into or physically affect the body. Despite the strong evidence of psychosomatic disorders, or the logical deductions that follow from the facts that words and images are physical entities as well as conveyors of meaning, social theory continues to think the relation between the physical and the social in terms where either the biological may (some claim) or may not determine the social, but where the social does not have material effects on the body. In other words, the only alternative to sociobiology, 1 which misconceives and reduces the relation at issue to one of biological determination, appears to be a social without physical materiality. The theory of social physicality I have developed 2 is premised on the notion that the opposition between the social and the biological is itself misconceived to the extent that it conjures up an idea of the social as immaterial, as lacking matter and/or energy. 3 The opposition between the social and the biological was built into sociology’s foundations: Durkheim for instance, as Giddens has it, is concerned with “the specific characteristics of the class of phenomena which may be delimited as ‘social’ and thereby separated from other categories such the ‘biological’ and ‘psychological’” (Giddens 1971, 86). But while I agree that the social is specific to itself and independent of biology, and that it also exists independently of personal psychology, the social as I will define an aspect of it here (which we will call “social pressure”) is nonetheless physical. Moreover it is not that the biological determines the social. It is rather that the physicality of the social enters into [End Page 257] and even determines biology, and for that matter, the environment. It follows that human organisms will have physical differences consequent on their different “socializations.” 4 In this essay I will elaborate on the theory of social physicality in relation to aging. We are all familiar with the discrepancies between those who age “well” and those who do not, between an apparent retardation of aging and its untimely acceleration. Such discrepancies suggest that a social level impinges on the biological level. At the same time, the fact of aging seems to legitimate the distinction between the social and the biological for the very reason that while some of us age poorly and some well, we all ultimately age. The thing that varies (how we age) is not the same as the thing that is varied (the fact of aging). The fact of aging is presented to us as a biological fact. But my point will be that the social variations or accelerations and retardations in how we age, while biological in their effects, have to have a material existence that involves something more than somatic biology. The nature of that material existence, I will suggest here, is physical. Thus it may be that the “social” which affects the body can be understood in terms of physics (this is what social physicality is about); while the body of course belongs to biology. In other words, what I am suggesting is that we reflect on the appositeness of the distinction between the biological and the physical in rethinking an issue which otherwise remains intractable. If I am right in this approach, it would be more correct to say not that a critical dimension of the social is biological, but that it is physical, a force that interacts with and affects the biological body. The distinction between the physical and the biological, while frequently collapsed in the humanities and social sciences, is long-standing. 5 But the distinction is needed in the social sciences. Apart from its use in explaining changes in the organism that are not consequent solely on biological developments, the distinction is necessary if one is to resolve a paradox: as Ingold points out, “biology” is meant to be about the increasing differentiation of forms, and how organisms grow in distinctiveness (1990, 214). I add that socialization by contrast is about how these organisms conform to common [End Page 258] modes of behavior and...",

      "title": "The Development of Anthropomorphism in Interaction: Intersubjectivity, Imagination, and Theory of Mind",
      "abstract": "Human beings frequently attribute anthropomorphic features, motivations and behaviors to animals, artifacts, and natural phenomena. Historically, many interpretations of this attitude have been provided within different disciplines. What most interpretations have in common is distinguishing children's manifestations of this attitude, which are considered \"natural\", from adults' occurrences, which must be explained by resorting to particular circumstances. In this article, I argue that anthropomorphism is not grounded in specific belief systems but rather in interaction. In interaction, a nonhuman entity assumes a place that generally is attributed to a human interlocutor, which means that it is independent of the beliefs that people may have about the nature and features of the entities that are anthropomorphized. This perspective allows us to explain the problems that emerge if we consider anthropomorphism as a belief: (i) adults under certain circumstances may anthropomorphize entities even if they perfectly know that these entities have no mental life; (ii) according to the situation, the same entity may be anthropomorphized or treated as an object; (iii) there is no consistency among the entities that are anthropomorphized; (iv) there is individual variability in anthropomorphization, and this variability derives from affective states rather than from different degrees of knowledge about the entity that is anthropomorphized or greater or lesser naivety of the person who anthropomorphizes. From this perspective, anthropomorphism is a basic human attitude that begins in infants and persists throughout life. The difference between adults and children is not qualitative but rather a matter of complexity.",

      "abstract": "Human situation is a constant one. New conditions and problems are constantly setting the individual right from his infancy to his deathbed, and he is invariably engaged in trying to find a satisfactory and pleasurable solution to them by employing his intelligence and other gifts of the mind and body. In other words, life is the name of unceasing process, the process of adjustment. “Adjustment is the process by which a living organism maintains a balance between its needs and the circumstances that influence the satisfaction of these needs” accordingly, the process of adjustment has two primary or main elements: one, the needs of the living organism; and two the conditions of circumstances influencing these needs. These needs can be biogenic, Originating in the society, personal or community, or arising from any other conceivable source. On the other hand, circumstances influencing these needs also can be either inside individual or outside him. Factors within the individuals that influence these needs are his physical and mental states, capacity, attitudes interests, etc. Three Elements in Adjustment An analysis of the process of adjustment of the processes of adjustment will reveal the presence of three main elements: - Motive: The very process of adjustment in the living being is set in motion by the presence within him of some motive or need or requirement. - Thwarting Condition: When the environment does not present any features that tend to become obstacles in the fulfillment of these needs, then the adjustment in natural, facile and effortless, and does not problem in result. However, if circumstances create obstacle in the path of such fulfillment, then the process of adjustment progresses further. -  Varied Responses :  Once the fulfillment of a need has obstructed, individual indulges in various actions, which are a reaction to the obstacle. Such a reaction can be normal just as much as it can be abnormal. -  Solution: Because of these reactions and responses, the individual achieves a degree of adjustment with the circumstances. The problem of adjustment in there by solved. - Motive and adjustment :  Generally speaking, the process of adjustment can be set in motion by any motive.  For example, our physical needs are constantly being manifesting in the form of adjective behavior patterns. However, from our point of view, these needs do not have much importance, for life, itself ceases in the organism, thus obviating all further adjustment activity. Need of study : - present time all people are salves of their problem in presently situations and his determinative life goals. Present time all people have set their life goals to earn a lot of money. In Past time all human being decided his life goal “mocha”. The persons do efforts to gain a lot of money in any situation or from any work .All situation have balanced human behaviors; this work’s main factor is adjustment level. Based on previous research finding conclusion the well adjustable persons have conducted their work very smoothly, and all decisions taken were correct.  From This concepts question arises. What does high adjustment level students achieved on high academic achievement?   Adjustment works normally in every circumstance of human life. Similarly, adjustments on learning achievement would work normally, considering how logical this fact is this study has done. Statement of the problem : - “A comparative study of academic achievement of high and low adjustment level students”",

In primitive communities, when holding together and wrestling with a combined effort against natural adversities or rival tribes, each individual acquires a homogeneous basis of habits in doing and thinking which become irrefutable matters of course.--In case of economical surplus consolidation of bigger social units gets under way.--That leads step by step--starting always from pioneering élites--in the course of many generations to increasing awareness in the conduct of life and at the same time to dwindling of the emotionally fixed matters of course. In the final stage of evolution, therefore, everyone should consequently acquire for himself a framework of habits and attitudes, representing a compromise between selfish and altruistic tendencies and granting his thoughts and actions steadiness, assurance, and self-confidence.--If, however, owing to affluence, adverse living conditions do not force joint exertions and concord, individualistic expansion, competition, and rivalry arise and undermine the human relations. As a result increasingly self-realization is claimed to the debit of the fellow-men. But in view of the fact that the individual as a gregarious being cannot exist without trustworthy social ties and esteem, a rising number of men comes into a conflict between individualistic desire for expansion and yearning for the security of a community.

      "title": "The primacy of social over visual perspective-taking",
      "abstract": "In this article, we argue for the developmental primacy of social over visual perspective-taking. In our terminology, social perspective-taking involves some understanding of another person's preferences, goals, intentions etc. which can be discerned from temporally extended interactions, including dialogue. As is evidenced by their successful performance on various reference disambiguation tasks, infants in their second year of life first begin to develop such skills. They can, for example, determine which of two or more objects another is referring to based on previously expressed preferences or the distinct quality with which these objects were jointly explored. The pattern of findings from developmental research further indicates that this ability emerges sooner than analogous forms of visual perspective-taking. Our explanatory account of this developmental sequence highlights the primary importance of joint attention and the formation of common ground with others. Before children can develop an awareness of what exactly is seen or how an object appears from a particular viewpoint, they must learn to share attention and build common \"experiential\" ground. Learning about others' as well as one's own \"snapshot\" perspectives in a literal, i.e., optical sense of the term, is a secondary step that affords an abstraction from all (prior) pragmatic involvement with objects.",

For us to be able to do this, there must exist an interdependence between the two – we must be able to map whatever representations are evoked by experiencing the world directly onto whatever representations are evoked by hearing (or reading) a description of that world. With respect to language acquisition, it is commonly believed that the interpretation of structure in language and of structure in the world are mutually constraining – without that mutual constraint we could not learn the meanings of verbs or the significance of different sentential structures (e.g., Fisher, Hall, Rakowitz, & Gleitman, 1994; Gleitman, Gleitman, Landau, & Wanner, 1988). Unless our language processing system somehow metamorphoses into an adult state that bears no relationship whatsoever to its younger self, adult sentence processing must respect the interdependence between sentences in the language and events in the world. The process of sentence interpretation is nothing more than the realization of that interdependence, and the realization of the mapping between sentential input and the mental world.",

We will present some illustrations, in the field of the phenomeno-structural method, which, after having dedicated an important part of its works to the enlightment of the organization of the mental structure, from 1920 to 1950, felt the need, from the 50's onwards, to follow its evolution through a set of psychological modifications pointing in a main direction: during normal and pathological development throughout childhood or at the critical moment of the adolescence period, in psychosurgery or psychobiological practices, then in cases of appearing and disappearing of delusional processes, in the follow-up of determining transformation phases during alcoholic detoxification, or, more recently, in the appreciation of the psychotherapeutic practices (directed daydream, relaxation). We will show how this perspective, standing apart and suspicious to the restrictive current tendency towards evaluation, takes part in a much wider theoretical and methodological frame with a constant concern to consider the sustainable effects and the limits of various events, circumstances or procedures on the structure of personality, through a vast and coherent understanding of the underlying psychological mechanisms which steer them by giving them sense.",

Abandonment, even when only temporary, was a traumatic experience for study participants associated with feelings of loss and guilt. The distinction between participation and abandonment is not entirely clear. Abandonment is complex and may be short-lived, longer-lasting, or permanent. It is also multidimensional. While it is obviously displayed by a physical abstention or exclusion from the activity, for many participants this was merely the outward manifestation of abandonment, and they retained their inner identities as participants. Sometimes physical involvement in the activity was substituted by a more cerebral, social, or institutional involvement. The study supports and builds upon Stebbins's (2008) typology of abandonment and poses the notion that multiple antecedents can be operative for any one abandonment experience.",

      "title": "Collective intentionality",
      "abstract": "Suppose two persons plan to carry a table upstairs together. Their plan will consist of their intentions to carry the table together and their shared beliefs concerning how to do it. There is joint or collective intentionality here about the joint action of carrying the table and about the means for doing it. Thus there is collective intentionality or aboutness related to intending and believing. In the case of joint intending the relevant part of the world has to be (jointly) changed to accord with the content of the intention for it to be satisfied. Thus the satisfaction relation here has the world-to-mind direction of fit. In the case of shared or mutual belief the correctness of the belief is determined on the basis of what the world is like and the direction of fit is mind-to-world (cf. Searle, 1983 and 2001 for this kind of account). In the \"fitness\" relation the first term is the variable and the second one the constant factor in the situation. We may speak of collective intentionality also in the case of emotions like joy, fear, and shame.",

      "abstract": "In ordinary daily life we often say one thing and think another: “Do you mind?” when we think “How dare you!,” “You're looking fine” when we think “He is getting old.” Our social behavior is one truth about us, but there is another which our words and actions seldom display directly: if our acquaintances know anything of this, they have usually inferred it from tones of voice, physical reactions, peculiar emphases or hesitations, apparently meaningless mannerisms. Yet, paradoxically, this indirect impression can be the strongest and most lasting, our unspoken nervousness or confidence making a greater effect than considered conversation. And sometimes the indirect impression is one we do not take into account ourselves; perhaps some person arouses a reaction which we have never recognized in ourselves, or a situation makes us more afraid than we are able to admit. But even so, others may observe our changed behavior, for the effect we make individually is both direct and indirect, conscious and subconscious.",

Explaining life and its origin is rich in paradoxes and far from denitive (Bedau, 1998). From a theoretical and technical standpoint, life may only exist in systems that are dynamic and very complex (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984; Kauman, 1993). us, asking that a denition for life should be at the same time brief, popular, and scientically accurate is wrong. Most dictionary-like abbreviated definitions or colloquial denitions of life are too truncated or too simplistic to be acceptable. ey may serve but a segment of the public and certainly not the specialist. An acceptable denition for life cannot be constrained for size or simplistic on purpose. It will be in the form of a description of the essence and fundamental properties of life and will be tailored to a specic purpose and target audience. It is also possible that a denition of life is not something that a person with inadequate academic training can be briefed about in a rush, that is, \"Life is not something that can be told about, it may have to be taught.\"",

      "abstract": "Abstract Percipience involves the exercise of judgment and reasoning in relation to perception. All animals rely on direct, causal interaction with their environment to endorse the perceptual predication of properties to objects; all shift attention sub-intentionally, often in pursuit of other intentional goals; and all dismiss or neglect perceptions that prove behaviorally misleading. But equipped with percipience, the humanoids can increase the range of properties perceived, can regulate their attention intentionally in seeking the answers to various questions, and can judge and believe that things are not as they are perceived to be rather than investing perception with unquestioned authority: they can distinguish appearance from reality, finding their way to aesthetic appreciation and speculative thought. Percipience can also enhance the awareness of what they perceive, which they share with the non-percipient, transforming their consciousness-in-perception. And it can enable them, unlike other perceivers, to enjoy consciousness-of-perception: to be able to recognize as such the perceptual states in which their world is presented, and possibly mis-presented, to them.",

The goal of the extension was to locate stimulus and subject parameters which might influence the relative strength of these two processes: self-persuasion from behavior or judgments based upon changing stimulus attributes. High tolerance subjects are expected to show the self-persuasion effect; they are relatively unafraid and insensitive to shock. Their escape behavior is likely to be salient to them. Self-persuasion from one's instrumental escape behavior occurs only for high-shock-tolerance subjects. Low-tolerance subjects show an opposite pattern—after choosing to escape a shock they rate it as less uncomfortable than a shock which is escaped without choice. The low tolerance subjects are relatively fearful and sensitive to the pain of shock. Thus, when the shock is escaped by choice one expects them to feel less discomfort than when the shock is terminated by chance.",

      "abstract": "Life’s journey is analyzed as a result of the transition from long-range goals and plans into the history of life, organized and regulated by a person as a subject of life. Based on the contextual-level model of the value-conceptual organization of life activity, we distinguish functional and structural units of life regulation (act, activity, communication, sphere of life, life as a whole, and life of event community), which form regulatory contours of different scales and differentiate the conception of the object of regulation. We use the principle of self-motion of any form of activity towards life activity, which allows us to consider life activity as a unity of, on the one hand, regulation and self-regulation processes and, on the other hand, organization and self-organization processes united in an open regulatory contour model. We show specific features of goals functioning in the over-activity life regulation contours. These goals exist in the form of generalized value-conceptual formations, which do not have unambiguous sensual representation and therefore do not give clear and definite criteria for their achievement; they often exist in a subconscious form. This determines the nature of the feedback, setting two modes of the open regulatory contour: 1) the mode of regulation and self-regulation based on the negative feedback through the correction of the implementation; 2) the mode of organization and self-organization based on the positive feedback through the correction (transformation) of the goals. A direct experience serves in this case as a feedback carrier-process. It summarizes various estimates of human self-realization process in regulatory contours of different scales and makes them conscious.",

This patholgical experience was analysed in comparison with that in one case reported in Japan.1) The patient could actually see his own thoughts or images which occurred in his mind and could change the scene or the things seen in front of his eyes according to his own will. However, he could not recognize things seen as they existed in the real world, nor see highly abstract ideas such as philosophy, realism, etc.2) The experience of the seeing of his own thoughts was considered to be an eidetic image, but he did not appear to be a man with an eidetic disposition.3) Upward eye movements were observed concomitant with the seeing of his own thoughts. However, such eye movements did not occur at the time when he did not experience such visions. Duning close observation for over 2.5 years, there was an apparent relationship between the pathological experience of these visions and the eye movements.4) A large nystagmus to the left was apparent regardless of the absence or presence of the vision.5) The slow eye deviation in the OKP test was inhibited when he experienced the seeing of his own thoughts, but was normally produced when he did not have such experiences. Smooth pursuit in the eye tracking test and normal responses in the caloric test were obtained regardless.These findings suggest that the pathological experience of the seeing of his own thoughts is closely related to abnormal functions of the oculomotor system.",

      "abstract": "One reason that theories of mental illness have made little progress may be their focus on individuals, omitting the social/relational and emotional world. Adding these components will be difficult, however: in modern societies they have become virtually invisible, particularly the emotion of shame. The theory outlined here is based on the work of Cooley, Elias, Lewis and Goffman: shame is both social and individual and, if anticipation is included, virtually omnipresent in modern societies. It is proposed that most symptoms of mental illness are products of shame and relational feedback loops: emotion and alienation can both spiral leading to further alienation and chaotic or hidden emotions. Almost everyone is especially ashamed of their shame. Being ashamed of one's shame and/or anger can spiral when not acknowledged. Under certain conditions, these spirals continue without limit, generating immense force for acting out symptoms or depression. To the extent that this theory is true, we would need to rename the field using non-medical terms, such as emotional/social dysfunction.",

      "title": "NEAR‐DEATH EXPERIENCES AND SPIRITUALITY",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Some individuals when they come close to death report having experiences that they interpret as spiritual or religious. These so‐called near‐death experiences (NDEs) often include a sense of separation from the physical body and encounters with religious figures and a mystical or divine presence. They share with mystical experiences a sense of cosmic unity or oneness, transcendence of time and space, deeply felt positive mood, sense of sacredness, noetic quality or intuitive illumination, paradoxicality, ineffability, transiency, and persistent positive aftereffects. Although there is no relationship between NDEs and religious belief prior to the experience, there are strong associations between depth of NDE and religious change after the experience. NDEs often change experiencers' values, decreasing their fear of death and giving their lives new meaning. NDEs lead to a shift from ego‐centered to other‐centered consciousness, disposition to love unconditionally, heightened empathy, decreased interest in status symbols and material possessions, reduced fear of death, and deepened spiritual consciousness. Many experiencers become more empathic and spiritually oriented and express the beliefs that death is not fearsome, that life continues beyond, that love is more important than material possessions, and that everything happens for a reason. These changes meet the definition of spiritual transformation as “a dramatic change in religious belief, attitude, and behavior that occurs over a relatively short period of time.” NDEs do not necessarily promote any one particular religious or spiritual tradition over others, but they do foster general spiritual growth both in the experiencers themselves and in human society at large.",

      "title": "Joyful by nature: approaches to investigate the evolution and function of joy in non‐human animals",
      "abstract": "The nature and evolution of positive emotion is a major question remaining unanswered in science and philosophy. The study of feelings and emotions in humans and animals is dominated by discussion of affective states that have negative valence. Given the clinical and social significance of negative affect, such as depression, it is unsurprising that these emotions have received more attention from scientists. Compared to negative emotions, such as fear that leads to fleeing or avoidance, positive emotions are less likely to result in specific, identifiable, behaviours being expressed by an animal. This makes it particularly challenging to quantify and study positive affect. However, bursts of intense positive emotion (joy) are more likely to be accompanied by externally visible markers, like vocalisations or movement patterns, which make it more amenable to scientific study and more resilient to concerns about anthropomorphism. We define joy as intense, brief, and event-driven (i.e. a response to something), which permits investigation into how animals react to a variety of situations that would provoke joy in humans. This means that behavioural correlates of joy are measurable, either through newly discovered 'laughter' vocalisations, increases in play behaviour, or reactions to cognitive bias tests that can be used across species. There are a range of potential situations that cause joy in humans that have not been studied in other animals, such as whether animals feel joy on sunny days, when they accomplish a difficult feat, or when they are reunited with a familiar companion after a prolonged absence. Observations of species-specific calls and play behaviour can be combined with biometric markers and reactions to ambiguous stimuli in order to enable comparisons of affect between phylogenetically distant taxonomic groups. Identifying positive affect is also important for animal welfare because knowledge of positive emotional states would allow us to monitor animal well-being better. Additionally, measuring if phylogenetically and ecologically distant animals play more, laugh more, or act more optimistically after certain kinds of experiences will also provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of joy and other positive emotions, and potentially even into the evolution of consciousness.",

As in every science, basic behavioral research is concerned with phenomena that are available to everyday observation. Everybody knows that people learn, that they remember, that symbols play important roles in our lives, that rewards and punishments influence what we do, that we interact socially, that we communicate through spoken and written words, and so on. These phenomena are as obvious to everybody as the rising and setting of the sun, the relation between clouds and rain, the dependence of life upon food, the fall of unsupported objects, and so on. Science does not accept the everyday descriptive language or the everyday techniques of observation that such phenomena have generated, but no science that ignores the phenomena and language of everyday life will keep on receiving public support. A science of behavior analysis must continue to derive its inspiration for basic research from phenomena that we observe outside the laboratory.",

      "title": "Five-Factor Model of Personality",
      "abstract": "The five-factor model of personality (FFM) is a set of five broad trait dimensions or domains, often referred to as the “Big Five”: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism (sometimes named by its polar opposite, Emotional Stability), and Openness to Experience (sometimes named Intellect). Highly extraverted individuals are assertive and sociable, rather than quiet and reserved. Agreeable individuals are cooperative and polite, rather than antagonistic and rude. Conscientious individuals are task focused and orderly, rather than distractible and disorganized. Neurotic individuals are prone to experiencing negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and irritation, rather than being emotionally resilient. Finally, highly open individuals have a broad rather than narrow range of interests, are sensitive rather than indifferent to art and beauty, and prefer novelty to routine. The Big Five/FFM was developed to represent as much of the variability in individuals’ personalities as possible, using only a small set of trait dimensions. Many personality psychologists agree that its five domains capture the most important, basic individual differences in personality traits and that many alternative trait models can be conceptualized in terms of the Big Five/FFM structure. The goal of this article is to reference, organize, and comment on a variety of classic and contemporary papers related to the Big Five/FFM. This article begins with papers that introduce the Big Five/FFM structure, approach it from different theoretical perspectives, and consider possible objections to it (General Overviews, Theoretical Perspectives, and Critiques). Next, it discusses papers providing evidence for the Big Five/FFM as a model of basic trait structure (Big Five/FFM Structure). Third, the article considers hierarchical trait models that propose even broader personality dimensions “above” the Big Five, or more-specific traits “beneath” the Big Five (Big Five/FFM in Hierarchical Context). Fourth, it references a series of handbook chapters that each considers an individual Big Five domain in depth (Individual Domains). Fifth, it references several widely used Big Five/FFM measures as well as papers examining the accuracy of Big Five self-reports and observer-reports (Measurement). Sixth, the article discusses the biological and social origins of the Big Five (Biological and Social Bases). Seventh, the article considers stability and change in the Big Five across the life span as well as the developmental mechanisms underlying stability and change (Development). Finally, this article cites evidence that the Big Five influences a variety of important behaviors and life outcomes, from political attitudes to psychopathology (Predicting Behaviors and Life Outcomes).",

      "abstract": "Standard definitions posit the sign as a discrete entity in relation with other signs and standing for an object (either physical or psychological). Thus the sign has two roles, as prompt and as substitutive representation. The latter raises difficult questions about the relationship of the semiotic to the non-semiotic or pre-semiotic, which can be resolved logically (as in Peirce) or rejected as unanswerable (as in Saussure), but which can never be satisfactorily resolved empirically as the phenomenal cannot be divorced from the semiotic. This impasse can be resolved if we drop the assumption that the sign is essentially substitutive. The assumption of discrete entities, at either the phenomenal or the noumenal levels, is a function of discredited substance metaphysics. On a process metaphysical account, the reality of the sign is not attached to the discreteness of any pre-existing entity. The sign remains as prompt and as relational but not (other than sometimes with respect to other signs) substitutive. Rather than defined as standing for an object, the sign can now be regarded much more simply as a feature of an event. This conception of the sign is explored in terms of its implications for teaching and learning.",

      "abstract": "Along with a classical immune system, we have evolved a behavioral one that directs us away from potentially contagious individuals. Here I show, using publicly available cross-cultural data, that this adaptation is so fundamental that our first impressions of a male stranger are largely driven by the perceived health of his face. Positive (likeable, capable, intelligent, trustworthy) and negative (unfriendly, ignorant, lazy) first impressions are affected by facial health in adaptively different ways, inconsistent with a mere halo effect; they are also modulated by one's current state of health and inclination to feel disgusted by pathogens. These findings, which replicated across two countries as different as the USA and India, suggest that instinctive perceptions of badness and goodness from faces are not two sides of the same coin but reflect the (nonsymmetrical) expected costs and benefits of interaction. Apparently, pathogens run the show-and first impressions come second. Lay Summary: Our first impressions of strangers (whether they seem trustworthy, intelligent, unfriendly, or aggressive) are shaped by how healthy their faces look and by our unconscious motivation to avoid infections. Bad and good impressions turn out to reflect the concrete, potentially vital, expected costs and benefits of interacting with our fellow humans. Apparently, pathogens run the show-and first impressions come second.",

It is hard to believe that intellectual, emotional, and social differences are not based on qualities inherent in the nervous system (reacting of course with social and physical environment) and so can be passed on by inheritance and modified by selection. The only alternative is to suppose that die Creator standardized his invention at the start and has not since let selection work. None of this implies that racial differences imply moral superiority. The strongest contender for die proposition that all men are equal would not claim diat all footballers are equal. It is not immoral to inquire why one footballer is better than another, or why men (on the average) can run faster than women. It is not wicked to ask whether diere are more, orfewer, potential poets ormathematicians amongAfrican childrendian among European ones, or whedier the poets ormadiematicians, when diey mature, will be radier different or kind. It takes all kinds to make a world; it would be a pity to insist, ifall men are not equal at everything, that the differences must be ironed out or hushed up. That seems to me dishonest. So, I support your determination, as St. Paul advised, to \"prove\" (i.e., test) all things and hold fast that which is good (and honest). A. V. Hill 11A Chaucer Road Cambridge, England 475 ...",

      "abstract": "We all live by images that are in part myths. The mythical quality of our images of family life stems from two sources. First, the image is idealized and thus never completely attainable; and secondly, the image is partially fictive, thus never exactly representative of reality. Myths are used to guide, judge, and rationalize behavior. Daily life never completely corresponds to the myths one holds; there are only degrees of approximation. The irony is that it is as impossible to live without myths as it is to live with them. Thus, we should not expect to eliminate myths entirely; rather, prevalent myths should be abandoned and replaced with new ones at those points in history when new circumstances and events render too great a breach between approximation and attainment, when actual behavior deviates too far from prevalent myths, and when new views of reality seem more relevant, appropriate, and explanatory for our time. The recent emergence of experimental variant family forms suggests that we have arrived at such a point in history. The myth of the idealized nuclear family has become untenable for an undetermined proportion of our society, including both those individuals living in nuclear families and those opting for experimental variant family forms. Some hold to the idealized image but, uncomfortable with the behavior expectations it carries, feel guilty or demeaned by their behavior and actions and in somie cases live clandestine second lives. Others speak out against this particular myth and are more candid and",

For example, people vary widely in how much visual imagery they experience. But those who cannot see in their mind’s eye, tend to assume everyone is like them. Those who can, assume everyone else can as well. We argue that a study of such hidden phenomenal differences has much to teach cognitive science. Uncovering and describing this variation (a search for unknown unknowns) may help predict otherwise puzzling differences in human behavior. The very existence of certain differences can also act as a stress test for some cognitive theories. Finally, studying hidden phenomenal differences is the first step toward understanding what kinds of environments may mask or unmask links between phenomenal experience and observable behavior.",

Universals would not be mere playthings for typologists – call them “crosslinguistic descriptive generalisations” for respectability, but never mind what they mean. To have or not to have universals is no petty matter: at issue is the human mind and its history. Universals would be enforcing certain options, categorically or preferentially, and ruling out or disfavouring others as linguistic know-how is transmitted across generations and perhaps overhauled or impaired over the life spans of individuals. Everywhere and at all times, they would thus be superintending the construction of mental lexicons-andgrammars on the basis of the linguistic experience of the members of speech communities, in accordance with what the human brain, and those other parts of human bodies involved in the expression and perception of thought for purposes of communication, can and cannot do (well). Without universals, mental lexicons-and-grammars and the speech acts performed accordingly, and minds insofar as they are tied up with language, would be more diverse than they are and conceivably could be.1 Let me illustrate, chiefly, with adpositions and the ordering inside adpositional phrases, one of the structures figuring in Dunn, Greenhill, Levinson & Gray 2011, where the existence of universals has recently been contested, causing a similar stir as the more expansive universals bashing of Evans & Levinson (2009).

      "abstract": "Experiences of gradually recovering lost memories may shed some light on the cognitive mechanism underlying remembering. We (1) easily remember the external frame (the context) of the lost memory; (2) experience the emergence of its internal frame (category or genre); (3) recall its configuration, its rhythmic skeleton or its dynamic structure; (4) and even sketch it by a gesture; (5) recall our evaluation of the person or our impression of the event we cannot remember; (6) find the central object may emerge in a disguised (symbolic) form; (7) find the abortive first attempt to reconstruct the lost memory may contain an unconscious interpretation of the hidden event or the forgotten dream. Gradual remembering follows on the whole the path of verbal evolution. Trying to recapture lost memories we are compelled to make use of preverbal forms of mental elaboration and expression (visual thinking, gesture language, symbols). At the same time, recovery of lost memories has much in common with the procedure of scientific discovery. Discovery could be considered as a paradoxical form of remembering: recovering the unknown. Scientific metaphors uncover ('remember') preconscious and unconscious knowledge. In his studies on Farkas Bólyai, Imre Hermann made an attempt to interpret scientific theories much in the same way that Freud, Jones, Rank, Reik, Hanns Sachs, Róheim analysed myths, rituals, literary and artistic works. He traces back some essential features of Bólyai's discovery to repressed early memories and fantasies of the great mathematician.",

      "title": "The sciences on mental order/disorder and related concepts Normality, meaning, natural and social norms",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mental disorder and related concepts such as normality, function and meaning are the subject matter of sciences ranging from biology though to sociology, and the next broad topic, for Chapter 2, is what they have to say about them. Three points are noted about the sciences ‘basic to psychiatry’, including psychology, neuroscience and genetics. First, they search for causes of the conditions of interest, typically as defined by the psychiatric manuals; second, for this purpose it is immaterial whether these conditions are considered as disorders or not, and third, at least two of them – psychology and genetics – tend to be antithetical to the notion of disorder as discontinuous with the normal, or as meaningless/non-functional. Another basic science considered, neuroscience, has no notion of order/disorder independent of what derives from the distinction drawn at the psychological/behavioural level. In current models of psychopathology constructed in these basic sciences it is notable that meaningful/functional strategies typically play crucial roles, sometimes alongside other causal factors, including brain disease or lesion, or genetically based temperamental characteristics. These two characteristic features of the current science – that meaning has a causal role, and explanatory pluralism – are both signs of a paradigm shift that has been in progress roughly since the middle of the last century and which is crucial for the line of thought about mental disorder being pursued in this essay.The next main theme in Chapter 2 is that increasingly the biobehavioural sciences are embedded in evolutionary theory. From an evolutionary point of view, what stands out is the essential linkage between behaviour and specific environments and task demands, and the process of more or less successful adaptation to more or less benign or adverse environments. In this context, what sense can be made of mental disorder? While behaviour may be more or less adaptive relative to specific environments and task demands, and this for a variety of reasons, the idea that some behaviour is just ‘disordered’ has no clear rationale. Beyond the behavioural and brain sciences, the social sciences abound with theories of social functions and order, providing further scope for understanding what mental disorder may be. Sociological theories of mental disorder are relatively rare but they were prominent in the 1960s critiques of psychiatry and their influence continues. The sociological theories naturally tended to construe mental disorder as a kind of social deviance. This has much to be said for it, but it passes over distinctions among kinds of social deviance, some attributed to issues such as criminal intent and others to mental disorder, and it also passes over distinctions within mental disorders, in particular between the ‘behavioural’ disorders associated with antisocial activity, and emotional and other disorders that are characterized more by high levels of personal misery and help-seeking. A related problem is that problems at the individual level are not the focus of – are invisible to – social science and for this reason its grasp of what psychological dysfunction means is limited.Having reviewed some main approaches of the sciences to concepts involved in mental disorder, Chapter 2 concludes with considering the norms which demarcate order from disorder, and specifically the validity of the old natural/social distinction. On this topic the basic sciences have not much to say: they are interested in causes, not norms. Norms of function can be defined in an evolutionary theoretic framework, but here the ‘naturally evolved’ and the ‘social’ are blurred, and both of these factors also involve individual differences. There are three kinds of factor involved in the design of human action – the evolutionary biological, the cultural, and individual agency – and each of them corresponds to a way of interpreting function and dysfunction, and hence order and disorder.",

There is a stock of knowledge theoretically available to everyone, built up by practical experience, science, and technology as warranted insights. But this stock of knowledge is not integrated. It consists of a mere juxtaposition of more or less coherent systems of knowledge which themselves are neither coherent nor even compatible with one another. On the contrary, the abysses between the various attitudes involved in the approach to the specialized systems are themselves a condition of the success of the specialized inquiry. If this is true for the various fields of scientific inquiry it is for even better reasons valid for the various fields of practical activity. Where our practical interests predominate we are satisfied with our knowledge that certain means and procedures achieve certain desired or undesired results. The fact that we do not understand the Why and the How of their working and that we do not know anything of their origin does not hinder us from dealing undisturbed with situations, things, and persons. We use the most complicated gadgets prepared by a very advanced technology without knowing how the contrivances work. No car driver is supposed to be familiar with the laws of mechanics, no radio listener with those of electronics. One may even be a successful businessman without an insight into the functioning of the market, or a banker without a smattering of monetary theory.

      "abstract": "Humans work, rest and play in immensely varied extreme environments. The term 'extreme' typically refers to insufficiency or excess of one or more stressors, such as thermal energy or gravity. Individuals' behavioural and physiological capacity to endure and enjoy such environments varies immensely. Adverse effects of acute exposure to these environments are readily identifiable (e.g. heat stroke or bone fracture), whereas adverse effects of chronic exposure (e.g. stress fractures or osteoporosis) may be as important but much less discernable. Modern societies have increasingly sought to protect people from such stressors and, in that way, minimise their adverse effects. Regulations are thus established, and advice is provided on what is 'acceptable' exposure. Examples include work/rest cycles in the heat, hydration regimes, rates of ascent to and duration of stay at altitude and diving depth. While usually valuable and well intentioned, it is important to realise the breadth and importance of limitations associated with such guidelines. Regulations and advisories leave less room for self-determination, learning and perhaps adaptation. Regulations based on stress (e.g. work/rest cycles relative to WBGT) are more practical but less direct than those based on strain (e.g. core temperature), but even the latter can be substantively limited (e.g. by lack of criterion validation and allowance for behavioural regulation in the research on which they are based). Extreme Physiology & Medicine is publishing a series of reviews aimed at critically examining the issues involved with self- versus regulation-controlled human movement acutely and chronically in extreme environments. These papers, arising from a research symposium in 2013, are about the impact of people engaging in such environments and the effect of rules and guidelines on their safety, enjoyment, autonomy and productivity. The reviews will cover occupational heat stress, sporting heat stress, hydration, diving, extreme loading, chronic unloading and high altitude. Ramifications include factors such as health and safety, productivity, enjoyment and autonomy, acute and chronic protection and optimising adaptation.",

Although our own bodies are in the background during much of our ordinary activity, serving simply as vehicles for our movements and interactions, there are many circumstances when they do become the intentional focus of conscious attention and we represent them explicitly and reflect on them. For example, we attend to our body size when we decide whether a chosen shirt or pair of pants is likely to be too small or too large; we carefully arrange our bodies and body parts in specific, sometimes atypical ways as we learn a new golf stroke or T'ai Chi form; we adjust our body's movements and posture deliberately to relay meaningful information non-verbally, including shared understandings; we change our body's appearance by intentionally concealing, adorning, or marking parts of it to enhance self-presentation; we use our bodies strategically as assistive devices or tools when we lean into something to move it or perch our children on our shoulders so they can see better; and we often evaluate the integrity, function, or appearance of our bodies, whether in action or at rest. Thus, we purposely configure and alter our bodies and body parts for particular purposes as we consciously engage the social and physical world. We voluntarily attend to and represent our bodies objectively, forming explicit concepts, beliefs, attitudes, and feelings about their physical characteristics and functional capabilities.

Even intellectual contemplation requires the presence of suitable objects for thought. But this condition, as Plato saw, would rarely, if ever, fail to be met on account of contingencies of circumstance.

      "abstract": "Humans create social closeness with one another through a variety of shared social activities in which they align their emotions or mental states towards an external stimulus such as dancing to music together, playing board games together or even engaging in minimal shared experiences such as watching a movie together. Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (study 1) and a conspecific (study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster (study 1) or spend more time in their proximity (study 2) than when they had attended to something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is present in both humans and great apes, and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected.",

      "abstract": "Whenever one person does something in the expectation that another will then do something else, there arises, given the nature of people and time, a potential problem: the other person might not.Both this expectation and its defeat are life experiences which transcend any legal context.In no society, so far as I know, is it expected that all such expectations will be or even ought to be fulfilled, certainly not through the application of social force.If you love in order to be loved, for instance, you will have to bear, without even much in the way of clucking sympathy, your inevitable disappointments.In a modem trading society like ours, however, where there are numerous credit transactions, where numberless persons do things in exchange for others' promises to do something else thereafter, there necessarily grow up mechanisms to deal coercively with failed reciprocations.It is the basic point of this essay that the present American collection mechanisms and institutions are grossly inefficient, engendering huge amounts of unnecessary grief and loss for all participants.Only after the anatomy of this malfunction is understood can one expect changes to be made in present collection practices which will eliminate some of this waste.My plan, therefore, is very generally to describe the operation of the American collection system, indicating first how it would operate if collection transactions were cost-free.I will then consider the effects on such a system of collection costs, with special emphasis on how such transaction costs and the effects of those costs vary depending upon who is trying to collect what from whom.Thereafter, I will assay the role of information in the system, both as a weapon in a coercive collection process and as a method of avoiding it.And finally, I will consider collection as a separate and gravely flawed \"market\" and suggest at least the general direction of desirable change.p. 10 infra.",

      "abstract": "The living social reality was for Cooley the society of which he was a part, which he approached by objective introspection. Society is an affair of a consciousness that is necessarily social. The self is not a presupposition of consciousness but arises in communication and is dependent on others who are as immediate as the self. In imagination both self and other have their origin. Public consciousness is the organization of the separate individual experiences. The self is not an immediate character of the mind, for we are not first individual and then social; the mind itself arises through communication. This represents an advance on Baldwin, Tarde, and even James. A self that can reach other selves only through the interpretation of states of consciousness can never be primarily a social self. A difficulty arises when the parallelism of \"ordinary psychology\" is accepted by Cooley. His ethical views ignored primitive impulses and insisted on standards already established. He was not interested in the scientific study of society. But does not the self belong to an objective phase in the tendency to take the role of another? Cooley did not find selves and society arising in primitive processes of communication so that he could grasp their reality in early human behavior. His sociology was in a sense an account of the American community to which he belonged. The gospel of Jesus and democracy were of the essence of it. But if we carry back the social behavior to a point which antedates the psychical as distinct from an outer world, it is to this primitive behavior that one can trace the social patterns that produce society as well as to criticism and reconstruction. To this type of analysis Cooley's assumption closes the door. But Cooley's establishment of the self and others on the same plane of reality and his impressive study of the primary group are positive accomplishments for which we are profoundly indebted.",

The self is not a phenomenon and is thus not accessible to the same kinds of scientific inquiry and measurement as are natural psychological constructs that are observable (e.g., human motor behavior). Self-esteem is nonsensical-cannot be measured through sensory data collection-and hence imaginary (Berlow, personal communication); as a result, an individual's self-esteem must be inferred, either by an individual's report of his/her sense of self (experienced self) or by reporting the individual's self-esteem (presented self). But the social science community has too readily accepted an individual's personal self-report of self-esteem as natural fact. The guiding, and unquestioned assumption has been that the individual alone has access to the self. Who are we as outsiders to question this source of data? Few self-esteem researchers have used others to infer self-esteem-and thus they have relatively little knowledge of the validity of their self-report data (Wells & Marwell, 1976).",

      "title": "Social being and cultural practices",
      "abstract": "Human societies are held together by relationships, conventions, traditions, institutions, and tacit understandings. These things are intangible, and while humans themselves are reproduced as corporeal beings, their societies are sustained by practical activities that continually recreate knowledge, customs, and interpersonal bonds. Just as a language would ultimately disappear if it ceased to be used as a means of communication, so the rules and routines of social life are maintained only if they are practised. The corollary of this is that societies are not fixed and bounded entities as much as arrangements that are continually coming into existence, works (if you like) that are never completed. But material things are also in flux, constantly ripening, maturing, being made, being used consecutively in different ways through their ‘lifespans’, eroding and decaying: so that the social and substantial worlds are as one in being in an unending state of becoming. Nonetheless, objects often have the capacity to endure longer than habits, rules, or affiliations. They continue to exist independently of human beings and their actions. As a result, old artefacts and places occupied in the past can serve to give structure to current practices and transactions, providing cues and prompts, or reminding us of past events and appropriate modes of conduct. Hunter-gatherers have generally lived a way of life that involves making continual reference to natural features and landmarks. Certain distinctive cliffs, hills, islands, trees, and lakes have represented places to return to, or at which to arrange meetings or encounter game. As such they will have been places of periodic resort, and were incorporated into collective history and mythology. Meanwhile, other places acquired a meaning simply because specific people camped there, or met there, or died there. During the Mesolithic in Britain, some locations seem to have been persistently returned to over very long periods of time. One example is the site at North Park Farm, Bletchingley in Surrey, which appears to have been visited sporadically over hundreds of years, although the structural evidence for this at the site was sparse, being limited to a group of fireplaces.",

When we describe a dog or a cat as our best friend, we can only mean that, such people say, in some derivative, lesser sense of ‘friend’. It is not really important, however, precisely how we categorize our relationships with our animal companions. Rather, we need to see just how complex such relationships are and to recognize their unique value. While some standard objections to a straightforward claim that we can be friends with our dogs and cats contain a grain of truth, they are also misleading and require more nuance. There are aspects of our relationships with our companion animals that are just like features of the best sorts of friendships. Because friendship itself is a cluster concept, our relationships to animals actually reveal the range of that concept. However, what matters most is seeing how valuable aspects of our relationships to human friends are replicated, but in novel ways, in our relationships to our animal companions. Thus, our animal companions are not lesser than or substitutes for human friends and loved ones, but rather provide us with unique and irreplaceable opportunities for connection and love.",

      "title": "Introduction : Emotional experience in depression",
      "abstract": "First-person accounts of depression almost always emphasize the extent to which depression departs from what is - for most of us - 'everyday experience'. It is often described as akin to inhabiting a different world, a suffocating, alien realm that is isolated from the rest of social reality. On the basis of a very substantial body of testimony, it seems that depression is not simply a matter of certain unpleasant emotions being heightened while other emotions are diminished. The phenomenological changes that the depressed person undergoes are somehow more profound than that. They involve a qualitative shift in the overall structure of experience, encompassing self, agency, the body, temporal experience, interpersonal relations, and the sense of being rooted in a world. Many sufferers add that this shift or some aspect of it is indescribable, ineffable, and that the various metaphors they appeal to are ultimately inadequate to the task. Furthermore, some state that an inability to communicate the experience of depression exacerbates the sense of alienation that is already so central to it. When we turn to diagnostic manuals, matters are no clearer; skeletal descriptions of the various symptoms that are together sufficient for one or another diagnosis do nothing to further illuminate the kinds of phenomenological change that patients struggle to describe. Hence an aim of this special issue is to draw upon work in philosophy and other disciplines in order to cast light upon poorly understood experiences that are associated (but, most likely, not exclusively associated) with depression. 'Depression', construed broadly, is consist.",

      "abstract": "Human emotions are hypothetic constructs based on psychological and physiological data. According to the psychoevolutionnist theories, all emotions derive from a set of discrete basic emotions, common to human and animals, genetically determined. Basic emotions are thus considered as physiological processes based on specific neuronal circuits. On the contrary, for appraisal and social theories, emotions are psychological processes resulting from the cognitive appraisal of the stimulus-event for the well-being and objectives of the subject, and are of social origin. They develop during life, especially in childhood, from interactions between the individual and his environement. According to the appraisal or constructivist theories, no sharp distinction is to be made between emotions and other manifestations of the affective life. Emotions require the global functioning of the brain, even if more specialized regions are involved. They play a fundamental role in the development of the child's psychological and social life. They mediate the subject's response to the stimulus-event, allowing more appropriate reactions than fixed instinctive ones. Nevertheless, the adaptative function of every emotion or their every component can be questioned. Emotional disturbances are major consequences of psychiatric or neurological disorders. The link between the results of neuropsychological studies of emotions based on the recognition of emotional facal expression according to the basic emotion theory, and the emotional disturbances experienced in daily life is highly questionable on account of the high complexity of human affective life.",

      "title": "The function(s) of consciousness: an evolutionary perspective",
      "abstract": "The functions of consciousness, viewed from an evolutionary standpoint, can be categorized as being either general or particular. There are two general functions, meaning those that do not depend on the particulars of how consciousness influences behavior or how and why it first evolved: of (1) expanding the behavioral repertoire of the individual through the gradual accumulation of neurocircuitry innovations incorporating consciousness that would not exist without it, and (2) reducing the time scale over which preprogrammed behaviors can be altered, from evolutionary time, across generations, to real-time. But neither answers Velmans' question, of why consciousness is adaptive in a proximate sense, and hence why it would have evolved, which depends on identifying the particular function it first performed. Memory arguably plays a role here, as a strong case can be made that consciousness first evolved to make motivational control more responsive, though memory, to the past life experiences of the individual. A control mechanism of this kind could, for example, have evolved to consciously inhibit appetitive behaviors, whether consciously instigated or not, that would otherwise expose the individual to harm. There is then the question of whether, for amniote vertebrates, a role in memory formation and access would have led directly to a wider role for consciousness in the way the brain operates, or if some other explanation is required. Velmans' question might then have two answers, the second having more to do with the advantages of global oversight for the control of behavior, as in a global workspace, or for conferring meaning on sensory experience in a way that non-conscious neural processes cannot. Meaning in this context refers specifically to the way valence is embodied in the genomic instructions for assembling the neurocircuitry responsible for phenomenal contents, so it constitutes an embodied form of species memory, and a way of thinking about the adaptive utility of consciousness that is less concerned with real-time mechanistic events than with information storage on an evolutionary time scale.",

What I know about the contents of my own mind I generally know without investigation or appeal to evidence. There are exceptions, but the primacy of unmediated self-knowledge is attested by the fact that we distrust the exceptions until they can be reconciled with the unmediated. My knowledge of the world outside of myself, on the other hand, depends on the functioning of my sense organs, and this causal dependence on the senses makes my beliefs about the world of nature open to a sort of uncertainty that arises only rarely in the case of beliefs about my own states of mind. Many of my simple perceptions of what is going on in the world are not based on further evidence; my perceptual beliefs are simply caused directly by the events and objects around me. But my knowledge of the propositional contents of other minds is never immediate in this sense; I would have no access to what others think and value if I could not note their behaviour.",

      "abstract": "People are fundamentally social beings and enjoy connecting with others. Sometimes, people reach out to others-whether simply to check-in on how others are doing with brief messages or to show that they are thinking of others by sending small gifts to them. Yet, despite the importance and enjoyment of social connection, do people accurately understand how much other people value being reached out to by someone in their social circle? Across a series of preregistered experiments, we document a robust underestimation of how much other people appreciate being reached out to. We find evidence compatible with an account wherein one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is because responders (vs. initiators) are more focused on their feelings of surprise at being reached out to. A focus on feelings of surprise in turn predicts greater appreciation. We further identify process-consistent moderators of the underestimation of reach-out appreciation, finding that it is magnified when the reach-out context is more surprising: when it occurs within a surprising (vs. unsurprising) context for the recipient and when it occurs between more socially distant (vs. socially close) others. Altogether, this research thus identifies when and why we underestimate how much other people appreciate us reaching out to them, implicating a heightened focus on feelings of surprise as one underlying explanation.

      "abstract": "Dumb mechanisms make smart concepts Eliana Colunga (colunga@psych.colorado.edu) Department of Psychology, 345UCB Boulder, CO 80309 USA Linda B. Smith (smith4@indiana.edu) Department of Psychology, 1101 E. 10 th Street Bloomington, IN 47405 USA Abstract generalization task, children are shown an exemplar like those in Figure 1. They are told its name, and then asked what other things have the same name. When shown an exemplar like that in Figure 1a, with cues indicating it is a depiction of an animate thing, children systematically generalize its name only to new instances that match in both shape and texture, but not to things that match in shape only or texture only. When shown an entity without such features, children systematically generalize the name to new instances that match in shape, whether they match in other properties or not, as shown in Figure 1b. Jones & Smith, (1991) and others have suggested that children learn correlations between features and category structure -- between having eyes and being in a category organized by shape and texture, and between being angular (and without animacy features) and being in a category organized by shape. Consistent with theories and evidence on attentional learning, they suggest that in the novel noun generalization task, these features automatically increase attention to relevant properties, enabling children to attend to the right similarities according to the kind of the object at hand. This correlational learning account has been supported by showing that the requisite correlations between features and category organization exist across the first 300 nouns that children learn (Samuelson & Smith, 1999). There is an ongoing debate on the nature of the processes and knowledge involved in learning language. On one side of the debate, people argue that children learn words through deliberative processes that use propositional conceptual knowledge; on the opposing side, people argue that children learn words through automatic processes and knowledge based on learned associations among perceptual features. In this paper we concentrate on the Animate/Inanimate distinction as evidenced in children’s novel noun generalizations. The results of two experiments with 3-year- olds and adults suggest that 1) automatic processing guides children’s generalizations of novel nouns and 2) “conceptual” knowledge may be formed as a web of learned correlations. Background The nature of the processes and knowledge involved in children’s learning of new nouns is a highly contentious issue. Children generalize names for things in appropriate ways depending on the kind of thing being named. For example they generalize names for artifacts by their shape; names for non-solid substances by their material; and names for animates by their shape and texture. The debate centers on the nature of the processes and knowledge involved in this behavior. On one side of the debate, people argue that children reason about category membership using slow, deliberative, conscious processes and propositional beliefs about categories and category structure (Gelman & Markman, 1987; Keil, 1994; Kemler-Nelson, Russell, Duke & Jones, 2000). On the opposite side, people support fast, unconscious, automatic processes and knowledge in the form of correlations among perceptual features (Smith, 1995; Smith, 2000; Smith, Colunga & Yoshida, 2003). Sometimes this debate has been framed in terms of whether children’s early word learning is “smart” (reflective, conceptual) or “dumb” (built from more basic general and automatic processes). In this paper we concentrate on the Animate/Inanimate distinction as shown in children’s novel noun generalizations. We show evidence that automatic processing guides children’s generalizations of novel nouns, and suggest that the “conceptual” knowledge that enters word learning, even in adults, may be me made out of correlations of perceptual features. One widely used task to study children’s word learning biases is the novel noun generalization task. In this Figure 1. Examples of an exemplar with cues indicating it is a depiction of an animate thing, and an exemplar with artifact cues. Recently, Booth and Waxman (2002) provided support for the alternative “smart” interpretation of children’s performance in this task. Booth and Waxman presented exemplars in a context that construed them as animate or inanimate. The disambiguating context consisted of brief stories in which the experimenter gave the child information about the exemplar. For example, in the animate condition,",

      "abstract": "We argue that imitation is a learning response to unintelligible actions, especially to social conventions. Various strands of evidence are converging on this conclusion, but further progress has been hampered by an outdated theory of perceptual experience. Comparative psychology continues to be premised on the doctrine that humans and nonhuman primates only perceive others’ physical ‘surface behavior’, while mental states are perceptually inaccessible. However, a growing consensus in social cognition research accepts the Direct Perception Hypothesis: primarily we see what others aim to do; we do not infer it from their motions. Indeed, physical details are overlooked – unless the action is unintelligible. On this basis we hypothesize that apes’ propensity to copy the goal of an action, rather than its precise means, is largely dependent on its perceived intelligibility. Conversely, children copy means more often than adults and apes because, uniquely, much adult human behavior is completely unintelligible to unenculturated observers due to the pervasiveness of arbitrary social conventions, as exemplified by customs, rituals, and languages. We expect the propensity to imitate to be inversely correlated with the familiarity of cultural practices, as indexed by age and/or socio-cultural competence. The Direct Perception Hypothesis thereby helps to parsimoniously explain the most important findings of imitation research, including children’s over-imitation and other species-typical and age-related variations.",

      "abstract": "Robot-Human Interaction -- How Robot Approach Behaviors Affect Human Perception of a Robot’s Character and Role Masashi Komori (komori@isc.osakac.ac.jp) Faculty of Information and Communication Engineering, Osaka Electro-Communication University, 18-8 Hatsucho, Neyagawa, Osaka 572-8530, Japan Chika Nagaoka (nagaoka@educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp) Graduate School of Education, Kyoto University, Yoshida Honmachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan Keywords: robot; immediacy; character Introduction When building computational artifacts that are capable of social relationships with human, it is desirable for these artifacts to possess a human form like those of humanoids, bipedal robots and anthropomorphic agents. If these artifacts appear human-like, they can display nonverbal social interaction cues. In particular, physically embodied artifacts such as bipedal robots can use the nonverbal, spatial channels that are studied in the field of proxemics. In the case of human-human communication, behavior that decreases spatial distance is a crucial factor in increasing immediacy, which is strongly related to affection, attachment, and intimacy (e.g. Mehrabian, 1969). Therefore, a robot's spatial approach towards a user may improve the user’s impression of the robot, and may change their expectation of the robot. This study explores how the way a robot approaches a person influences that person’s perception of the robot’s character and their expectations of the robot’s role such as a work partner, an assistant, a pet or a toy. Figure 1: Translocation task. randomly chose from among the actions. The colors (red, blue and yellow) and the stimuli were counterbalanced. Participants performed a translocation task for 10 min that required them to move toward the instructed markers on the floor every 15 sec. The marker order was random. Before the task, each participant was given a false explanation that the purpose of the experiment was to investigate human walking behavior among the robots and that each robot worked according to a different algorithm. Both before and after the task, participants rated on bipolar 5-point scales their affective responses towards the robots (likeability, fear), their evaluations of the robots' character (intimacy, intelligence, social extroversion, ascendancy and agreeableness), and their role expectation (partner, assistant, pet and toy). Experimental Method Thirty-six undergraduate students from the Osaka Electro- Communication Univ. (31 males and 5 females) between the ages of 20-24 years participated in the experiment. The experiment was conducted in a 6 m by 8 m room (Figure 1). For the purpose of the experiment, the zone where participants could move was indicated on the floor with vinyl tape using nine markers in three different shapes ( □ ,U, and ×) and three colors (either blue, red, or yellow). The participants’ behavior was monitored at remote place where the robot operators were stationed using a video camera. Three bipedal robots (Kondo Kagaku: KHR-1) were used as stimuli. Each robot was painted in blue, red, or yellow, and had a small dummy video camera and LCD on its head. The robots were controlled in one of three ways: (1) manual operation, where the operator repeatedly chose among the actions go straight, turn right, or turn left, making the robot pursue the participant; (2) half-automatic operation, where half the time the robot was manually operated and half the time a computer randomly chose from among the programmed actions go straight, turn right, or turn left; and (3) automatic operation; the computer repeatedly and Results and Discussion In order to examine the effect of robot approach patterns in terms of the difference between pre- and post-evaluations, we conducted a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. There were significant interactions between the approach patterns and the pre/post evaluations in terms of intimacy, intelligence, social extraversion, ascendance and expectation as a partner and as an assistant (p<.05), but not among the others. The results indicate that an increase in immediacy caused by the robots’ approach behaviors affected the participants’ evaluations of the robots’ characteristics, and also increased the users’ expectations that the robots could function as partners or assistants.

Everyone learns, consciously or not, accurately or not, various ways of controlling others for one's own ends. Few people spend much time calculating how to control others, but everyone does so part of the time. Whatever people do, for whatever goals, will be evaluated by others, who will become thereby more or less willing to cooperate, more or less likely to resist, more or less likely to continue in the relationship. We all interact with others, engage in a flow of transactions with others; and whatever we do has some effect on others, to our advantage or not, in conformity with our wishes or not, and whether or not we will it so. Consequently, however else we might classify the wide range of human acts, we can also view them as samples of social control processes, i.e., the ways by which people shape the flow of each other's behavior. Almost all can be grouped into a small number of tvyes of social control forces. One of these is force and forcethreat, which I shall henceforth simply call force; when I mean only I shall so label it.' The use of force-and I repeat, I mean by this term both force-threat and overt force-is as ubiquitous as the preachments against it. Whatever else social systems are, they are also force systems. Force constitutes one of the major foundations of all social structures. The processes by which the command of force is expended, exchanged, accumulated, or lost, are universal in social interaction, because force is one of the fundamental resources people and groups need to elicit cooperation, help, and conformity from one another. Force constitutes one of the four great social control systems in all societies. For two millennia, social analysts have given much attention to three of these-which they have variously termed force, prestige, and wealth-because these underlie all stratification systems.2 The fourth, which",

Since artificial agents are increasingly populating our daily environments, the question arises whether (and under which conditions) humans would apply the \"human model\" to understand the behaviors of these new social agents. Thus, in a series of three experiments, we tested whether embedding humans in a social interaction with a humanoid robot either displaying a human-like or machine-like behavior would modulate their initial tendency to adopt the intentional stance. Results showed that indeed humans are more prone to adopt the intentional stance after having interacted with a more socially available and human-like robot, while no modulation of the adoption of the intentional stance emerged toward a mechanistic robot. We conclude that short experiences with humanoid robots presumably inducing a \"like-me\" impression and social bonding increase the likelihood of adopting the intentional stance.",

A different strategy of testing whether or not animals are capable of episodic memory is to adopt an ethological perspective and consider cases in nature in which an animal might need simultaneously to retrieve and integrate information about what happened, where and when during a specific previous experience. The ability to remember the ‘what, where, and when’ of individual past episodes is probably met by several behaviours. When considering the evolutionary history of episodic-like memory in animals, it might seem intuitively logical to focus on the abilities of non-human primates. The study of non-human primate coalition or alliance formation might provide a useful starting point, given that the social partners need to keep track of cognitively complex social relationships.",

People in a society might agree on what is moral behaviour in some circumstances, and disagree in others. Different societies have different agreements, different moralities with different ethical ways of living; and different groups in a particular society might have different moralities with different ethical ways of living. We, from our own social perspective, might not find other moralities acceptable – be those the moralities of other societies or of other groups within our society – and there are basic questions of how we accommodate moralities not our own, or which is the “correct” morality. There are those who think they know what is right and what is wrong, and others who take a more nuanced approach, though they might prefer a certain morality/ideology. On the one hand, Adam Smith, for example, knew there was a true morality which came from God (or the Deity) and thus cultural relativism was based on an incorrect premise – “Part III, Chapter V: Of the influence and authority of the general Rules of Morality, and that they are justly regarded as the Laws of the Deity” [Smith(1759, 1790)]. In a famous/infamous article, Francis Fukuyama when discussing the natures of different types of society (fascist, communist, democratic) made the ideological difference almost one of morality, and he foresaw the ultimate dominance of the morality/ideology of “economic and political liberalism”. He argued that, when talking about changes in communist societies, commentators “sense dimly that there is some larger process at work, a process that gives coherence and order to the daily headlines.” (“The End of History?”, The National Interest, Summer 1989).

The result of destruction is usually the destruction of something (partial or complete).

      "title": "Explosive Contagion in Networks",
      "abstract": "Abstract The spread of social phenomena such as behaviors, ideas or products is an ubiquitous but remarkably complex phenomenon. A successful avenue to study the spread of social phenomena relies on epidemic models by establishing analogies between the transmission of social phenomena and infectious diseases. Such models typically assume simple social interactions restricted to pairs of individuals; effects of the context are often neglected. Here we show that local synergistic effects associated with acquaintances of pairs of individuals can have striking consequences on the spread of social phenomena at large scales. The most interesting predictions are found for a scenario in which the contagion ability of a spreader decreases with the number of ignorant individuals surrounding the target ignorant. This mechanism mimics ubiquitous situations in which the willingness of individuals to adopt a new product depends not only on the intrinsic value of the product but also on whether his acquaintances will adopt this product or not. In these situations, we show that the typically smooth (second order) transitions towards large social contagion become explosive (first order). The proposed synergistic mechanisms therefore explain why ideas, rumours or products can suddenly and sometimes unexpectedly catch on.",

      "abstract": "It is generally assumed that verbal communication can articulate concepts like 'fact' and 'truth' accurately. However, language is fundamentally inaccurate and ambiguous and it is not possible to express exact propositions accurately in an ambiguous medium. Whether truth exists or not, language cannot express it in any exact way. A major problem for verbal communication is that words are fundamentally differently interpreted by the sender and the receiver. In addition, intrapersonal verbal communication - the voice in our head - is a useless extension to the thought process and results in misunderstanding our own thoughts. The evolvement of language has had a profound impact on human life. Most consequential has been that it allowed people to question the old human rules of behavior - the pre-language way of living. As language could not accurately express the old rules, they lost their authority and disappeared. A long period without any rules of how to live together must have followed, probably accompanied by complete chaos. Later, new rules were devised in language, but the new rules were also questioned and had to be enforced by punishment. Language changed the peaceful human way of living under the old rules into violent and aggressive forms of living under punitive control. Religion then tried to incorporate the old rules into the harsh verbal world. The rules were expressed in language through parables: imaginary beings - the gods - who possessed the power of the old rules, but who could be related to through their human appearance and behavior.",

      "abstract": "In order to evaluate the impact of physical activity, especially continuous activity such as walking, cycling or running, on the lower limb joints, we overviewed approximately one hundred sources observing the subject from various directions and from different research points of view. The sources were divided into five categories: those claiming damage, those that are inconclusive, those claiming no damage, reviews, and animal experiments. Reviewing this comprehensive material revealed the evidence that high impact sports activity will damage a normal joint which has not suffered a previous injury or anatomic variation and which does not carry a genetic fault, to be borderline, though existent. In many of the cases which do suffer damage, a concealed injury has previously occurred, single or recurrent, and the injured joint would tend to present with secondary arthritic changes. The evidence that continuous non-high impact physical activity like walking, cycling or running would damage a joint with no prior anatomical damage and which does not suffer a biomechanical or genetic fault, is weak and non-persuasive, while the literature supporting no damaging effect or even improvement of the joint construction is far more persuasive and abundant. This evidence is stronger in animal experiments than in research performed with human subjects. The safest activity, it seems, is gradual and graded activity with no exploding force, not extreme and which is not irregular for the individual trainee. The advantages of the physical activity to the general health as well as to the musculo-skeletal system seem to strongly overcome their potential risks.",

      "abstract": "The self is herein recognized as self-consciousness, a broad dynamic system of self-recognition and self-reference. Eight psychosomatic and extended cognitive functions working as an interactive whole are proposed to constitute self-consciousness: (1) somatic domain and body image; (2) situation and domestic range; (3) agency and power to act; (4) introspection, mindfulness, and metacognition; (5) first person discourse and appropriation; (6) episodic memory, autobiography, and role; (7) attribution and alterity; (8) conscience, moral consciousness, and ethical stance. These functions, complemented with considerations about depersonalization and selflessness, are briefly defined and described. These subsystems may work independently but they may interact and variably coalesce according to the demands of the task. Since self-awareness would require a dynamic swarm-like activation pattern of the cluster, the self does not reside in particular brain sites or networks but depends on top-down and bottom-up mechanisms coupled with incoming and outgoing sensory-motor data loops. This psychophysical theory avoids the swing between internal and external elements in favor of an embracing I-World patterned process that comprises neural, bodily, behavioral, environmental, and social dimensions converging in the construction and expression of self-conscious and personal identity experiences integrated by a participant brain.",

On the basis of this observation, what is proposed here is a conception of anorexia as bodily intersubjective: Anorexia would involve, via the manipulation of food and eating behavior, the transformation of the subject’s body, as a way of impacting her relations to others. The anorexic subject would instrumentalize her eating behavior and bodily shape to address others, thereby putting them in a position to respond to her meaningfully, by manifesting their sensitivity to her desire. Importantly, in this view, anorexia is not positioned on the intersubjective scene by opposition to the bodily and alimentary scene; rather, what is proposed is that anorexic sufferance is intersubjective insofar as it is bodily. After some clinical observations describing how anorexia is bodily intersubjective in a concrete way, an overview allows for consideration of whether this conception of anorexia conflicts with or is supported by the main approaches that are currently influential in this field.",

An adult in a wholly strange environment also may still be at home within himself; indeed, he may depend more on himself, the less a strange environment welcomes him. Alienation from oneself is something quite different, and estrangement is different again (which is what we will have to show in a roundabout way). It is easy to hear where some sounds come from.

      "title": "On Huizinga's Theory of Play",
      "abstract": "The play that Huizinga had discussed was mainly that of social one namely, game. He argued that we should take hold of play by the way of characteristics—describing. The characteristics of play that he had described were mainly as follows: (1) Voluntary or free. Play is a kind of life-activity that is free in the meaning of ″voluntary″. (2) Dummy or of pretending to believe, of internal purpose and of non-material benefits. Play is a kind of dummy activity that organisms pretend to believe it as true and treat it seriously. In the playtime, organisms take the activity itself as the internal purpose, and do not seek for external material benefits. Therefore, play is a kind of activity that is of non-material benefits. (3) Obstructed. People play in particular time and space and with the abidance of particular rules that differ from that of realistic activities, which make play have a kind of insulation opposite to realistic activities. (4) The absoluteness or authority of the rules of games and the beauty-appreciatability of the forms of games. The rules are the necessary conditions for collective activities. For the games' going in gear, the rules of games must be valid generally or absolutely to all participants. Games in ideal conditions have the high orders, and therefore have the beauty-appreciatability of the forms of games. Tally up the above-mentioned characteristics of play, we can express Huizinga's basic viewpoint of play as follows: Play is a kind of dummy activity in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose and therefore do not seek for external benefits. In the characteristics that Huizinga had described, the purpose's internality of the activity is most fundamental. Seizing this fundamental characteristic, we can briefly recapitulate Huizinga's viewpoint of play as follows: Play is a kind of life-activity in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose. This is just Huizinga's viewpoint of play on the theory of internal purpose. There were actually several concepts of play at different levels from wide sense to narrow sense in Huizinga's mind: play in the wide sense refers to all dummy activities in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose (including individual play and collective play); play in the middle sense refers to collective play—social game played by people in particular time and space (for leisure) and according to particular rules; and play in the narrow sense refers to competitive game—collective play with the characteristic of competition in which people aim at the satisfaction of the demand of pursuing superiority and other related mental demands. In discussing the relationship between mankind's culture and play, what Huizinga called (″play″) only refers to competitive game actually. Huizinga's play theory is mainly that about collective play, especially, about competitive game. The applicability of his play theory was waiting to be documented further. His theory of internal purpose about play—taking (the activity) itself as the purpose—contains the logic error of confusing means with purpose, therefore, his linguistic expression for the theory is not accurate.",

      "title": "Multidimensional Educational Models Recommended by Innovative Agonology – Examples of Physical Education and Music Education",
      "abstract": "Almost all types of education are in some sense multidimensional, even if it is difficult to ascribe formal, or passion-driven, experiential, cognitive-behavioral competences closely related to the subject of education to the teaching subject (an individual or a team). From the perspective of the mission of innovative agonology, the most valuable ways, methods, forms and means of educational activities are those whose use (in a session, in a cycle, or as a ‘passion for life’) stimulates as much as possible some aspect of somatic, mental and social health, but also at least one element (component) of survival.From a broader point of view, i.e. the social mission of evidence-based science, the important premise is that although humans are genetically adapted to operate in terrestrial environments, however, they are also active underground, in water, in the air and in space. In each of these environments, one pole of the continuum of survival possibilities accumulates minimal health criteria, while the opposite pole – a long list of factors that mean inevitable death. This diversity of human operating environments and the roles they fulfill within them implies the legitimacy of recommending very complex educational models, some of which require multilevel selection.Apart from individual career paths, swimming and wrestling (even if pursued without the pressure of sports performance) optimally stimulate the somatic dimension of health (hard-respiratory capacity, strength and endurance of the largest muscle groups and flexibility) compared to other sporting activities. The survival dimension is already diverse. For instance, swimming skills increase the chance of survival in an aquatic environment while hand-to-hand combat skills increase the likelihood of effective self-defense in situations of physical aggression. And wrestling is a contact sport (psychophysical activity involving a permanent ‘dialogue of minds and bodies’), so it qualifies as a model that also stimulates the mental dimension of health. Moreover, in general, also the adepts of other martial arts interact in a peculiar way with the centuries-old heritage of the cultures from which these arts originate (social dimension of health). Unfortunately, the effective and attractive status of educational models based on martial arts is depreciated by the pathology of bloody fights of neo-gladiatorship. These spectacles are promoted and camouflaged in the public sphere precisely under the banner of mixed martial arts (the first part of the phrase ‘mixed’ is only 31.25% of the name).Brazilian capoeira is an example of a multifaceted educational model that combines martial art with music. Although innovative agonology is an appropriate science for formulating justifications at the interface between these two arts (martial art and music), the well-established standards of music education are its competition. These standards include respect for centuries-old traditions and multiculturalism, a commitment to routine with an awareness of the unlimited potential for creating beauty and positive emotions. The coordinating perfectionism of the instrumentalists is also admired. However, a hypothesis is justified: ignoring scientific knowledge (including human motor skills) from areas of activity other than music is the cause of, among other things, interpersonal conflicts (for instance teacher-student) and negative effects encompassing all dimensions of health.",

In all cases detection of the danger was easy or indications by some warning were distinct. In a typical case, a lineman, after cleaning the insulators of a suspended line, proceeded toward the danger zone of another line charged with current on reaching the ground. He disregarded the warning flag, and received a shock and fell to the ground. It was also common in all the other cases that victims were conducting relatively easy or habitual activities and responded, being almost unaware of the unusual physical characteristics of the environment, to its more apparent aspects. These errors were relevant to experimental results by the author that subjects had great difficulty in identifying the rule of presentation of signal figures if the key item and the rule, either serial or positional, were different from foregoing trials. It is suggested that an individual fails to see an external object that has little function value in regard to the content of the current behavior under influence of personal habitual experiences and the theories of human error need to be reconstruct as the basis of ecological knowledge about them.",

      "abstract": "‘Eliminativism’ refers to the view that mental phenomena – for example, beliefs, desires, conscious states – do not exist. Although this can seem absurd on its face, in the twentieth century it has gained a wide variety of adherents, for example, scientific behaviourists, who thought that all human and animal activity could be explained in terms of the history of patterns of stimuli, responses and reinforcements; as well as some who have thought that neurophysiology alone is all that is needed. Two immediate objections to eliminativism – for example, that it is incoherent because it claims there are no ‘claims’, and that it conflicts with data of which we are all immediately aware – arguably beg the question against the view. What is wanted is non-tendentious evidence for the mind. Contrary to behaviourism, this seems to be available in the intelligent behaviour of most higher animals.",

      "abstract": "“God has No Allergies”: Immanent Ethics and the Simulacra of the Immune System Adrian Mackenzie “[T]he science of life always accommodates a philosophy of life.”1 Conventional approaches to bioethics long for a purified set of principles in order to guide the application of scientific knowledges of the body — the life sciences — to individual “cases.” In the realm of bioethics, the possibility that these knowledges might themselves constitute entities such as the individual, or the possibility that the individual body might itself be something other than the more or less governable a-historical object of technoscientific action, awakens a kind of horror autotoxicus. Nor do the prevalent modes of ethical discourse react kindly to the possibility that the “living” body of an individual is also a self, an actor within a complicated set of narratives, codes and apparatuses whose various registers — medical, economic, racial, sexual, religious, and so on — intersect. In short, conventional bioethical discourses refuse to acknowledge that, as Emmanual Levinas has written, “the body is a permanent contestation of the prerogative attributed to consciousness of ‘giving meaning’ to each thing; it lives as this contestation.”2 Traditional bioethics disappoints us insofar as it overlooks the ways the body contests the prerogatives of consciousness, contests reason and self-identity. Instead of opening onto the possibility of divergent ethea, bioethics’ universalizing adjudicative principles legitimate the biomedical normalization of differences by trying to deal only with the moral rights of the rational self and by leaving the differing character of embodiment — a most profound aspect of the ethical habitat — aside. In its separation of scientific theory and “ethical” practice, and in its unwillingness to transit any borders into the epistemological territory of science, conventional bioethics misapprehends the active and ambivalent role of technoscientific intervention, an intervention which both produces these crucial differences in embodiment and participates in their effacement. Traditional bioethics allergically responds to the ethical issue — the maintenance of ethos, of embodied differences, of the character and habits of individual bodies. Bios: nomó “Now it is over life, throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its dominion.”3 Foucault’s well-known description of a shift during the last two centuries from sovereign to disciplinary power or “bio-power” implies a displacement in the substance of ethics.4 In diverse discourses and domains, it becomes increasingly obvious that the presumed exclusion of ethics from the theoretical-pragmatic complex of science itself, from the very concrete operations and forces of technoscientific discourses engaging living bodies, significantly limits the relevance and effectiveness of the traditional notion of ethics.5 As Donna Haraway describes it, “the power of biomedical language . . . for shaping the unequal experience of sickness and death for millions is a social fact deriving from on-going heterogeneous social processes.” 6 The morality-displacing power of biomedical discourse and practice does not confine itself to sickness and death, but branches out into the normalization of whole populations. At many different scales and under different aspects — birth, death, sexual relations, work, fitness, stress, leisure, and so on — life is targeted by the vectors of biomedical intervention. Again, Foucault makes this point succinctly when he writes of the emergence of bio-power: “For the first time in history, no doubt, biological existence was reflected in political existence; the fact of living was no longer an inaccessible substrate that only emerged from time to time; amid the randomness of death and its fatality; part of it passed into knowledge’s field of control and power’s sphere of intervention.”7 The propagation of bio-power — designating “what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculation and made knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life”8 — powerfully challenges any responsive ethics to address the realm of physiology and to reframe the ethical substance to include the embodiment of biomedical materiality. In other words, so-called “physiological” or “biological” questions increasingly raise ethical issues in ways that cannot be disentangled from the historical conditions of life as a locus of power relations or, conversely, solved through an a-historical ethico-moral calculus. Under the auspices of bio-power, biological knowledge increasingly presents itself as the ground of self-realization and governance...",

      "abstract": "Although much previous work describes evolutionary mechanisms that promote or stabilize different social behaviors, we still have little understanding of the factors that drive animal behavior proximately. Here we present a modeling approach to answer this question. Our model rests on motivations to achieve objectives as the proximate determinants of behavior. We develop a two-tiered framework by first modeling the dynamics of a social interaction at the behavioral time scale and then find the evolutionarily stable objectives that result from the outcomes these dynamics produce. We use this framework to ask whether “other-regarding” motivations, which result from a kind of nonselfish objective, can evolve when individuals are engaged in a social interaction that entails a conflict between their material payoffs. We find that, at the evolutionarily stable state, individuals can be other-regarding in that they are motivated to increase their partners' payoff as well as their own. In contrast to previous theories, we find that such motivations can evolve because of their direct effect on fitness and do not require kin selection or a special group structure. We also derive general conditions for the evolutionary stability of other-regarding motivations. Our conditions indicate that other-regarding motivations are more likely to evolve when social interactions and behavioral objectives are both synergistic.",

The basic concept needs to be understood that humans are spiritual and physical beings, so what is inside us cannot be fully understood by others, if we do not want to reveal to them. Other people cannot understand our ideas, feelings, intentions and intentions if we do not consciously convey to them. Interpersonal communication is communication that occurs in two directions reciprocally between two or more people. Interpersonal communication is very appropriate to do, because between communicators and communicants can discuss each other about various problems. Communicators can see directly the communicant response during the communication process. Interpersonal communication is practiced by many communicators as a process of approach to communicants, such as completing a problem, da'wah, trial process and others. As one effective method of communication, interpersonal communication still exists even though there are many methods of communication that are currently developing, such as virtual communication that communicators and communicants do not have to meet to communicate. Basically, interpersonal communication indirectly creates mutual respect between communicators and communicants. So that this method is very effective for the process of problem solving between communicants and communicators.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Past research demonstrates that reminders of one’s own mortality can lead to materialistic and self-serving consumer behaviors. In contrast, across five studies, we explore a condition under which mortality salience (MS) leads to increased tendency to give away one’s possessions—when the donation act is high in transcendence potential. We propose and find that consumers are more likely to donate their possessions to charity under MS (vs. comparison conditions) when the product is considered highly (vs. not highly) connected to the self. Moreover, we demonstrate that this tendency manifests only when transcendence is attainable through donation. In support of the proposition of transcendence as the underlying mechanism, the observed effects are attenuated under conditions where: (1) transcendence has already been satiated via alternative means or (2) the donated possession will not transcend the self (i.e., its physical integrity is lost by being broken down and recycled). The theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The real protagonist, the true subject and object of the late 20th-century technological revolution in the field of communication, is the human body. It has become a fluctuating and hybrid entity, and has lost whatever it had of the unknowable and incommunicable. It is no longer a monad in search of a place, word, or gesture, but a terminal that is never switched off. The human body is endowed with communication, not by subjective choice, but as the result of an objective condition: its status in a world where the forms of social reproduction themselves (production, exchange, consumption) have been completely absorbed into communications systems. The concept of communication no longer refers merely to the transference of information from sender to recipient. Theories of communication based on the notion of \"sign\" have shown that communication always involves a process of interpretation; messages are reciprocal. Signs, and even signals, produced, exchanged, and consumed, imply shifts in social identity, more extensive levels of connotation, myth making, and meta-communicational awareness.",

There is some mention of similar classification in the work of Iamblichos, but a more extensive study of these similarities in ancient Greece and present-day mediumnistic activities will be the center of another paper to be published later.The research is based on personal and verbal inquiries and on a quite extensive written questionnaire (117 questions) which was sent to spiritual professional mediums and some of the results are here mentioned, especially concerning deceased persons: the way the mediums perceive space around the entities, movements and surroundings, belongings, emotional states and the kind of messages received (nearly always the same wish to be recognized as still living). In general, mediums feel themselves relaxed when they undergo their seances, but they feel that they are in another state of consciousness, without always being able to define precisely what changed in their body or in their mind. Guides are giving another kind of message, more personal (advice for future actions) and with moral implications. High Entities can't be asked to come; when they appear very often some fear and an immense loving atmosphere are experienced simultaneously.",

Only after infancy such knowledge is rationally analyzed, interpreted, and communicated by means of the language. At any rate, because of the above-discussed physical differences that characterize us, not all the knowledge we acquire along our life may be communicated in exactly the way in which it has been acquired. This is just to repeat that the communication can never have the character of objectivity in its strict sense. In other words, the social consensus may never eliminate all possible elements of subjectivity both in the communicants and in the recipients. Therefore, the necessity to bring the communication to the personal dimension of every one of us for its pacific use in the context of the common sense, may result in an unconscious concealment or modification (surely different from person to person) of crucial aspects of the communication itself.

      "title": "Loneliness: The Silent Killer",
      "abstract": "Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to everyone. It has no single and widespread cause. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of loneliness as a potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically from person to person. Notwithstanding the deleterious impact on quality of life and life satisfaction, loneliness has an equivalent risk factor to health as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day, thereby shortening one's life span by eight years. Humans can survive three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food—as told by survival lore—and three months without companionship. We are a social and gregarious people. People simply need people. Loneliness is a complicated emotion. Some people can feel lonely in a crowded room or feel content in solitude. A quick way to think about loneliness is this: It's the difference between how much social connection or interaction people want and how much they are getting. It is essential to acknowledge that these relationships should be important and positive. A few positive relationships are far better than a dozen negative interactions. Thus, it is a subjective feeling. Without that social connection, people often become depressed, which further feeds feelings of loneliness. Loneliness has been linked to higher rates of heart disease, alcohol and drug addition, violence, anxiety, depression, altered brain function, Alzheimer's disease progression, decreased memory and learning, increased stress levels, suicide, and even death. Loneliness is almost as prevalent as obesity and has shown to impact all aspects of quality of life. Loneliness causes people to feel empty, alone, and unwanted. Loneliness is clearly a public health concern. Over the past two decades, there has been a threefold increase in the number of Americans who say they have no close confidants. More than fifty-five million people in the US described themselves as lonely or socially isolated. One of our responses to COVID-19 is social distancing, where we stay six feet away from others. This is a misnomer. Don't we really mean physically distancing because we engage in phone conversations, email each other, attend Zoom meetings, and so on? Perhaps it is time for US institutions of higher education to follow one approach to combating loneliness used in the United Kingdom: appointing a minister of loneliness at the dean's level or above. Loneliness is a universal condition that affects all of us directly or through the people we know and love. A sad reality of modern life is that loneliness is pervasive and on the rise. In fact, since 1985, the number of people in the US who indicated they had no close friends has tripled. Loneliness has been found to be a serious impediment to flourishing while cultivating strong positive connections with people has been seen to bring meaning and well-being to individuals. Loneliness is also a strong predictor of poor health. To feel lonely is to experience a sense of being painfully disconnected, left out, and isolated, with no one to turn to for emotional and social support. Since the dawn of antiquity, we have been built to be social creatures. Across key demographics, younger generations are lonelier than older generations, men are lonelier than women, higher-income people are less lonely than those with lower incomes, and those living in urban and suburban communities are less lonely than those in rural areas. Department chairs are in an enviable position to address loneliness in their faculty and staff. Although COVID-19 has reduced in-person interactions, chairs can still be cognizant of how department members are relating to other faculty, staff, and students. Colleges are often equipped with resources and services such as group sessions, counseling, and workshops to proactively address many types of issues. One of the best ways that chairs can help with loneliness is to recognize that it is a very real possibility and to stay connected with faculty and staff via regular interactions with them. Perhaps Thomas Wolfe said it best in God's Lonely Man: “The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.” Robert E.

      "abstract": "in society; for example, the problem of the relation of variation in elements of identification to variation in occupational role behavior, and that of the way in which the identifications of individuals function within the organizations in which they work. Let us consider, as an instance of the latter class of problem, the way in which variations in these elements of identification affect the relative ease of an individual's mobility through occupational institutions, keeping in mind the effect which differences in mobility potential have on the organizations in which these people work. If, in identifying himself occupationally, an individual exhibits an intense identification with a particular institutional position or a particular set of tasks or with both of these, movement to some other position, or movement which involves a shift in the actual job done, becomes more difficult. The physiologists exemplify this tendency. Tied to their particular research problems and techniques, they are unable to envision themselves occupying any but the few positions they know of in which they can pursue these problems in the way they know best. Even the minor move to department chairman worries them. Neither the engineers nor philosophers have any such commitment to task or institutional position, and movement is much more possible for them, should it become an alternative available to them. The engineers, for example, are ready to move into any kind of position in the country's industrial system, while the philosophers are able to consider with equanimity many kinds of positions involving a variety of skills, as long as they allow for continued intellectual activity. The physiologists' limited view allows them to fit easily into the limited mobility pattern of the university when they actually take their positions in it, just as the engineers' high mobility potential allows them to meet with ease the personnel needs of the expanding industrial economy into which they are moving. In this sense, identifications have functional consequences for institutions.",

      "abstract": "Behaviour sequences commonly consist of highly variable appetitive phases leading to rather fixed consummatory acts. Action-pattern rigidity is typical of the terminal moments of a reaction chain. This basic fact is all too often obscured by the artificial conditions of behaviour studies. Observations on laboratory or captive animals tend to conceal the degree of variability of the earlier phases of each sequence. The simplicity and sterility of the unnatural environment offered to the animal causes differential damage to its motoric performance, attacking the early stages more and the later stages less. A caged animal will feed, drink, nest and copulate, but it cannot set off on lengthy quests for food, water, nest material or a mate. Notorious laboratory devices such as the Skinner-box have served to eliminate totally any possibility for motoric variability. The emphasis in laboratory studies of this kind has been steadfastly concentrated on the variability in the relationship between simple stimuli and an artificially rigidified response. Although the study of this (SR) relationship is an important aspect of animal psychology, it is extremely misleading to overstress its importance as has been done so often in the past. To equate it with the whole topic of animal behaviour is like claiming that the gaming rooms of Las Vegas reflect the whole of human endeavour.",

      "title": "The Presence of Absence: The Concept of Lack in Sociality",
      "abstract": "The Presence of Absence: The Concept of Lack in Sociality Benjamin Lozano Arjun Appadurai, Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger, Duke University Press, Durham NC, 2006 Thomas M. Hawley, The Remains of War: Bodies, Politics, and the Search for American Soldiers Unaccounted For in Southeast Asia, Duke University Press, Durham NC, 2005 The colloquial definition of “lack” - deficiency, wanting, or otherwise unavailability of some key element or feature - often assumes that there is now something absent where it was once (or at least ought to have been) present. “This steak lacks salt”, “For lack of funds the project was left incomplete”, or, “The body’s lack of white blood cells rendered it incapable of fighting off disease”, one might remark, therein implying that if that which is lacking or absent were in fact present in said-noun, the phenomenon under consideration would not be in occurrence. Under these terms, lack equates to an effective negation or withdrawal of some essential feature, whereas the absence of lack, presence, equates to positivity, a fullness or wholeness necessary to said-noun’s essence. And though this common assumption may appear all too obvious in the respective commonalities of cooking, financing construction projects, and epidemiology, two recent books - Arjun Appadurai’s Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger, and Thomas M. Hawley’s The Remains of War: Bodies Politics, and the Search for American Soldiers Unaccounted For in Southeast Asia - argue that in sociality the presence of absence functions to the contrary. For both authors, lack in sociality is not absence where presence belongs. Rather, lack is that which proceeds to instill a fullness or presence of absence where there was once neither presence nor absence; in other words, lack itself functions as a presence of absence in sociality that often emanates or is created ex nihilo, the concrete effects of which prove more decisive than would be thought upon first glance. Fear of Small Numbers is intended by Appadurai as a follow-up to his 1996 Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, a study largely dedicated to investigating the complex structural modifications an increasingly globalized world poses for the interactive “disjunctures” between the nation-state, local communities, and the imagination of social practices. In part, then, one might likewise view this second installment in Appadurai’s general project as a response to the critical reception Modernity at Large received upon its initial publication. “Some critics”, Appadurai notes in his Preface to Fear of Small Numbers, “saw the book as being insufficiently attentive to the darker sides of globalization,” or what psychoanalysts might call globalization’s “other scene.” Americans, for instance, laud cheap food and clothing prices from various outlets, and yet on the production-side of the equation, prefer to remain unaware that these prices are so low precisely due to exorbitant exploitation of the labor and resources of poor, local communities without option as to the terms of sale. Appadurai cites less banal and sociologically more complex examples of globalization’s other scene in his new work, extending beyond the contradictions of the ubiquity of global capital, organizing his theoretic framework around a series of analytic concepts. The central premise of Fear of Small Numbers is the puzzling proliferation of racialized majoritarianism, ethnonationalism, and ethnocide in even strictly democratic polities today. A mere 15 years past the end of the Cold War and the supposed “end of history”, how does one account for such an intensive resurrection of large-scale ethnocidal mobilization? From Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia, Chechnya, India, Sudan, and now the War on Terror waged by western liberalism against its ugly Other (and vice versa): how does one make sense of such rabid, large-scale, heterogeneous violence in the context of globalization, at the precise moment when one expects that the world is becoming more homogeneous? Appadurai’s answers the question thus: “where the lines between us and them may have always, in human history, been blurred at the boundaries and unclear across large spaces and big numbers, globalization exacerbates these uncertainties and produces new incentives for cultural purification as more nations lose the illusion of national economic sovereignty...",

      "abstract": "(International Seminar on Making of Gandhi, 10-12 March 2011, Shivaji Univ. Kolhapur) Abstinence is a voluntary act of restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure. Most frequently, the term refers to Sexual abstinence or abstention from alcohol or food. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions or practical considerations. Abstinence has diverse forms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities through “sublimation”. Abstinence may also arise from an ascetic element, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life",

      "abstract": "When people engage in discussion or debate, they do not only use spoken language to position themselves in the course of interaction: they use their bodies as well. In this paper, we take a systematic, corpus-based, bottom-up linguistic approach rooted in gesture studies and interactional linguistics to account for the possible functions of two types of gesture during stance taking in the course of human-human interaction: lateral head tilts and shoulder shrugs. The absolute or contextual direction of head tilts does not seem directly relevant to stance taking, but rather related to the pragmatic deictic function of abstract pointing. Shoulder shrugs can work as markers of \"dis-stance\" or disengagement, in which case they take on an epistemic-evidential dimension. Both gestures tend to be used when the gesturer either disaffiliates with third party positionings, or affiliates with his/her interlocutor's stances.",

This phenomenon, seemingly the expression of unconscious defense mechanisms, may be explained in various ways: as a consequence of losses related to aging; as regression in the service of the self; as an expression of the \"death instinct.\" Another level of reflection is concerned with the influence of the perception of time. Confronted by the curtailing of one's expectation of life, the aged person may unconsciously yearn for some kind of permanence, designed to conjure away the effect of passing time. We find such a process underlying rigidity, collecting, or hypochondria, which may be regarded as \"mechanisms of permanence.\" These strategies, although constituting for the aged person a defense intended, in fantasy, to preserve life, in reality constitute a trap that excludes life.",

Sleep is also cognitively and behaviorally rich, with different sleep stages supporting different kinds of memory processing as well as sleep behaviors ranging from subtle muscle twitches to seemingly goal-directed behaviors, as in sleepwalking, sleep talking, and rapid eye movement-sleep behavior disorder. Dreaming is notoriously heterogeneous, with different kinds of dreams having distinct phenomenological profiles. For example, lucid dreams, in which dreamers become aware that they are dreaming, often additionally involve the ability to control the ongoing dream. There is also variation in dreams from different participant groups. Dreams contain an average of 2–4 dream characters only one of these, at a given time, is experienced as the self. Self-other distinctions therefore play a central role in dreams: world simulation—both in a spatial and in a social sense—is necessarily grounded in the experience of a single self at its center.",

Galef has pointed out many times, unless one posits a new mechanism of learning not yet imagined by neurobiologists or learning theorists, the same mechanisms (here, the same neural machinery and processes) must of necessity mediate all forms of learning, social and otherwise, in the individual.Neurobiologists examine the ways neural systems work to achieve functional outcomes for the organism.Neurobiological models of learning span many levels of explanation, from the properties of receptors and membranes, to cell structure organization and patterned activity of circuits or regions.Can social learning be studied meaningfully at the levels of interest to the neurobiologist?Perhaps.It will be most interesting for both behavioral and neurobiologists if it can be.However, claiming something special for social learning at these levels requires distinguishing between social learning and \"normal\"",

      "abstract": "The body is the theater of the baby’s primary experiences. The sense of identity, which is connected with the perception of space and time, and develops through reciprocal exchanges with his human environment, is deeply rooted in the body-ego. In autistic states, the absence of any relationship with the external world, which implies the withdrawal from all dimensions of reality, including the perception of space and time, is inevitably mirrored in the child’s relation with his body. The elimination of any exchange includes the elimination of the sense of existing as a body and of inhabiting his body. Since the autistic child cannot bear any perception of existing as a separate individual, being unable to abandon the unconscious fantasy of fusional oneness, he cannot accept his body becoming a 'solid’ entity, since this process would lead to the perception that he is separated from his environment and that his skin represents the boundary between inside and outside. The defensive strategy of many autistic children consists in refusing this process of “solidification” at advanced psycho-physical levels. Their bodies, their movements, their behavior, tend to elicit in the therapist sensations of their being liquid, volatile or viscous, or on the contrary frozen, thus representing a further protective maneuver. The story of three autistic children in psychoanalytic therapy shows how they discovered their bodies and began to experience themselves as existing as a bodily reality in space, in time and in a relationship. This represented a crucial moment in the therapeutic process. In fact, the child’s discovery of his body and the experience of it being solidly contained in a three-dimensional space and in the therapist’s attention was the prerequisite for their psychic container to become able to perform its basic mental functions of projection and introjections.",

      "title": "The City is the Map: Exosomatic Memory, Shared Cognition and a Possible Mechanism to Account for Social Evolution",
      "abstract": "One role of the city is often overlooked.This is its role in providing a common setting for social action.This paper reviews research into the geometry and topology of urban built space and the way that these configurational structures appear to be appropriated for human individual and social purposes.It links economic, cultural and political domains of social action to the physical and spatial structure of cities.In doing so it points to those aspects of individual perception and cognition that must logically be assumed to be common between individuals, and so form a basis for the social.It proposes, following Bratman (1987), that our individual actions involve at least three distinct psychological dimensions: the beliefs we hold about the world we inhabit are substantially cognitive; our desires are affective or emotional; and our immediate intentions are guided by both desire and our beliefs about the world, for the most part through apparently rational behaviour.If on occasion our behaviour appears less than rational, this can usually be traced back to a misapprehension about the nature of the worlda cognitive deficitto the driving motivation being emotional, or to the apparently irrational outcomes of system dynamics involving feedback processes, for example in the operation of markets.It concludes by suggesting that an important part of our cognitive apparatus lies outside our bodies in the morphology of the environments we build and the way that we appropriate these for use.Since the construction and use of the built environment is distributed amongst many actors in a population, it is suggested that the environment of the city itself becomes a part of the shared cognitive capacity for communities, allowing these to behave as if a single organism from a cognitive point of view.This offers a possible mechanism to account for the rapid pace of human social evolution over the last 10,000 years.Amongst the more intriguing aspects of human history is that while our genetic make-up has not changed substantially in over a hundred thousand years, the social and technological world we inhabit today is so different to that of just a few years ago.This suggests that Darwinian evolution, subsequent to the emergence of homo sapiens, accounts for little of contemporary human progress; an account of progress must instead appeal to social, cultural and technological evolution.Let me pose the question like this: how is it that despite the fact that individuals in society live for just a few years, on occasion social forms, states and cultures can persist for centuries?At the same time, how is it that our social and cultural conditions can appear to develop rapidly and to change beyond recognition within just a few years?What mechanisms lie behind the diversity of social and cultural forms we observe and the way these are conserved and generated over time?There have of course been numerous attempts in the sociological and anthropological literature to catalogue social forms and to develop a theoretical basis for the field, however I would suggest that it is currently in an essentially pre-Darwinian and pre-Mendelian state in theoretical terms.No full and persuasive account has yet been made to suggest a mechanism for social evolution.Perhaps the most striking change over this period is in terms of the scale of the human group or polity.While early humans are thought to have lived in small bands or family groups numbering perhaps a few dozen individuals, cities today comprise tens of millions and the largest states such as China and India number well over a billion people.The scale of the polity or state seems to have gone hand in hand with technological progress, with each making the other possible: technological innovations support larger and denser populations, and large, dense populations speed innovation (Korotayev, 2006).It seems to be no coincidence that this feedback loop, and then the onset of rapid human progress, can be dated back to the first built settlements in the Anatolian plateau about ten thousand years ago.These came before writing and currency, and probably predate settled arable agriculture.Built settlements appear to have been a catalyst for a series of very rapid advances in society.This paper argues that the invention of the building and the settlement created a new stratum of cognitive machinery, outside the individual brain and body, and ultimately it is this that",

Because the use of signs in affecting behavior is dependent on a context of preexisting motives, beliefs, ethics, abilities and capabilities, ontic and epistemic difficulties relative to the complex interaction of distinct variables and relevant conditions to which each person has been subjected in his or her unique life, makes non-trivial explanations and predictions—ones not involving stereotyped or scripted behavior—theoretically impossible, including for the weakest forms of simulation. Indeed, even stereotypical behavior may not be predicable on similar grounds for real, historical human beings, not only in general but even for each single case. This study may even be viewed as an essay about freedom of the will.",

The author assumes that the period of conception and reproduction can stand out as a characteristic experience from among the daily stream of experiences. He also seeks to better understand the anthropological and psychological factors which come into play at the beginning of embryonic life. The author systematically describes 6 groups of phenomena which are especially characteristic of the reproductive process. They are the following: 1. The uniqueness of the reproductive event which is reaffirmed in each subsequent pregnancy. 2. The personal encounter with the new being and the change from a relationship between 2 individuals to a 3-way+ relationship. 3. The anticipation as a manifestation of the principle of hope. 4. Heightened sense perception resulting from changes in the psychosomatic organism which lasts up to 24 hours after the event mentioned above in 1. It is a joyful mood different from euphoria or the orgasm experience. 5. Necessity is the experience of a superpersonal force which leads the couple to union; it begins with the yearning for sexual congress without sexual feelings as the driving force in the otherwise sexual creature. Need and want are combined in the experience of necessity. 6. Indefinite time in contrast to time limit. This is the realization that the outcome of the procreative event lies somewhere indefinitely in the future.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study explores the primacy of interrelating and its ecopsychological significance. Grounded in evidence from everyday experience, and in dialogue with the phenomenology of Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, we discover that humans are inherently relational beings, not separate egoic subjects. When experienced intimately (not just conceptually), this realization may transform our (often pathological) interrelationship with the beings and presences in the community of nature. Specifically, interrelating is primary in three ways: 1) interrelating is always already here, transpiring from the beginning of the human species and human culture, from the beginning of every infant's life, and (most significantly) from the continuously arising beginning of every presencing moment; 2) the quality of our interrelating is truly what matters most, the most important expression of and facilitator of health, compassion, and justice for humankind and the rest of nature; and 3) interrelating is the ever-present path via which we discover/create and carry on our (inter)existence. Interrelating is an existential given—indeed we are our interrelating—yet we are summoned ethically to cultivate our way of interrelating so as to serve others and the non-human natural community. Thus interrelating is our essence, our calling, and our path.",

      "title": "Dynamic context discrimination : psychological evidence for the Sandia Cognitive Framework.",
      "abstract": "Human behavior is a function of an iterative interaction between the stimulus environment and past experience. It is not simply a matter of the current stimulus environment activating the appropriate experience or rule from memory (e.g., if it is dark and I hear a strange noise outside, then I turn on the outside lights and investigate). Rather, it is a dynamic process that takes into account not only things one would generally do in a given situation, but things that have recently become known (e.g., there have recently been coyotes seen in the area and one is known to be rabid), as well as other immediate environmental characteristics (e.g., it is snowing outside, I know my dog is outside, I know the police are already outside, etc.). All of these factors combine to inform me of the most appropriate behavior for the situation. If it were the case that humans had a rule for every possible contingency, the amount of storage that would be required to enable us to fluidly deal with most situations we encounter would rapidly become biologically untenable. We can all deal with contingencies like the one above with fairly little effort, but if it isn't based on rules, what is it based on? The assertion of the Cognitive Systems program at Sandia for the past 5 years is that at the heart of this ability to effectively navigate the world is an ability to discriminate between different contexts (i.e., Dynamic Context Discrimination, or DCD). While this assertion in and of itself might not seem earthshaking, it is compelling that this ability and its components show up in a wide variety of paradigms across different subdisciplines in psychology. We begin by outlining, at a high functional level, the basic ideas of DCD. We then provide evidence from several different literatures and paradigms that support our assertion that DCD is a core aspect of cognitive functioning. Finally, we discuss DCD and the computational model that we have developed as an instantiation of DCD in more detail. Before commencing with our overview of DCD, we should note that DCD is not necessarily a theory in the classic sense. Rather, it is a description of cognitive functioning that seeks to unify highly similar findings across a wide variety of literatures. Further, we believe that such convergence warrants a central place in efforts to computationally emulate human cognition. That is, DCD is a general principle of cognition. It is also important to note that while we are drawing parallels across many literatures, these are functional parallels and are not necessarily structural ones. That is, we are not saying that the same neural pathways are involved in these phenomena. We are only saying that the different neural pathways that are responsible for the appearance of these various phenomena follow the same functional rules - the mechanisms are the same even if the physical parts are distinct. Furthermore, DCD is not a causal mechanism - it is an emergent property of the way the brain is constructed. DCD is the result of neurophysiology (cf. John, 2002, 2003). Finally, it is important to note that we are not proposing a generic learning mechanism such that one biological algorithm can account for all situation interpretation. Rather, we are pointing out that there are strikingly similar empirical results across a wide variety of disciplines that can be understood, in part, by similar cognitive processes. It is entirely possible, even assumed in some cases (i.e., primary language acquisition) that these more generic cognitive processes are complemented and constrained by various limits which may or may not be biological in nature (cf. Bates & Elman, 1996; Elman, in press).",

      "abstract": "It is a paradox that during the years of psychosocial development each man has to achieve an identity, a role in which he can feel secure, and yet poets and philosophers tell us that man is forever seeking to diminish the isolation which a personal identity imposes. Without the development of a personal identity and a role in life the individual remains a social isolate, a dependent parasite or a social deviant. Yet, once achieved, identity brings a new awareness of separateness from others and a need to merge the self with others, to identify with someone or something else. This would seem to be a main objective of love. It has been said that human love is the supreme act of communication with another, a merging of identity, and poets speak of communicating with nature or with God in like terms. Romantic and sacred literature abound in metaphors and images describing the bliss which such activity offers. If it is true that while we have a need to develop a sense of personal selfhood, an identity and a role, we have a further need to diminish the separateness such awareness imposes, how do we go about it? The contemporary answer is, of course, by communication, by relating to others. The better the communication we have with others, the greater our sense of belongingness, the less the pain of individual isolation. It is not necessary to emphasize that a cardinal feature of all severe mental illness is either a loss or a distortion of the individual's communicative capacity. But I would like to emphasize that the debate as to whether failure of communication is either a cause, or an association, or a consequence of mental illness is not my theme.",

Similar things usually behave similarly, and because we can grasp these similarities, we can organize and predict the things in our world. Four major classes of models have been proposed for how humans assess similarities. In geometric models, entities are represented by their positions in a multidimensional space, and similarity is based on the proximity of entities in this space. In featural models, entities are described by their features, and the similarity of entities is an increasing function of their shared features and/or a decreasing function of their unique features. In alignment-based models, the similarity between two structured entities is calculated by placing the elements of their structures into correspondence. In transformational models, the similarity between two entities is conceptualized as the number of transformations required to transform one entity into the other. We discuss issues related to the flexibility and constraints of similarity, and how similarity grounds other cognitive processes.",

Motor praxeology: A new scientific paradigm. In Mariann Vaczi (ed.), Playing fields: Power, practice, and passion in sport, 127–144. Reno: University of Nevada Press). But what about the space in between? What kind of semiotics organisation can be detected in the membrane between player and liminal space where spectators are not allowed yet specific characters needed to carry out an event? We can therefore identify a liminality that can be connected either to the controlled or the wild playing field and depending on which of the two is the case can be analysed according to the degree of regulated system of signs which they produce. This implies different pathways and rituals: as matches are played, a variety of bodily activities may be taking place concurrently. Furthermore, it is inevitable that these activities attract the attention of the audience or alternately lead a player to interact with a non-player. In this article, I will first try to identify certain semiotics features, especially connected to Eco’s Peircian concept of Encyclopedia, that characterize the status of liminal space around the playing field. Then I will focus on liminality in soccer, investigating what kinds of interaction exist outside the playing area.",

      "title": "Why Humans Prefer Phylogenetically Closer Species: An Evolutionary, Neurocognitive, and Cultural Synthesis",
      "abstract": "Humans form deep attachments to some nonhuman animals, yet these attachments are unequally distributed across the tree of life. Drawing on evolutionary biology, comparative cognition, neuroscience, and cultural anthropology, this narrative review explains why empathy and affective preference are typically stronger for phylogenetically closer species—especially mammals—than for distant taxa such as reptiles, fish, or arthropods. We synthesize evidence that signal recognizability (faces, gaze, vocal formants, biological motion) and predictive social cognition facilitate mind attribution to mammals; conserved neuroendocrine systems (e.g., oxytocin) further amplify affiliative exchange, particularly in domesticated dyads (e.g., dog–human). Ontogenetic learning and media narratives magnify these effects, while fear modules and disgust shape responses to some distant taxa. Notwithstanding this average gradient, boundary cases—cephalopods, cetaceans, parrots—show that perceived agency, sociality, and communicative transparency can overcome phylogenetic distance. We discuss measurement (behavioral, psychophysiological, neuroimaging), computational accounts in predictive-processing terms, and implications for animal welfare and conservation. Pragmatically, calibrated anthropomorphism, hands‑on education, and messaging that highlights agency, parental care, or ecological function reliably broaden concern for under‑represented taxa. Recognizing both evolved priors and cultural plasticity enables more equitable and effective science communication and policy. Expanding empathy beyond its ancestral anchors is not only an ethical imperative but a One Health necessity: safeguarding all species means safeguarding the integrity of our shared planetary life.",

      "abstract": "English shame and German scham derive from the Gothic schama , ‘to hide, cover, conceal’. German Hemd (shirt) and English and French chemise are other derivatives. In some languages the word for ‘shame’ and the word for ‘wound’ are the same. A wound exposes and can thereby advertise vulnerabilty and a cause for shame. Hiding or covering may seek to guard against wounding, humiliating exposure. Shame is self-evidently an important human emotion. Insofar as animals are innocent of shame, experience of it is a mark of humanity. Much human behaviour is influenced by fear of shame and embarrassment. Living in the face and eyes, shame is very close to the experienced self. Self-image and self-esteem are heavily determined by one's susceptibility to shame. Experience of shame is impossible without a sense of individuation, without a sense of discreteness from the world and of being an object in the eyes of another. Study of shame sensitivity therefore offers many clues to an individual's or a culture's behaviour, sense of identity and relationship to the environment.",

Relevance Theory assumes that, ceteris paribus, humans are naturally inclined to help each other and therefore attempt to optimize the chance that their fellow creatures understand them. Given the folk wisdom that “a picture tells more than a thousand words,” we may be forgiven for thinking that visual communication, when possible, is always preferable to its verbal variety. We should not underestimate, however, how much background knowledge is presupposed in communication via pictures or other visuals. A visual message may thus misfire because its sender misjudges the background knowledge and values of the envisaged audience. A further complicating factor is that visual (and all other) messages come with varying degrees of commitment to the meaning conveyed, this meaning ranging from being fully explicit, via being strongly or weakly suggested, to being unintentionally transmitted. Unsurprisingly, visual communication is even more challenging when it straddles different cultures. After presenting a bare-bones introduction to Relevance Theory, I discuss a number of exclusively or partially visual messages that involve, in one way or another, intercultural communication.",

      "abstract": "The recognition of nonrigid motion, particularly that arising from human movement (and by extension from the locomotory activity of animals) has typically made use of high-level parametric models representing the various body parts (legs, arms, trunk, head, etc.) and their connections to each other. Such model-based recognition has been successful in some cases; however, the methods are often difficult to apply to real-world scenes, and are severely limited in their generalizability. The first problem arises from the difficulty of acquiring and tracking the requisite model parts, usually specific joints such as knees, elbows or ankles. This generally requires some prior high-level understanding and segmentation of the scene, or initialization by a human operator. The second problem is due to the fact that the human model is not much good for dogs or birds; for each new type of motion, a new model must be hand-crafted. In this paper, we show that the recognition of human or animal locomotion, and, in fact, any repetitive activity, can be done using low-level, non-parametric representations. Such an approach has the advantage that the same underlying representation is used for all examples, and no individual tailoring of models or prior scene understanding is required. We show in particular that repetitive motion is such a strong cue that the moving actor can be segmented, normalized spatially and temporally, and recognized by matching against a spatio-temporal template of motion features. We have implemented a real-time system that can recognize and classify repetitive motion activities in normal gray-scale image sequences. Results on a number of real-world sequences are described.",

According to Bryan and London (1970), altruistic behaviour refers to those behaviours which are intended to benefit another but which appears to have a high cost to the actor with little possibility of material or social Altruism is generally defined as any form of voluntary act intended to favour another without expectations of rewards (Smith & Mackie, 2000). It refers to a kind of selfless help, which is based on pure desire to help others (Aranson, Wilson, Akert & Fehr, 2004). Examples of altruistic behaviour cover a wide range including expression of support and sympathy, doing special favours to others, acts of generosity, active defence of the rights of deprived, engagement in voluntary activities for the mentally and physically handicapped and martyrdom. It is a desire to help others which expresses itself in many ways through sympathy, philanthropy, etc. A person with strong altruistic want has affection and concern for others and is usually contrasted with the selfish person. According to Hamilton (1978), altruistic behaviour which helps only the recipient can be distinguished from other types of intra specific social interactions, for example, cooperative behaviour which helps both parties, selfish behaviour which helps the donor only, and spiteful behaviour in which both parties lose. Altruistic behaviour involves helping, sometimes, even taking great risks even though the act is not likely to be rewarded, recognized or even appreciated. Thus, an altruistic act is selfless. The same has been stressed by Walster and Piliavin (1972) who say that altruism is [a] very special form of helping behaviour that is voluntary, costly to the altruist and motivated by something other than the expected one of material or social reward. Altruism then is selfless rather than selfish. Yarrow Scott and Walter (1973) point out that is not a specific form of behaviour rather it includes a diversity of responses such as helping, sharing, rescuing, sympathizing and undoubtedly more.The term, deprivation, has stemmed from the verb, 'to deprive', which means to dispossess or strip off an individual from certain things. It, thus, implies a felt loss. It indicates a state of certain deficiencies experienced by the individual which relates to certain features of the environment that are absent or inadequate in certain degree which cause an impact on the functioning of the individual. Thus, when one states of deprivation, the emphasis is on the relevant aspect of the environment which are deficient or wanted in some respects (Sinha, 1982). Nurcombe (1970) stated that deprivation refers specially to a disposition or loss of privileges, opportunities, material goods and the like which occur with reference to three interrelated sets of basic needs-physical, psychological and socio - cultural.Altruism is a trait found in everybody. However, individuals differ with regard to depending upon several factors. Social psychologists hold the view that is indeed not inborn but a learned trait. Children can learn to be altruistic, friendly and self-controlled by modelling and socializing. Therefore, age is an important determinant of across the life-span. It has been observed that children become more prosocial with age (Berndt, 1985; Chou, 1998; Collins & Getz, 1976; Eisenberg, 1982; Rai & Gupta, 1996; Sharma, 1996). In a recent study, Ojha and Pramanick (2010) found that with advancement of age increases significantly. But there are also studies which do not reveal age related effects on altruistic behaviours (Green & Schneider, 1974; Lowe & Richley, 1973; Midlarsky & Hannah, 1985). Studies directly related to the effect of environmental deprivation on are few and far between. …",

      "title": "Personal Reactive Attitudes and Partial Responses to Others",
      "abstract": "This paper argues for a new understanding of Strawson’s distinction between personal, impersonal, and self-reactive attitudes. Many Strawsonians take these basic reactive attitude types to be distinguished by two factors. Is it the self or another who is treated with good- or ill-will? And is it the self or another who displays good- or ill-will? On this picture, when someone else wrongs me, my reactive attitude is personal; when someone else wrongs someone else, my reactive attitude is impersonal; and when I wrong someone else, my attitude is self-reactive. Against this account, I argue that the basic reactive attitude types are better distinguished according to whether they express partial or impartial concern. This fits Strawson’s discussion in “Freedom and Resentment”, and it allows us to see an important point that the alternative approach obscures. Namely, while attitudes like resentment, gratitude, shame, and pride can arise as responses to our own treatment and behavior, they can also arise as third-party responses to the treatment and behavior of our family members, romantic partners, and close friends. Similarly, attitudes like moral indignation and disapprobation also have a wider scope than is often acknowledged; they can arise as responses to others’ treatment, but they can also arise as responses to our own treatment when we react impartially to circumstances involving ourselves.",

Though useful information might lie in the “collected data” (animal mind), extracting them into insightful knowledge with human-accessible form (clear meaning, no interpretation) presents a demanding and sophisticated undertaking.

      "title": "De Bello. Can We Withdraw from the Logic of War?",
      "abstract": "Where human beings are no longer bound by the necessitarian solidarity of the struggle for survival, they must cultivate a reflection on the effects of language at the very root of their structuration, and therefore on their functioning – both as parlêtres uti singuli and as collectivities. The psychoanalytic clinic practice has shown, ever since Freud, that the human being is profoundly de naturalized by language: unlike animals, humans have turned nourishment, species reproduction, and the struggle for existence into something other than mere instinct. Every deed, word, or thought circulates through a symbolic re working – that is, through culture; in other words, through the symbolic order, that is, through language. Since the word is not the thing, language inscribes in every parlêtre a structural lack of being – a lack that inexorably propels the speaking being to seek its filling. Unless one reflects on the structural nature of this lack – and its inherent unfillable quality – one may fall into the futile attempt to saturate it with various objets (petit a), which, as elements of a different logical register, can never truly erase it. The wars waged by peoples throughout history over territorial possession are nothing but doomed attempts at erasing this linguistic effect on man. From that standpoint, the functioning of the individual is in no way different from that of a collectivity. Aggression erupts if one fails to transform this structural lack into more than deprivation – namely into an opportunity for invention and the discovery of new perspectives. Once aggressivity enters the dominant discourse, the next step is war – since aggressiveness and war are modes of jouissance for the speaking being. As such, they are ineradicable. From this perspective, it is essential that those entrusted with steering states come to an intimate – and disturbing – recognition: man is not what he wishes to be, but what he is. Nothing whatsoever can be built upon a misreading of the Real.",

      "abstract": "What is meant by “method” in the sciences? The English word derives from the ancient Greek methodos, which has its roots in the idea of being crafty or cunning. Later for the Greeks it came to mean “the pursuit of knowledge” or “a way of enquiry” (literally “way of pursuit”). For us moderns it has a wider usage. The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that a method is a way of doing something in accordance with a plan, or a special procedure; or it is a regular systematic way of either treating a person or attaining a goal. It is also a systematic or orderly arrangement of topics, discourses or ideas. In general one can speak of a method for gutting and filleting fish, baking a cake, wiring a fuse box, surveying a given piece of landscape, conducting a funeral or cracking a safe. Not following the prescribed method usually leads to a botched, or socially unacceptable, outcome. There are also methods for teaching languages, for example, the immersion method; there are methods for teaching the violin to the very young, for example, the Suzuki method; there are methods for learning and playing curling, or a nose flute; and so on. In general there are methods whereby one can not only best teach or learn a given subject, but also present an effective case in a law court, write up a report, conduct an orchestra or a meeting, and so on.",

It is the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm others; it is not the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm no one but ourselves. In Mill’s classic formulation: the sole end from which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.... The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over him self, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.",

At that time the view had emerged and, in the interest of scientific respectability for the new psychology, had gained wide acceptance, that behaviour was best explained solely in terms of observable stimulus and response events. A representational system need not be limited to relating a series of locations to each other in space but can operate upon behavioural and environmental events, organizing them in terms of the temporal and/or causal relationships which exist between them. An important part of the environment for the majority of animals consists of other animals, and salient characteristics of these other creatures are potentially available for inclusion into representational frameworks. Effective modelling of a social group should include a representation of the modeller himself as his own presence and actions affect group dynamics.",

The rationality or irrationality of emblems is going to depend on the aim of the politics that they symbolize as well as the consequences that the identities have. Finally, whether political or identitarian they will become closer; although they are two closely related phenomena, they have very different implications. Starting with the political aspect, when what had to be represented was not rational, emblems would have become crystallisers of irrationality. Emblems have, amongst many other things, the following peculiarities: a) they reflect closed contents, closed mes- sages; b) they are synthetic, they technically respond to syncretism (a little of everything). Consequently simplistic or reductionist; c) they serve to crystallise those closed messages, to fix them; d) they imply an assessment of tradition and that which is traditional which could go further than any logic; e) they fundamentally use the persuasive technique of repetition; and f) as they have coded symbolism, they reduce the need to think critically. Humans are territorial animals and defending territory means boosting identity. With everything that is considered symbolic. We are like this and everyone should know we are like this. And everybody else should also know it.

      "title": "The Principles of Education",
      "abstract": "EDUCATION covers the span of life from the cradle to the grave. Impressions are received in bits and blocks in an endless stream. Some of these pass almost at once into oblivion, leaving the merest trace in our minds. Other impressions, stimulating more or less interest through partial or anticipated connection with something already in our minds, are seized upon, inspected and then, if found true and worthy, tagged and pigeon-holed with other associated impressions. An occasional new impression of unusual strength will dominate a whole group of old impressions. The mind then makes abstracts (ideas) of groups of impressions to connect with abstracts of other groups. The best measure of mentality is probably this tendency to interconnect and abstract the essential ideas in a wide variety of other ideas and groups of impressions. And mentality in this sense is a measure of the degree of education in an individual. The impressions of an infant are limited to those received from its immediate surroundings. During school days, the mind receives and assimilates ideas from farther afield not associated with desire or discomfort. Later on, in high school and college days, the mind likes and readily assimilates groups of abstract related ideas and even probes the infinite and unknowable. In middle life, the dominant interest lies in the practical problems of everyday life. The field of our activities is our school and the newspaper and magazine our text-books. The mind demands fresh facts and new ideas. In later life, after the details of most minor problems have become familiar, interest turns once more to general principles, and larger problems, details are reduced to routine when possible. In short, education is as long and as broad as our lives. National welfare requires that it be recognized and treated as such. What we now call education is a mere generalization of parental instruction covering the period of most active interest in the most abstract ideas. Real education in the interest of the nation should be such as to develop and bring into action all the latent possibilities in every individual. Whatever our useful activities at any period of our lives, we should be continually receiving and assimilating new ideas with both bodies and minds fresh and active, with a code of ethics firmly established and a philosophy of life equal to any emergency.",

By refusing to inhabit a material, internal space, homeless people demonstrate, in concrete terms, the lack of an internal world capable of holding their anxieties. Mother's physical presence is sought in the proximity of the baby's personal body-space, and her emotional ability to contain anxiety is sought as a taking-in of a good object into the developing internal space of thought and feeling.",

      "title": "Animacy and Affectedness in Germanic Languages",
      "abstract": "Abstract This paper deals with the influence of animacy on affectedness. German, like other Germanic languages, requires oblique marking of the inanimate undergoer argument of verbs of contact by impact (e.g. hit, kick, bite), whereas the animate undergoer argument takes non-oblique marking. Inanimacy does not necessarily result in oblique marking; undergoer arguments with inanimate referents are realized in a non-oblique construction if a change of state or location is explicitly predicated, as in resultative constructions. This suggests that the marking of inanimate undergoer arguments is conditioned by two factors: animacy and affectedness. The basic claim is that animate and inanimate entities are affected differently by hitting, kicking and similar activities. Inanimates can only be physically affected, whereas animates can be psychologically affected as well. Since verbs of contact by impact do not entail a change of state/location, they do not represent their undergoer arguments as being (necessarily) physically affected. Hence, the potential psychological effect of hitting, kicking and the like on animate beings gives rise for interpreting animate undergoer arguments of those verbs as being affected.",

      "title": "Art as Adaptation: A Challenge",
      "abstract": "Joseph Carroll knows literary Darwinism not only through breaking in field but also from helping so many newcomers over fence, myself included. I agree with almost everything he writes in bulk of article, but since we learn more from disagreement, I will take issue with one section, The Adaptive Function of Literature. Carroll's account of my own proposal seems to me inaccurate, and his own proposal seriously wanting. I have proposed that art is a human adaptation deriving from play, a widespread animal behavior.45 Play evolved through advantages of flexibility, of behavior not fully programmed genetically; amount of play in a species correlates with its flexibility of action. Behaviors like escape and pursuit, attack and defense and social give-and-take can make life-or-death differences. Creatures with more motivation to practice such behaviors in situations of low urgency on average fare better at moments of high urgency. Animals that play repeatedly and exuberantly hone skills, widen repertoires and sharpen sensitivities. Play therefore has evolved to be highly self-rewarding. Because it is compulsive, animals engage in it again and again, incrementally altering muscle tone and neural wiring, strengthening and speeding up synaptic pathways, improving their capacity and performance. Humans uniquely inhabit the cognitive niche (Tooby and De Vore). We therefore have an appetite for information, and especially for pattern, information that falls into meaningful arrays that allow rich inferences. Like other species, humans can assimilate information through rapid processing that specialized pattern recognition allows, but unlike other species we also seek, shape and share information in open-ended ways. We actively pursue patterns that make data swiftly intelligible, especially those yielding richest inferences in our core information systems, senses of sight and sound, and our most crucial domain, social information. Art is a kind of cognitive play with pattern. Just as play refines behavioral options over time by being self-rewarding, so art serves as a playground in which mind increases cognitive skills, repertoires and sensitivities. Like play, art succeeds by engaging and rewarding attention, since more focused our attention and more frequent and intense our response more powerful neural consequences.46 Art's appeal to our preferences for pattern means that we expose ourselves to high concentrations of humanly appropriate information eagerly enough so that over time we strengthen neural pathways that process key patterns in open-ended ways. Other functions follow from this. Individuals who can earn attention of others through art gain in status. Emotional attunement in cognitively appealing forms improves social cohesion, as does creation of engaging prosocial models. Fiction can create scenarios for reasoning about action in ways that earn attention, emotion and recall. Art can be appropriated by religion, to intensify traditions and social commitments, but it can also foster creativity, especially in large communities with high specialization of labor. Carroll critiques creativity as if it were prime function I propose for art, when in my account it comes in fifth, and explicitly only because other functions are already in place. I find it hard to understand Carroll's proposal, so let me quote what I take to be his core claims: art organiz[es] motivational systems disconnected from immediate promptings of instinct. . . . The proliferation of possibilities in 'mental scenarios' detached from instinct produces a potential chaos in organizing motives and regulating behavior. The arts produce images of world and of our experience of world. Those images mediate our behavior and elemental passions that derive from human life history. Carroll rests much of his case on an appeal to authority of E. …",

      "abstract": "WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS TO STUDY a festival, fair, or other occasion in which a number of folklore genres may be observed in intimate interrelation, he is quickly made aware of two serious shortcomings in his conceptual equipment. First, he finds that he has no good way of describing the different phenomena, at least in the equivalent terms necessary to make clear interrelations and differences of the genres. Instead, each has always been described in terms of itself, as a unique entity. This, of course, is the classic problem of genre study, a problem that has so far stymied any attempt at a good critique of such mixed genres as opera in literature and music, or the festival in folklore. Second, the folklorist finds that he possesses no given methodology for assessing the relative importance to the whole of any particular event or action. Closely related to this is the frustrating awareness, which quickly dawns on him, that he has no way of knowing what the significance of the particular acts he witnesses may be. In short, the meaning of the procession or the dancing or the singing is not evident on the face of it and cannot be deduced on the basis of the empirical evidence. As a result, all too often the folklorist describes the festival in terms of his own reactions, emphasizing, for example, the striking elements, the (to him) quaint and curious aspects. At the very best, the most that a folklorist can hope to do, if he has not arrived at some sort of solution to this problem, is to weigh all the elements equally. This again is an unsatisfactory solution, though perhaps it furnishes the least distorted ethnography. In the course of a Peruvian fiesta, a boy will show a friend how to hold a skyrocket so as not to get burned when it goes off. A father will tell his children the story of the discovery of the patron saint's image. A young man will dance with a girl, and two middle-aged men will do the same dance together. Players of reed flutes and panpipes play for the dancers, who in turn sing traditional songs of praise to the village saint. There is a procession, a feast, and a multitude of accounts of miracles, of penances, and reminiscences of past fiestas. All these",

      "abstract": "This paper argues that the agent-based simulation approach is just the one appropriate to the social sciences (including economics). Although there were many predecessor approaches, which tried to build formal models of social systems, all of them fell short of the peculiar features of the objects of all social sciences: complex systems consisting of numerous autonomous actors who interact with each other, who take on different roles at the same time, who are conscious of their interactions and roles and who can communicate with the help of symbolic languages even about the counterfactual.\r\n\r\nThese human actors are unlike physical particles although their behaviour might sometimes be quite similar to the behaviour of physical particles when humans occur in very large numbers (but they are most interesting when they form only small networks). Real human actors would not concede that their behaviour is stochastic, they will always assert that their actions are deliberate (but at the same time these actions are not entirely predictable). Human actors are not entirely rational although their behaviour might sometimes seem as if they were (but they are most interesting when their rationality is only bounded and when their payoff is multidimensional).\r\n\r\nSocial systems seem to be the most adaptive systems that we know about, and this is why we could perhaps use them as patterns for artificial adaptive systems --- and if we knew enough about the modes of operations of human social systems, social sciences could even contribute to agent-based modelling in other fields.",

      "title": "The External Person, a 'Procrustean Bed' of the Inner Person. Notes of Applied Psychoanalysis in Decadence Literature",
      "abstract": "In the Modem Age, the individual prefers logical-abstract relationship with reality of any form, sacred or transcendent. Nevertheless, the alienation from the wholeness, divinity, unconsciousness led to break in the modem man's communication with himself. Thus, the man started to become aware of an immense inner emptiness, both at individual and social level; not knowing anymore who he is, where he comes from and where he leads to, he feels confused in an over-technological society, substitute for lost wholeness: through scientific understanding, our world has become dehumanized. Man feels himself isolated in cosmos. He is no longer involved in nature and he has lost his emotional participation in natural events ... No river contains spirit, no tree means man's life, no snake is the embodiment of wisdom, and no mountain still harbors great demon. Neither do things speak to him nor can he speak to things, like stones, springs, plants, and animals. His contact with nature has been lost, and so has that profound emotional energy springing from this symbolic contact.2Starting in France at the century's turn, the Decadence is based on models of romantic irrationalism. Refusing the positive view (according to which the science and reason could guarantee an objective knowledge of reality), the decadent considers that all these cannot offer him the real knowledge of mysterious and enigmatic reality. Therefore, giving up reason, the Decadence replaces the objective reality questioning the unconsciousness of dark area where the individuality is taken as an unconscious remote wholeness. Because of this, we can state that the real target of Decadence is the discovery of the unconsciousness dimension.As the mystery - the secret essence of reality - cannot be deciphered by reason and science, the decadents will try to reach it through other instruments: dream and nightmare, hallucination and delirium, disease, neuroses and dementia. Thus, the decadent heroes have complicated, sinuous psychology, dominated by contrasts, and this new status leads to the psychological novel.At the peak of the American Decadence, Edgar Allan Poe infers and describes the inner conflict of the modem man, confident in the scientific and rational discoveries, at the same time being incredulous when thinking of his existence and his world existence.What characterizes Poe consists of gloomy and sensational elements, reminding of the English novel from the late 18th century, Gothic and dark. The short existence (40 years) of the American writer proved to be deeply troubled. Being in constant conflict with others, he finds refuge in art. Thus, his writings are works in which the author examines the harsh compensatory both external life (mutilated picture if we think of the Red Death Mask) and the inner turmoil, the thirst for knowledge, exploring the mysteries of the inner world.Poe's The Mask of the Red Death (1842) begins with description of the bleak and hopeless disaster of plague. It makes its presence felt everywhere by sharp pain, meaning people and places by redness and the horror of blood.Despite all these troubles, Prince Prospero was happy, bold and lively, serenity and his optimism do not give up even when more than half of his servants die from the epidemic. Confident in fate, he chooses a thousand strong and brave friends among the knights and ladies in his court and retires to seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys, figment of the prince himself.The author mentions that once you are here, courtiers stuck locks to prevent 'entry or exit of despair' caused by outside or inside insanity.The castle shows the projections of the unconscious, where memory is stored (memory), subjective contributions of functions, affects and unconscious irruptions. Thus, in the castle, the Prince gathered all that can delight the man: clown, comedians, dancers, musicians, wine, and reassurance. …",

      "title": "Learning, specialization, efficiency and task allocation in social insects",
      "abstract": "One of the most spectacular features of social insect colonies is their division of labor. Although individuals are often totipotent in terms of the labor they might perform, they might persistently work as scouts, fighters, nurses, foragers, undertakers or cleaners with a repetitiveness that might resemble an assembly line worker in a factory. Perhaps because of this apparent analogy, researchers have often assumed a priori that such labor division must be efficient, but empirical proof is scarce. New work on Themnothorax ants shows that there might be no link between an individual's propensity to perform a task, and their efficiency at that task, nor are task specialists more efficient than generalists. Here we argue that learning psychology might provide the missing link between social insect task specialization and efficiency: just like in human societies, efficiency at a job specialty is only partially a result of \"talent\", or innate tendency to engage in a job: it is much more a result of perfecting skills with experience, and the extent to which experience can be carried over from one task to the next (transfer), or whether experience at one task might actually impair performance at another (interference). Indeed there is extensive circumstantial evidence that learning is involved in almost any task performed by social insect workers, including food type recognition and handling techniques, but also such seemingly basic tasks as nest building and climate control. New findings on Cerapachys ants indicate that early experience of success at a task might to some extent determine the \"profession\" an insect worker chooses in later life.",

These were originally part of a hardwired, phylogenetically adapted, nonverbal information system for implicitly conveying information about these states both among and within individual members of the species. A classification system provides two major functional classes of emotions, (1) those serving as Appetitive Wishes toward objects, and (2) those serving as Beliefs about the status of fulfillment of those and other significant wishes. Thus, emotions such as Anger and Fear indicate a wish to attack or escape from some object or situation, while Love and Surprise indicate wishes to care about or explore an object or situation. Emotional wishes, like their somatic brethren, require Consummatory Acts for their fulfillment. The result of these acts are emotions such Anxiety and Depression, which indicate Beliefs that the relevant wishes will be hard or impossible to satisfy, or Contentment and Elation, which function as Beliefs that the wishes have been or are being fulfilled. Together, emotional wishes and beliefs form a comprehensive wish-belief information feedback system with manifold causal consequences.",

Nearly as widespread as aversion to the act is one supposed consequence: the corpse is believed to become reanimated. Drawing on a variety of cases, this article describes the distribution of the idea both in ritual practice and myth and establishes its fundamental form. Consideration is given to how far the representation can be traced to cross-culturally common features of mortuary ritual and common ideas about spiritual entities and non-human animals. As none of these approaches sufficiently accounts for the disapprobation or the concomitant belief in reanimation, it is then shown how an explanation can be found in equally widespread and possibly universal tendencies of human cognition, including an experience of newly deceased persons as incompletely dead and therefore transitional between life and death, and an association, expressed in many different languages, of traversal with transgression.",

Secondly, information and knowledge must be complete, that`s to say ,both sides do all know that cooperation can bring return to themselves and say the other also has this knowledge .Human`s symbiosis has two basic types: exchanging cooperation and organizing cooperation .The former is to stipulate common abidance by action rule in the way of negotiating equally when copartners go in for their respective aim that may be often different or even has conflict, and than increases both return on the base of not hurting other`s return. The latter is to found organization,such as enterprise ,family ,party ,and so on. We can define organization as some people (at least two people)`s set that`s charactered by hierachical structure ,they all obey the same system ,realizing common aim. So the latter has a common aim while the former has not; the rule followed by the former is often formed spontaneously while the latter often follows a deliberate rule. From the hypothesis of economic person, the factors that people decide cooperation or not and choose which kind of it can be classified into two types : communication return and communication cost.Communication return in exchanging cooperation includes Pareto improvement from exchanging, comparative return from dividing the work and equal large charge from status equality.To governer or manager, communication return in organizing cooperation is matter surplus produced from governee or managee, in other words, the right of coming down on surplus, and it is the large charge from the right of governing or managing. To governee or managee, they can adopt two attitudes: submitting or resisting . There is dividend of submitting.Communication cost can be divided into two types, one relates to exchanging cooperation, which includes market exchanging cost, and also includes the cost paid by negotiating alliance of different parties in democracy politics .The other relates to organizing cooperation. To manager, the exchanging cost in organization is managing organization cost mainly, including founding cost and maintaining cost of organization.All kinds of composition, for example, net exchanging cost (it is equal to exchanging cost minus exchanging return) minus net managing organization cost(it is equal to organization cost minus managing dividend) ,and net resisting cost (it is equal to resisting cost minus resisting dividend ) minus net submitting cost(it is equal to submitting cost minus submitting dividend or submitting opportunity return), determinate whether people will choose cooperation attitude or non-cooperation attitude, and then will choose which kind of cooperation ,equality negotiation or organization.",

To illustrate this, let's look at a crawling infant's fascination for a bouncing ball. Initially, the ball is not experienced as part of the infant's self, but the influence of self-reflectivity becomes explicit when the child is approximately two years old. When playing with another child, it may shout: “Ball mine!” The child has developed a special relationship with the ball, considering himself its “possessor.” The ball falls within an invisible boundary between Mine and not-Mine. The child's definition of himself as the possessor not only indicates that the self is explicitly involved, it also has immediate repercussions for the affective processes both between the child and the ball and between the child and others. Still later, when the child has become a member of a sports club, he may consider himself a “good soccer player” and feel very proud of this. This self-evaluation indicates that the child, being able to adopt the complex language-games of a community, applies to himself a particular standard which is, as an organizing principle, accepted by a group or community. In Mead's (1934) terms, the child is organizing his self by “taking the role of the other” and his feelings are also organized by this role-taking.",

      "abstract": "Indicators with long social histories, such as the Consumer Price Index, often serve as nodes of calculative infrastructures. They create a field of social action, making some relations between people, institutions, and materials possible, and other relations less possible. By reflecting on two experiments in do-it-yourself sensor data, this article explores the tensions that occur when indicators have not yet become stable entities. When the conditions of possibility for the indicator's continued existence are less assured, the labor it takes to build numbers into something socially meaningful becomes surprisingly visible. This labor proceeds in stops and starts, as the various material and epistemological and social resistances reveal themselves. Sensors shape these starts and stops. Sensors give their users an indication of a possible whole entity whose contents they cannot fully imagine, and either must create or abandon. Far from producing certainty, sensor data often provokes a sense of vagueness that is worked on until it becomes either clarity or action, failure or indifference. Through this view of numbers in the making, we can see just how remarkable it is that indicators become part of calculative infrastructures at all.",

If we want to look beyond the high languages of Persian, Sanskrit, and Tamil, with their established protocols and vocabularies of knowledge, where do we look, and what and who are we likely to find? Should we look only at individual “great thinkers,” systematic philosophies or genres that are recognizable as “philosophy” or as śāstra ? Or, for Indian as for African languages, should we look for ideas in the languages themselves and in genres in which ideas have been discussed, be they proverbs (as repositories of received, often contrasting, ideas), or song-poems, sermons, anecdotes, fictional narratives, letters, records of conversations like Sufi malfūẓāt , and so on—whether “philosophical ideas” are expressed explicitly or are implicit in their arrangement? This essay offers four initial suggestions about what the appropriate and available genres for an intellectual history in Indian languages may be.",

      "title": "Gesture–speech unity",
      "abstract": "This paper outlines an argument for how development in child speech and gesture could shed light on language evolution: child acquisition can be thought of as two types of acquisition, one of which goes extinct (gesture-first, Acquisition 1) and is replaced by another (gesture–speech unity, Acquisition 2). For ontogenesis, this implies that children acquire two languages, one of which is extinct, and which again goes extinct in ontogenesis (it continues as “gestures of silence” rather than as gestures of speech). There is no way to get from Acquisition 1 to Acquisition 2. They are on different tracks. Even when they converge in the same sentence, as they sometimes do, they alternate and do not combine. I propose that the 3~4 year timing of Acquisition 2 relates to the natural selection of a kind of gestural self–response I call “Mead’s Loop”, which took place in a certain psychological milieu at the origin of language. This milieu emerges now in ontogenesis at 3~4 years and with it Mead’s Loop. It is self-aware agency, on which a self-response depends. Other developments, such as theory of mind and shared intentionality, likewise depend on it and also emerge around the same time. The prefrontal cortex, anchoring a ring of language centers in the brain, matures at that point as well, another factor influencing the late timing. On the other hand, a third acquisition, speech evoking adult attachment, begins at (or even before) birth, as shown by a number of studies, and provides continuity through the two acquisitions and extinction.",

      "title": "A Traumatic Intrusion with Transgressive Possibilities power as a relational and discursive phoneomenon",
      "abstract": "Therapy in one way or other has always been about subversion - whether it was the undermining of symptoms, the provision of a transitional space for the considering of serious changes in one's life, a space for political conversations with social ramifications or more recently the co-creation of a space where the transformation of consciousness might take place. All of these aspects of therapy are about disrupting the habitual, the unseen and the conditioned in our personal and social lives. As such, one could posit that therapy, to be true to its spirit, is transgressive of the taken for granted - those conditioned responses which both keep us going and challenge us to transform. In that way, all change is in part a transgressive act. In our moves to evolve or co-evolve there needs to be a going beyond a previous positioning (Simon 2007). This special issue is a celebration of such an evolution and transgressions by many courageous beings in their own small and larger ways of living out a life of difference on the margins. Indeed this marginal siting cannot be but transgressive as they illuminate that which marginalises in the first place. This paper also relates to a transgression of a small kind. For many years I had worked with metaphors and experiences of marginalisation, power, gender inequality, abuse and victimisation. These categories seemed quite clear until the intrusion that is described here entered my life and home. What follows is my attempt at deconstructing previous clarities and restorying a lived experience of ambiguities in relation to power and powerlessness. I will explore a power saturated and personally traumatic event as a relational enactment. I have chosen to explicate my own experiences this time as for most presentations and papers, I speak as a professional working with clients who have experienced trauma. However, on this occasion I thought I would take a reverse position and address my own trauma which I first wrote about (for myself) in the immediate aftermath of the event described.",

      "title": "Animal Navigation: A Synthesis",
      "abstract": "Navigation, the ability to organize behavior adaptively to move from one place to another, appeared early in the evolution of animals and occurs in all mobile species. At the simplest level, navigation may require only movement toward or away from a stimulus, but at a more sophisticated level, it involves the formation of complex internal representations of the environment, the subject's position within it, the location of goals, the various routes from current position to goal and possible obstacles along the way. The vast array of navigational capabilities in various species has made it challenging for students of comparative cognition to formulate unifying frameworks to describe and understand these capabilities, although the variety also confers an exciting opportunity for asking comparative questions that are hypothesis driven. A unifying framework, the navigation toolbox, is proposed to provide a way of formulating common underlying principles that operate across many different taxa. The toolbox contains a hierarchy of representations and processes, ranging in complexity from simple and phylogenetically old sensorimotor processes, through the formation of navigational primitives such as orientation or landmark recognition, up to complex cognitive constructs such as cognitive maps, and fi nally culminating in the human capacity for symbolic representation and language. Each element in the hierarchy is positioned at a given level by virtue of being constructed from elements in the lower levels and having newly synthesized spatial semantic contents in the representations that were not present in the lower levels. In studying individual species, the challenge is to determine how given elements are implemented in that species, in view of its particular behavioral and anatomical constraints. The challenge for the fi eld as a whole is to understand the semantic structure of spatial representations in general, which ultimately entails understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms by which semantic content is synthesized from sensory inputs, stored, and used to generate behavior. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies.

      "abstract": "The wor d, w h eth er spok en or w r i t t en, h a s a pa rt icu l a r r el at ion-ship to the senses and to the sensations that we feel. The spoken word appeals most obviously to the sense of hearing while the written word is perceived through sight, sometimes aided by touch in the case of inscriptions, for example. But the reception of both individual words and verbal messages (whether in the form of speeches, poems, or simple conversations) sets in motion processes that are both intellectual and sensual. Beyond its immediate sensory appeal, the word can convey information both about perceptible entities (people, objects, architecture) and about the experience of perceiving them, both for members of the same community and, later, for historians such as ourselves in search of information about perceptions and the senses. However, talk about perceptions is not merely informative for, in addition to telling the reader or listener about the impact made on both body and mind through the senses, words can themselves evoke responses. They can create the impression in readers or listeners that they are perceiving the entity that is described or, what is more, feeling as they would if they were in the physical presence of that entity or if they were performing the actions described. This dimension of language, although often overlooked in modern critical studies which, understandably , prefer to focus on more objectively observable features of texts, was widely acknowledged in ancient and Byzantine rhetoric and discussed under the headings of enargeia, ekphrasis, and hupotyposis. It has also been brought to light by several recent studies of the ways in which the brain reacts to language , suggesting that hearing about objects and actions stimulates parts of the brain involved in the physical interaction with those objects or in accomplishing the actions.1 I will approach the twin topics of how words create an illusion of sensation and of the nature and quality of the resulting experiences through a selection of different texts from the fourth to the ninth century, not in order to construct a history of linear development, though I think that there are important changes that take place in the use and conception of appeals to the senses, but primarily in order to explore some different uses of such appeals and the differing relationships between the word, the virtual sensation that it creates, and reality, whether that reality is understood as sensible, intelligible, or both. 1 Action words especially have this effect.

      "title": "De-pathologizing love in therapeutic care: Attending to an unwitting hermeneutical violence",
      "abstract": "This paper addresses the nature of pathologization in general and the pathologization of love in therapeutic care in particular. “Pathologized or pathologization[u1] ,” means an event, person, action, thought, feeling, or circumstance that is de-valuated as “less than,” as compromised or broken, and unwittingly (ironically, in the name of love) demeaned, belittled, ignored, jettisoned or ostracized for its not-enough-ness, its incorrectness, or its inadequacy in light of rank-ordered scales of measured worth. The pathologist presumes an essentialist hegemony [ctsq2] should be healthy love, consequentiality, views any expression less than this prescription as a privation or pathologization of healthy love, and is thus immature, ill, or unethical. Common ways therapists pathologize love in therapeutic space include the use of a modified against nature argument; which today is reframed as an against the status quo argument. The use of inflection and body language that communicates disapproval are, enacting[u3] ideologies of deficit-correction that inherently stigmatize, interpreting expressions of love “as other than it is,” or, “as nothing but something else,” such as adoration interpreted as really dependency or teenaged pining as merely raging hormones. Essentialist rank-ordered scaling inherent in these forms of pathologization is deconstructed, then explored in terms of the impact of this deconstruction in therapeutic care. The essay is concluded[u4] with suggestions of how to care for expressions of love in non-pathologizing ways within therapeutic space.",

      "title": "The Effects of an Ecological Diversifying Experience on Creativity: An Experimental Study",
      "abstract": "Sometimes, life houses rare and unexpected events, such as moving abroad or meeting a special person unexpectedly. Recently, these situations have been indicated as \"diversifying experiences\" (DEs), defined as unusual and unexpected events that drag people outside their daily routine and accustomed schemas. The core mechanism of DEs would entail the disruption of our mental schema, which can facilitate unexpected connections among even distant ideas, thus enhancing people's cognitive flexibility, that is, a key component of creative thinking. Despite both qualitative and lab-based studies have investigated the features of these experiences, an ecological assessment of their properties also in relation with creativity is still an open issue. The aim of this research is to study the DE-creativity link in a more ecological way, on the basis of a real-life disruptive experience of light deprivation. Specifically, we compared an ecological DE artistic established entertainment format (i.e., \"dialogue in the dark,\" which is seeing people perform several daily life activities but in the absence of light) with an equivalent experience in which the same activities were acted in the sunlight. The absence of light played the role of violating mechanism, framed within the ecological experiential format of the \"dialogue in the dark.\" We compared visitors' emotional profile [Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), ad hoc Adjective Checklist], perceived impact of the experience [Centrality of Event Scale (CES)], and creative performance [Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT)] in both groups of sighted people (in absence of light vs. in presence of light); and we also controlled for people's openness to experience and need for cognitive closure, as dispositions. Results showed that (vs. control group) \"dialogue in the dark\" (i) led to worse creative performances, (ii) produced more intense positive affect, and (iii) resulted as a more impacting experience. Intense short-term impact of DE could have been detrimental for participants' creativity. People may need more time to elaborate the DE and accommodate existing schema to generate more creative ideas. This is the first study proposing and succeeding in demonstrating the feasibility to investigate even real complex DEs in a controlled way, thus outlining how their link with creativity can take place in real life.",

      "abstract": "Intentional states can be understood as involving content and a particular attitude taken towards that content. States that involve a cognitive attitude, such as beliefs, play an epistemic or guiding role, and have a mind-to-world direction of fit – they are correct if the intentional state matches the world. States that involve a conative attitude, such as desires, play a motivational role, and have a world-to-mind direction of fit – the world must be made to match the content of the mental state. Episodic memory and sensory imagination are intentional states that represent events or states of affairs that are absent, not present. But what direction of fit do memory and imagination possess? Memory, like belief, seems to have a mind-to-world direction of fit. Our memory is successful or correct if it matches the (past) world. Yet is this direction of fit also characteristic of imaginings? I suggest that some forms of imagination play a guiding role and share this mind-to-world direction of fit with memory. Yet other varieties of imagination, such as many instances of episodic future thinking, seem to have a world-to-mind direction of fit. Many episodic future thoughts function like desires, in that one seeks to shape the world to fit with how one imagines it. These conative imaginings, I suggest, play a motivational rather than a guiding role in our cognitive economies, and they involve a distinct kind of attitude to episodic remembering.",

      "title": "Always One Bit More, Computing and the Experience of Ambiguity",
      "abstract": "Fun is often understood to be non-conceptual and indeed without rigour, without relation to formal processes of thought, yielding an intense and joyous informality, a release from procedure. Yet, as this book argues, fun may also be found, alongside other kinds of pleasure, in the generation, iteration and imagination of operations and procedures. This chapter aims to develop a means of drawing out an understanding of fun in relation to concepts of experience in the culture of mathematics and in the machinic fun of certain computer games. Mathematical concepts of experience, as something to be effaced, in terms of the grind of churning out calculations, understood as an acme of human knowledge bordering on the mystical or something both prosaic, peculiar and thrillingly abstract have been crucial to the motivation and genesis of computing. Experience may be figured as something innate to the computing person, or that is abstractable and thus mobile, shifting heterogeneously from one context to another, producing strange affinities between scales – residues and likeness among computational forms that can occasionally link the most austere and mundane or cacophonous of aesthetics. Among such, the fine and perplexing fun of paradox and ambiguity arises not simply in the interplay between formalisms and other kinds of life but as formalisms interweave releasing and congealing further dynamics. There are many ways in which mathematics has been linked to culture as a means of ordering, describing, inspiring or explaining ways of being in the world, but it is less often that mathematics thinks about itself as producing figurations of existence, and such moments are useful to turn to in gaining a sense of some of the patternings of computational culture.",

What is surprising is how little proxemics are used to mediate people's interactions with surrounding digital devices. We imagine proxemic interaction as devices with fine-grained knowledge of nearby people and other devices -- their position, identity, movement, and orientation -- and how such knowledge can be exploited to design interaction techniques. In particular, we show how proxemics can: regulate implicit and explicit interaction; trigger such interactions by continuous movement or by movement of people and devices in and out of discrete proxemic regions; mediate simultaneous interaction of multiple people; and interpret and exploit people's directed attention to other people and objects. We illustrate these concepts through an interactive media player running on a vertical surface that reacts to the approach, identity, movement and orientation of people and their personal devices.",

      "title": "Computing relationships and relatedness between contextually diverse entities",
      "abstract": "When presented with a pair of entities such as a ball and a bat, a person may make the connection that both of these entities are involved in sport (e.g., the sports baseball or cricket, based on the individual's background), that the composition of the two entities is similar (e.g., a wooden ball and a wooden stick), or if the person is especially creative, a fancy dress ball where someone has come dressed as a bat. All of these connections are equally valid, but depending on the context the person is familiar with (e.g., sport, wooden objects, fancy dress), a particular connection may be more apparent to that person. From a computational perspective, identifying these relationships and calculating the level of relatedness of entity pairs requires consideration of all ways in which the entities are able to interact with one another. Existing approaches to identifying the relatedness of entities and the semantic relationships that exist between them fail to take into account the multiple diverse ways in which these entities may interact, and hence do not explore all potential ways in which entities may be related.\n In this thesis, I use the collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia as the basis for the formulation of a measure of semantic relatedness that takes into account the contextual diversity of entities (called the Related Article Conceptual Overlap, or RACO, method), and describe several methods of relationship extraction that utilise the taxonomic structure of Wikipedia to identify pieces of text that describe relations between contextually diverse entities. I also describe the construction of a dataset of museum exhibit relatedness judgements used to evaluate the performance of RACO. I demonstrate that RACO outperforms state-of-the-art measures of semantic relatedness over a collection of contextually diverse entities (museum exhibits), and that the taxonomic structure of Wikipedia provides a basis for identifying valid relationships between contextually diverse entities. As this work is presented in regard to the domain of Cultural Heritage and using Wikipedia as a basis for representation, I additionally describe the process for adapting the principle of conceptual overlap for calculating semantic relatedness and the relationship extraction methods based on taxonomic links to alternate contextually diverse domains, and for use with other representational resources.",

      "title": "\"You Are Not Beppo\": Elizabeth Bishop's Animals and Negotiation of Identity",
      "abstract": "To rethink the animal is to rethink the human. This tenet, supported by an interdisciplinary consideration of animal/human relations, informs an examination of how the representation of animals in Elizabeth Bishop's writings contributes to a taxonomy of selfhood and a imagination sympathetic to difference. ********** To rethink the animal is to rethink the human. Another tenet of myriad implications asserted by philosophers, art critics, sociologists, biologists, and ethologists is that animals are like and unlike us (Midgley 1; Berger 2; Franklin 9): like us enough to be useful in experimentation for human benefit, unlike us enough to deflect concern on their behalf; like us in sentience and will-to-be; unlike us, many assume, in lack of intellect and moral agency. Cultural and literary practices often reinstate such hierarchies of animals' coexistence with the human, representing them as totemic scapegoats; amoral creatures of sensation and sexuality; a lower order to be dominated, sacrificed, destroyed, consumed, petted, and ignored. In these paradigms, the animal defines the human by antithesis, as other, the beast to be conquered by enlightened civilization. Rethinking the potential of the animal thus means rethinking mindedness and physicality, domination and ethics, otherness and identity; it involves, as philosopher Mary Midgley explains, of childhood and maturity, and the human race's general view of itself in relation to the physical universe (7). Questions of likeness and unlikeness, paradigms of identity, and relations to others and the physical world pervade the writings of Elizabeth Bishop, frequently through the guise of imagined creatures and common animals: Man-Moth, Fish, Armadillo, Sandpiper, Pink Dog, and Moose. (1) Viewed through recent philosophical, environmental, and ethological considerations of the human/animal connection, Bishop's works reveal that hierarchical concepts of animal-as-less are deeply embedded. Anthropocentric assumptions underlie apparently sympathetic depictions, particularly when identification with an animal conveys a destabilized abject self, as outlined in the theories of Julia Kristeva. On the hand, the writings express spontaneous attraction to animals. Then the reassuring presence of birds, dogs, chickens, and cows contributes to a taxonomy of selfhood, as described by ecologist Paul Shepard. These animal passages suggest the presence of a literary form of neoteny. In biology, neoteny means the retention of juvenile traits into maturity, including mental plasticity and curiosity; in a broad sense, neotenous beings retain openness to the unfamiliar--a characteristic conveyed by Bishop's childlike response to distinctive creatures. It is animals' seemingly dual nature--the lowly beast and the marvellous playmate--that informs a construction of self that reconciles the abject and appealing, the physical and psychic, and the childish and mature. The animal, in Bishop's writing and in contemporary thought, inspires perceptions of the other that allow for sympathetic connection in the face of difference. Identity is difficult to fathom with a writer initially known for discretion and objective description, who shied away from literary cliques and grandstanding, whose later writings and biographies disclose a figure lonely, suffering, and sickly. Bishop scholars have noted troubled sense of self, which emerges in the poetry through resistance to a dominant I, ambivalence to female presences, and closeting of sexual desires (Zona 69; Goldensohn 46; Diehl 101; Paton 206). While reticence may be refreshingly free of self-indulgent ego, it can also veil insecurity and distress (Merrin 2). Marilyn Lombardi connects the poet's struggles with asthma, alcoholism, and lesbianism to a private habit of self-recrimination: her detailed confessions of weakness [in unpublished writings] reveal a morbid streak to imagination that is judiciously suppressed in public persona (6). …",

      "title": "Designing for social cohesion",
      "abstract": "The concepts that helps us to get grip on how we make sense of the world or the way we give meaning to our lives is essential for the field of design, since designers produce proposals for action and experience through their designed artefacts. They create opportunities through which person can create meaning in specific socio-cultural context. Within phenomenology, ‘embodiment’ and ‘skilful coping’ are considered to be unique characteristics of man; that is, we are able to engage with the world and develop skills while acting in the world. We perceive the world in terms of what we can do with it, and by physically interacting with it we access and express this meaning. To cope skilfully in the world from day to day, we do not need mental representation of our goals; our body is simply solicited by the situation to find the right balance so as to gain maximum grip on the situation (Merleau-Ponty, 1962; Dreyfus 1996). These notions of embodiment and skilful coping did not only arise in philosophy, but also in other fields like psychology, anthropology, pedagogy and biology, across different cultures. Within embodied cognition for example, Lucy Suchman argues that people do not execute an internally created ‘plan for action’, but they act in the face of concrete circumstances in the world: situated action (Suchman, 1987; van Dijk, 2013). The concept of affordance plays an important part in the sensorimotor perspective on embodied cognition. James Gibson (1979), with his ecological theory of perception, introduced the concepts of affordances and effectivities to show that the characteristics of the human world (e.g. what affords walking on, squeezing through, reaching, etc.) correlate with our bodily capacities and acquired skills, that is our effectivities (Dreyfus, 1996). Related to this notion of affordance is Fransisco Varela’s notion of enactment, i.e. a process whereby living being creates and maintains its own domain of meaningfulness, in generating and maintaining its own self-identity as an embodied organism. (Torrance, 2006, p. 359). In other words, the we inhabit does not exist before we come to inhabit it: each creature, based on its sensory capacities and its behavioural repertoire, brings forth both itself as well as its environment (Von Uexkull, 1934). The user ‘enacts’ world of meaning by interacting through the artefact. Essential element for making sense of the world is the sensorimotor coupling between person and its environment (Van Dijk, 2013). But how can these theories help us to get grip on activities like communication, social connection and creativity? How can embodiment, skilful and enactment help designers to connect people and to catalyse constructive (design) conversation among people with different backgrounds? During two-weeks class with Master students of the Department of Industrial Design at the Eindhoven University of Technology, we developed so-called Engagement Probes, i.e. open tools which serve as means to connect people and enhance engagement, empathy and respect. We used these Probes to engage people in design discussion more concrete and effective than discussion or brainstorm session held around table. During the class, student developed six Engagement Probes that have been validated in five-hour workshop, in which 80 participants from very different cultural and professional background have used them as means to ignite design process. The results show that the Probes stimulate engagement, help people to get familiar and connected in short period of time, and inspire and boost the design process. In this talk I will discuss the development process of the Engagement Probes, the theoretical embedding, and the qualities of the designs that contribute to social interaction and engagement.",

I should here like to understand 'representation' in an obvious sense, i.e. as a technical term for sensory and neurophysiological processes. For it is not only since Descartes that epistemology has been accompanied by medical models attempting to provide a material basis for psychological phenomena. This is true quite in·· dependent of the arguments of the various philosophical schools. I have spoken of 'interdependence.' On the one hand, emotions somehow seem to be influenced by the physiological channels of expression to which they are allotted -where) according to contemporary science, they get their energy from) how they connect with ideas) how they associate among themselves, what effects they produce in the mind, the body, and the sense organs. One feels in a different way depending on whether one locates the source of these feelings in the humours produced in the abdomen or in the nervous system weakened by advancing civilisation to name the two significant options for the 18th century. On the other hand, the history of these physiological illustrations recapitulates and assimilates the history of emotionality. However materialist the physiologists may portray themselves, they in fact invent physiological processes in order to base on them the actual emotional experiences that arc typi·· cal of their period.",

      "abstract": "Evidence for the survival of some component of human consciousness, individual or collective, after bodily death is discussed at three levels: (1) the physical (i.e., neurophysiological) level of the psychic sensitive; (2) the level of the manifestations of the psychic 'sensitives', including direct voice communication, out of body experience, recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis, automatic handwriting, ectoplasmic materializations, psychic healing, including psychic surgery, absence healing, paintings of the 'other side' done in trance, and psychometry; and (3) the level of content of communications, including the Rosemary Records, Cross Correspondences, and the musical compositions of Rosemary Brown. The following conclusions may be drawn from the data presented: (i) that death as an extinction is an illusory concept; (ii) that individual human entities survive physical death; (iii) that these individual human entities retain at least some knowledge of their physical experiences; (iv) that these individual human entities can continue to learn after physical death; (v) that laws are apparent which contradict, or which occur outside, the range of our physical laws of space, time, and even mass; (vi) that the 'dead' have communicated with the living; and (vii) if one further applies the premise that if the basic pattern of human fate is the same, and that if one person survives bodily death, everyone does, then some component of human consciousness survives bodily death.

Becoming indignant passes through pity, for if one does not feel pity why would one become indignant (just as the revolt of someone who feels himself to have been offended passes through self-pity, which helps explain the constraints on its public expression). But pity is transformed by indignation. It is no longer disarmed and powerless, but acquires the weapons of anger. It is in this sense that we can say that it points toward action since anger, which is an emotion of actors, prepares or – as might be said in the Sartrean terms of a denunciation of emotional bad faith – simulates commitment in a situation in which it could be realised in actions. What kind of actions would these be? Quite clearly, of a violent kind. But this violence at a distance, and so without any physical contact, is condemned to remain verbal.

Whether in the context of RHI or OBE, since the participant passively receives visuo-tactile stimulations, body image appears only with the sense of ownership (SoO), not with the sense of agency (the registration that we are the initiators of our actions; SoA)^6,7^. Insofar as self-consciousness as a body image is a unity acting in its environments, body image has to be investigated in the relationship between SoO and SoA^8,9^. It requires an experimental condition in which SoO and SoA can be independently separated in an active condition. However, no experimental condition that is opposite to RHI and OBE in which a subject can feel SoA but not SoO has been proposed to date^10^. Here, we show that a person loses SoO for his own hand that he can freely move by his own will when he sees himself in a lateral view through a head mounted display. It was previously thought that SoO can be represented by synchronous inter-modal stimulations^10^, and that SoO appears to be complemented by SoA11. Our findings show that SoO can be lost under a synchronous visuo-proprioceptive condition while SoA can be maintained. SoO and SoA are two aspects of body representation, and similar dissociations have been proposed in various contexts, such as body image and body schema^12,13^, and 'Acting I' and 'Mine'^14^. Our result suggests that the two-centric-self consisting of SoA and SoO can enhance dynamically robust self-consciousness.",

Même “le test objectif de la vérité” se réduit au test par “l'expérience fondamentale individuelle,” c'est-à-dire, la douleur, le toucher, et la vision. Ni le groupe social, de l'un côté, ni un composant quelconque de l'individu, tel que l'organe ou la cellule, de l'autre côté, ne peuvent être ainsi fondamentaux à la vérité; parce que, malgré les similarités entre les organisations de l'individu, de la société, et des composants de l'individu, respectivement, il y a des différences importantes. Les individus peuvent vivre en dehors de la société, comme la société ne peut pas vivre et comme les composants de l'individu peuvent rarement vivre en dehors des individus eux-mêmes; les composants des individus, bien qu'essentiels au développement de la vérité, ne sont pas encore ceux qui tiennent la vérité; et la société en elle-même ne peut voir et jouir de la vérité. Cette vue permet les vérités acceptables, en effet, les vérités socialement acceptables, pourvu que leur test définitif soit admis comme individuel; et la vue permet l'organisation collective, la “décision,” et l'action; car la vue donne à entendre et la liberté intellectuelle pour les individus, et l'intérêt individuel dans les intérêts communs. Referat Dass die Wahrheit, wie wir sie kennen, eine Entwicklung ist, die Veränderung ausgesetzt ist, folgt aus der Geschichte und der Logik. Sogar der “objective Prüfstein der Wahrheit” lässt sich auf den Prüfstein der “individuellen Grunderfahrung” zurückführen, d.h. Schmerz, Tast, und Gesicht. Weder die soziale Gruppe einerseits, noch irgendeine Komponente des Individuums, wie ein Organ oder eine Zelle, andererseits kann die Grundlage der Wahrheit sein, weil es trotz den Ähnlichkeiten zwischen dem Aufbau des Individuums, der Gesellschaft und der Komponenten des Individuums wichtige Unterschiede gibt. Individuen können von der Gesellschaft getrennt leben, wie die Gesellschaft nicht leben kann, und wie die Komponenten des Individuums selten von den Individuen selbst getrennt leben können; Komponenten der Individuen, obgleich sie zur Entwicklung der Wahrheit wesentlich sind, sind nicht die Besitzerinnen der wahrheit; auch kann die Gesellschaft für sich die Wahrheit nicht wahrnehmen und geniessen. Diese Ansicht gestattet natürlich annehmbare Wahrheiten, ja sozial annehmbare Wahrheiten, insofern ihr Urmerkmal anerkanntermassen individuell ist; und die Ansicht gestattet Gruppenaufbau, “Entschluss,” und Tätigkeit; denn die Ansicht schliesst in sich sowohl die intellektuelle Freiheit für die Einzelwesen als auch individuelles Interesse an gemeinsamen Interessen.",

      "abstract": "When someone asks us to explain something, such as how a lever or balance scale works, we spontaneously move our hands and gesture. This is also true for children. Furthermore, children use their hands to discover things and to find out how something works. Previous research has shown that children’s hand movements hereby are ahead of speech, and play a leading role in cognitive development.Explanations for this assumed that cognitive understanding takes place in one’s head, and that hand movements and speech (only) reflect this. However, cognitive understanding arises and consists of the constant interplay between (hand) movements and speech, and someone’s physical and social environment. The physical environment includes task properties, for example, and the social environment includes other people. Therefore, I focused on this constant interplay between hand movements, speech, and the environment, to better understand hand movements’ role in cognitive development.Using science and technology tasks, we found that children’s speech affects hand movements more than the other way around. During difficult tasks the coupling between hand movements and speech becomes even stronger than in easy tasks. Interim changes in task properties differently affect hand movements and speech. Collaborating children coordinate their hand movements and speech, and even their head movements together. The coupling between hand movements and speech is related to age and (school) performance. It is important that teachers attend to children’s hand movements and speech, and arrange their lessons and classrooms such that there is room for both.",

      "abstract": "According to the standard account of forgiveness, you forgive your wrongdoer by overcoming your resentment towards them. But how exactly must you do so? And when is such overcoming fitting? The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel version of the standard account to answer these questions. Its core idea is that the reactive attitudes are a fitting response not just to someone’s blameworthiness, but to their blameworthiness being significant for you, or worthy of your caring, in virtue of your relationship to it. Someone’s blameworthiness is significant for you to the extent you’re bound up with what grounds it––e.g. with the wrongdoer’s being a participant in human relationships, with their attitudes, or with the victim’s being a source of demands. So you may fittingly not care about someone’s blameworthiness if it’s sufficiently insignificant for you in this manner––e.g. if their wrong happened far off in place and time. And forgiveness revolves around this. You (fittingly) forgive your wrongdoer if and only if, partly out of goodwill towards them, you (fittingly) cease to care about their blameworthiness––a bit as if their wrong had happened far off. If I’m right, this agent-relativity-based account can resolve the apparent ‘paradoxy of forgiveness’ (Kolnai 1973), satisfies a number of desiderata, and is plausible on an intuitive level.",

      "abstract": "ed from it, are learned. Its expression is mediated through the central nervous system and, in particular, through the integrating properties of the cortex. Every species, therefore, has its set of limits, which perceptually represents the possible input from the environment and whether the organism can handle this input. Thus, animals that cannot synthesize light signals into three-dimensional images differ anatomically and physiologically from those that can. Much of the discussion of culture presents comparative material from man and the lower animals. Many examples can only be analogies, since comparable work is not available for man-either because it has not yet been done or because it cannot properly be done within ethical limitations. The use of such evidence derives from the fundamental assumption that there is a continuity of process across species, however significant the differences in detail. Provided one is careful to establish both the similarities and the differences, extrapolations can be a fruitful guide to hypotheses which can be experimentally tested. The beststudied and perhaps the most striking such analogy (but in no sense the only one) is the way in which spatial distance is utilized not merely to make interaction possible, but also to set in motion particular emotional-interactional patterns, specifically the initiative and dominance variables. The investigation of culture might properly be called cultural anthropology (or for that matter, social anthropology, if these terms are considered equivalent-as they are not in England, for example) provided its area of concern is distinguished from behavioral anthropology as here defined. This investigation is twofold. First, it is built upon a systematic use of the science of learning, dependent to a large extent upon, but by no means limited by, what psychology has so far contributed. Second, it concentrates on the logical systems special to each of the cultural dimensions into which culture can be divided. These logical systems are based on criteria other than those of the natural sciences. The assumptions-and the logical combinations which result-may be economic or mechanical, or both, in the case of the technology of the work flow; they may be perceptual and architectural in the case of space. In communication, there are logical systems based on color and form, on properties of sound and rhythm, on symbolic logic or visual concordance. Combining these two main areas of inquiry, cultural anthropology can explicitly concern itself with the constraints within which the human animal lives, constraints which one can no more exclude from the behavioral side than one can study a fish as a functioning organism and ignore the ocean within which he swims.

Anything that more or less satisfies these conditions I call a secondary mental entity. Secondary mental entities fall into three moderately distinct subcategories. They are (i) sensations proper such as pains, tickles, and itches; (2) emotions proper such as anger, fear, and exhilaration; and (3) perceptionrelated entities such as sense data, images, and afterimages. Those of the third category are obviously more theory-dependent notions than those of the other two; and my calling the members of all three categories entities should be taken initially as only a convenient way of speaking and not as an endorsement or denial of any particular theory as to their nature or existence. In the empiricist tradition in the philosophy of mind, secondary mental entities have usually been taken to be the very essence, or at least paradigmatic, of the realm of the mental while states of consciousness have been largely ignored. (Or, perhaps it would be more nearly accurate to say that many have supposed that states of consciousness can be exhaustively analyzed by secondary mental entities.) For this lamentable state of affairs there are very good historical and very poor philosophical reasons; or so at least I have argued in detail elsewhere.'

While sociable interaction centers upon persons, it can occur only if the more serious purposes of the individual are kept out, so that it is an interaction not of complete but of symbolic and equal personalities.

      "abstract": "A few scholars, like Floyd W. Matson in The Broken Image and A. H. Maslow in The Psychology of Science, have discussed the “two cultures” of science and human experience. They point out that many persons tend to talk and act as though human experience (e.g., spontaneity, play, creativity) has nothing whatever to do with science. Or, perhaps it is more accurate to say that science rejects such determinants of human behavior. Similarly, to some persons the idea of being systematic and the idea of being creative seem irreconcilable. Is this always necessary? The method described does not imply that “great” creative products will necessarily result. However, by using Fisher's factorial notion it is possible to generate a large number of fresh communication messages with this technique. Such messages can be audience-centered, and can be designed for any public medium. A specific example demonstrates how new television program ideas can be created. The ingredients of content and style within the new program ideas are empirically related to recent audience studies, so such programs are expected to maximize the satisfaction for respective segments of the audience. The description of step-by-step procedures illustrates how the “systematic” and “creative” orientations can be meaningfully and productively integrated.",

      "abstract": "Spoken language, as we have it, requires specific capacities-at its most basic advanced vocal control and complex social cognition. In humans, vocal control is the basis for speech, achieved through coordinated interactions of larynx activity and rapid changes in vocal tract configurations. Most likely, speech evolved in response to early humans perceiving reality in increasingly complex ways, to the effect that primate-like signaling became unsustainable as a sole communication device. However, in what ways did and do humans see the world in more complex ways compared to other species? Although animal signals can refer to external events, in contrast to humans, they usually refer to the agents only, sometimes in compositional ways, but never together with patients. It may be difficult for animals to comprehend events as part of larger social scripts, with antecedent causes and future consequences, which are more typically tie the patient into the event. Human brain enlargement over the last million years probably has provided the cognitive resources to represent social interactions as part of bigger social scripts, which enabled humans to go beyond an agent-focus to refer to agent-patient relations, the likely foundation for the evolution of grammar.

The space can be classified into corporal, gestual and visual. Spatial activity includes different types of movements of body parts or the entire body in space. Visual information plays the crucial role in spatial experience. It is processed from the retinal level to the associative cortex. Hearing is less important. Tactile and kinesthetic senses are important for the gestual space and body pattern. In the domain of spatial cognition, the capacity of abstract manipulations with spatial information is important. This includes mental rotation, orientation and selective attention. the right perietooccipital region is most important for the spatial function. Spatial tasks may be solved by verbal (more frequently in women) and visuo-spatial strategy (more common in men).

      "title": "Improving English Instruction through Neuro-Linguistic Programming.",
      "abstract": "Your greatest responsibility is to become everything that you are, not only for your benefit, but for mine. Leo Buscaglia (1982, p. 264) Today, instructors are teaching the components of English, but not how to effectively learn it. Teachers use a variety of instructional techniques, but again, not how to comprehend what is taught. our students are to gain a place in the world as the best possible communicators using the English tongue in this age of No Child Left Behind, educators must use every possible tool; and neuro-linguistic programming is such a tool in the arsenal of learning. Basic theory states that each time the section of the brain referred to as the hypothalamus (located in the basal ganglia, third ventricle) experiences stimuli, it transports the nerve signals to differing sections of the brain and thinking occurs. The brain then thinks in terms of sensory experiences of pictures, feelings, sounds, smells, and tastes. The electro-chemical reactions and electrical discharges occur in the brain when information is stored; thinking occurs while receiving stimuli causing automatic responses--physiological and muscular reactions--unconscious communication (Helm, 1989. pp. 254-255). Basically, behavior is communication. Watzlawick (1967) indicated that this is cognitive behavioral communication which simply means--How we think results in how we behave; and all behaviors are the communications that lead to how we are thinking, non-verbal communications, and body language. According to the writer (Helm, 1989), the instructor must establish whether the student is communicating primarily through visual, auditory, or kinesthetic means (Please note individuals communicate in all three modalities, but they stress one more than the others so as to establish the ideal communication modality. This step involves observing the student's eye movements (Bandler and Grinder, 1979). Assume the student is right-handed (The following will be true in 80 percent of the right-handed people to be observed.) (Helm, 1989, p. 255). When asked appropriate questions (Figure 1) if the student is visual, he/she will look up to the right to create an answer and up to the left to remember information; if auditory, he/she will look towards his/her right ear to create ideas or to the left ear to recall ideas; and if kinesthetic, he/she will look down to the right if he/she is thinking in emotions and down to the left if he/she is creating or talking to himself/herself. One may also distinguish the modality the student is operating in by the way he/she stands--if visual, straight; if auditory, a telephone posture; and kinesthetic, slumped. Vocally, a visual person has a loud, high, fast tempoed voice; an auditory person has a mid-range, even tempoed rate of speaking; and the kinesthetic person has a soft, low slow tempoed vocal quality (Helm, 1989, p. 255). Once the student has been determined to primarily belong to the visual, auditory, or kinesthetic communication/learning modality, the instructor will divide the class into appropriate groups. All of the planning and instruction will be based around joining each individual and his/her respective group through the appropriate linguistics as instruction takes place. As to linguistics (Helm, 1989), the object is to match the predicates (verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) (Figure 2) of the student according to what he/she says in accordance to the pattern established through his/her eye movements and other cues. For example, if one was saying, I am enjoying your If visual, he/she might say, I like how your paper looks; if auditory, Your paper has a nice sound to it; and if kinesthetic, I feel good about your paper. When standing in front of a class as an instructor, he/she should stand to the left of the class when giving an intellectually-oriented presentation so that he/she will be speaking towards the student's right ear and into the left side of the brain; and stand to the right if the presentation involves right-brain input (enhances auditory learning, also). …",

      "abstract": "Communication is very essential for each and every individual person, because it allows us to express our feelings, sentiments, and ideas etc. Humans can communicate with one another through a variety of means, including natural language, body language, and even writing. People who do not have any disabilities, such as hearing or speaking impairments, can use all of the foregoing modes of communication to communicate with other normal people. Natural language, which includes words, sentences, and so on, is the most often utilized type of communication by normal people. On the other hand, People with disabilities use Sign Language to communicate with others. Deaf and dumb people comprehend sign language easily and quickly, but it is difficult for them to communicate with normal people who do not understand sign language. Deaf and dumb persons are unable to effectively convey their feelings and thoughts to other normal people due to hearing and speaking issues, which is a serious problem all over the world. To address this issue, numerous systems were developed that interpret sign language (Hand movements, facial expression etc.), recognize signs (Hand Gestures), and display the relevant text on the system, allowing normal people to understand the language of the deaf and dumb. The fundamental purpose of this survey paper is to read all of the methods that were used in various systems and to identify the most efficient method that can be adopted in future research work.",

      "abstract": "Postural control has been defined as “regulating the body’s position in space for the dual purposes of stability and orientation.” How the body achieves postural control depends, in part, on the environment. A person navigating a non-moving surface (e.g. hallway, stairway, or step ladder) will process information and will employ different strategies to maintain postural control than someone who is standing or walking on a moving surface (e.g., forklifts, personal transportation systems, escalators, and moving walkways). In both environments, sensory, cognitive, and motor control systems contribute to postural control. The musculoskeletal system uses muscle activation and joint positioning to control the body’s alignment and muscle tone. The biomechanics of postural control rely on information that the musculoskeletal system receives from sensory systems including the vestibular system, which is generally implicated in behaviors requiring balance control, as well as the somatosensory and visual systems. Furthermore, sensory information from these and other systems can be enhanced by cognitive processes, such as attention. The ability to maintain postural control while standing or walking is critical in preventing falls on both non-moving and moving surfaces. This review focuses on moving surfaces and includes a discussion of the biomechanical, perceptual, and cognitive factors responsible for postural control.",

At the heart of this inquiry is a proposition that certain somatic or neurological conditions are fundamentally unidentifiable, unrecognizable, invisible, and thus cannot be made manifest in absence of some broader interactions with technology, media, and the built environment. In this essay, I bring together the history and sociology of medicine, media studies, and disability studies to argue that by studying these questions, we can open up new ways of understanding what the body once knew and now does not, and what it might one day know that it does not know now, thereby reframing what counts as illness or disability.",

They talk about society in a way as if it shares same attributes with human being: can be sick (as if it has body), can think (as if it has mind), can speak (as if it has mouth), for example. It is quite obvious that this gesture implies a view of society as an agglomeration of individuals.

      "title": "Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm",
      "abstract": "ions. But reducing the ego to intuitive immediacy — anchoring it in mere animality, in the ‘bounds of nature,’ or in ‘natural law’ — would amount to ignoring the fact that the ego is the product of an ever-formative history, indeed, a history that, if it is to consist of more than mere episodes, must avail itself of reason as a guide to standards of progress and regress, necessity and freedom, good and evil, and — yes! — civilization and barbarism. Indeed, an anarchism that seeks to avoid the shoals of sheer solipsism on the one hand and the loss of the ‘self’ as a mere ‘interpretation’ one the other must become explicitly socialist or collectivist. That is to say, it must be a social anarchism that seeks freedom through structure and mutual responsibility, not through a vaporous, nomadic ego that eschews the preconditions for social life. Stated bluntly: Between the socialist pedigree of anarcho-syndicalism and anarchocommunism (which have never denied the importance of self-realization and the fulfillment of desire), and the basically liberal, individualistic pedigree of lifestyle anarchism (which fosters social ineffectuality, if not outright social negation), there exits a divide that cannot be bridged unless we completely disregard the profoundly different goals, methods, and underlying philosophy that distinguish them. Stirner’s own project, in fact, emerged in a debate with the socialism of Wilhelm Weitling and Moses Hess, where he invoked egoism precisely to counterpose to socialism. ‘Personal insurrection rather than general revolution was [Stirner’s] message,’ James J. Martin admiringly observes41 — a counterposition that lives on today in lifestyle anarchism and its yuppie filiations, as distinguished from social anarchism with its roots in historicism, the social matrix of individuality, and its commitment to a rational society. 38Max Stirner, The Ego and His Own, ed.

Coordinating change at many different rates and at many different levels of organiza­ tion, these interacting and history-dependent open systems exhibit and contribute to a range of phenom ena related to remembering. But how do they incorporate and act on the basis of their pasts? By what m echa­ nisms, and through what m edia do traces shape the behavior of these systems? Such general questions abstract away, for sure, from the specific neural or affective or interpersonal or organizational features that compose and flavor m em ory processes in particular individuals and collectives. One critic complains that “the positing of a weakly defined type, generic memory . . . subsum ing both internal and external states and processes” will not be of significant explanatory use (Rupert, 2004). Others think that my search for an integrated framework w ithin which quite different memoiy-related phenom ena m ight be understood is “a social research Vol 75 : No 1 : Spring 2008 23 non-revolutionary approach to embodied cognition,” “a project that can be undertaken while leaving m uch of the cognitive psychology of m em ory as the study of processes that take place, essentially w ithout exception, w ithin nervous systems” (Adams and Aizawa, 2008:179). In contrast, my hunch is that an initial levelling of the grounds of inquiry can fruitfully and substantially rejig the terrain of m em ory studies by flattening out w hat otherw ise often rem ain the dam agingly discon­ nected domains of distinct disciplines. We w ant to examine relations betw een different m em ory-related phenom ena empirically, as the focus for explicit study (Wertsch, 2002: 37-38), rather than starting with any assumed divisions of proprietary labors between psychological and social sciences. So there is strategic room in m em ory studies for deterritorializing , refusing to privilege any particular location—w hether in neuro­ biology or in narrative, in cognition or culture—as the single hom e of our subject-matter. This m ight help in developing models of the rela­ tions between individual and collective m em ory based not on analogy or parallel or m etaphor, b u t on understanding interactions betw een distinct yet highly interdependent phenom ena. These interactions between forms of m emory and between disparate com ponents in and across (transient or enduring) systems take m any shapes, revealing cooperation and com plem entarity as well as com petition and conflict. The pluralist fram ew ork sketched in this paper for studying such forms of interaction and coordination has m any historical predecessors and contem porary resonances across the disciplines th at will not be highlighted here (see also Sutton, 2009). Instead, the paper selectively updates recent literature in the philosophy and psychology of m em oiy and distributed cognition, com plem enting a distinct treatm ent of related m aterial from a m ore em pirical perspective (Barnier, Sutton, Harris, and Wilson, 2008). Before em barking on the task of fram ework construction, here are two examples from recent empirical studies that do justice to the entangling of embodied, cognitive, affective, and cultural dimensions of remem bering. Neither is yet a case of “collective m em oiy”; before 24 social research seeking conceptual space for one way of characterizing such a notion, it will help first to delineate a broader range of m emory phenomena.

It contributes to the identification and recognition of food or food products, to their appreciation (pleasant/unpleasant), to the associated pleasure/displeasure and desire to eat, and therefore to the evaluation of their qualities (freshness, healthy character, caloric level, etc.). The sense of smell is also involved in overall perception – in particular, by aromas developed in the mouth that activate olfactory receptors through the retro-nasal pathway – and in other functions such as sensory-specific satiety. However, one of the most enigmatic properties of the sense of smell is undoubtedly the variation of its sensitivity according to our state of hunger or satiety. Obviously, smell is not the only sensory modality involved in food intake. In a state of satiety, sensitivity to bitterness was better than in a state of hunger.",

      "title": "Freezing displayed by others is a learned cue of danger resulting from co-experiencing own-freezing and shock",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Social cues of threat are widely reported [1–3], whether actively produced to trigger responses in others, such as the emission of alarm calls, or by-products of an encounter with a predator, like the defensive behaviors themselves, such as an escape flight [4–14]. Although the recognition of social alarm cues is often innate [15–17], in some instances it requires experience to trigger defensive responses [4,7]. One mechanism proposed for how learning from self-experience contributes to social behavior is that of auto-conditioning, whereby subjects learn to associate their own behaviors with the relevant trigger events. Through this process the same behaviors, now displayed by others, gain meaning. [18,19 but see: 20]. Although it has been shown that only animals with prior experience with shock display observational freezing [21–25] suggesting that auto-conditioning could mediate this process, evidence for this hypothesis was lacking. Previously we found that when a rat freezes, the silence that results from immobility triggers observational freezing in its cage-mate, provided the cage-mate had experienced shocks before [24]. Hence, in our study auto-conditioning would correspond to rats learning to associate shock with their own response to it – freezing. Using a combination of behavioral and optogenetic manipulations, here we show that freezing becomes an alarm cue by a direct association with shock. Our work shows that auto-conditioning can indeed modulate social interactions, expanding the repertoire of cues that mediate social information exchange, providing a framework to study how the neural circuits involved in the self-experience of defensive behaviors overlap with the ones involved in socially triggered defensive behaviors.",

In order to do so, we draw on the PEOPLE ARE ANIMALS metaphor, which was first put forward by Lakoff & Johnson in 1980. More specifically, we at analyzing three different types of animal expressions, namely: (i) those that are based either on prototypical actions performed by animals (e.g. to leave with one's tails between one's legs) or on animal parts (e.g. to have hawk's eyes); (ii) those that derive from animal names and which originate actions that can be applied to people's behavior (Bad luck seems to have dogged me throughout my whole life, I called out to him but he hared off in the opposite direction); and (iii) those that stem from sounds which are typically emitted by animals and can be used to refer to speech verbs (bark, bellow, howl, snarl, roar). With this purpose in mind, we elaborate on some of the ideas in Ruiz de Mendoza & Diez (2002) where it is argued that conceptual interaction is fully regulated and constrained by a limited set of interactional patterns; and we analyzed certain speech verb that are liable to be analyzed on the basis of conceptual metaphor theory.",

      "title": "Evolutionary Social Psychology",
      "abstract": "What a pity it would have been if biologists had refused to accept Darwin's theory of natural selection, which has been essential in helping biologists understand a wide range of phenomena in many animal species. These days, to study any animal species while refusing to consider the evolved adaptive significance of their behavior would be considered pure folly--unless, of course, the species is homo sapiens. Graduate students training to study this particular primate species may never take a single course in evolutionary theory, although they may take two undergraduate and up to four graduate courses in statistics. These methodologically sophisticated students then embark on a career studying human aggression, cooperation, mating behavior, family relationships, or altruism with little or no understanding of the general evolutionary forces and principles that shaped the behaviors they are investigating. This book hopes to redress that wrong. It is one of the first to apply evolutionary theories to mainstream problems in personality and social psychology that are relevant to a wide range of important social phenomena, many of which have been shaped and molded by natural selection during the course of human evolution. These phenomena include selective biases that people have concerning how and why a variety of activities occur. For example: * information exchanged during social encounters is initially perceived and interpreted; * people are romantically attracted to some potential mates but not others; * people often guard, protect, and work hard at maintaining their closest relationships; * people form shifting and highly complicated coalitions with kin and close friends; and * people terminate close, long-standing relationships. Evolutionary Social Psychology begins to disentangle the complex, interwoven patterns of interaction that define our social lives and relationships.",

Their presence is haphazard; between their own illicit movement and the ongoing attempts to exclude them from public space and public life, they float in and out of social experience more than they inhabit it. Constructed as threats to social order and public decency, they return to haunt the lives of the more secure. To understand the ghostly dynamics of such people and groups, criminologists need methods attuned to uncertainty and absence—methods designed to engage with the presence of absence, and to distinguish between those not there, those no longer there, and those soon to disappear. Such methods must also orient criminologists to ghostly spaces: to temporal aftermaths, to residues and ruins, and to the interstitial shadows of social life. To embrace such methods, though, is not only to seek ghosts; it is to reject positivist methods and their mythologies of certainty, factuality, and predictability.",

Although acting was sometimes used, the performers in Happenings generally tended to “be” nobody or nothing other than themselves; nor did they represent, or pretend to be in, a time or place different than that of the spectator. They walked, ran, said words, sang, washed dishes, swept, operated machines and stage devices, and so forth, but they did not feign or impersonate. In most cases, acting and not-acting are relatively easy to recognize and identify. In a performance, we usually know when a person is acting and when he is not. But there is a scale or continuum of behavior involved, and the differences between acting and not-acting may be quite small. In such cases categorization may not be easy. Perhaps some would say it is unimportant, but, in fact, it is precisely these borderline cases that can provide insights into acting theory and into the nature of the art.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTGratitude is a prototypical emotional response when life's blessings come from the intentional goodwill of other people, but many also attribute good experiences to the intervention of God, gods, a Higher Power, or other benevolent spiritual forces. This study investigated the differences between how United States participants (N = 610) experience interpersonal gratitude and spiritual gratitude. Compared to interpersonal gratitude, spiritual gratitude experiences were less often attributed to human action, more often attributed to supernatural beings and circumstances beyond human control, and elicited significantly less feelings of gratitude, indebtedness, and admiration, but greater awe. Participants reported the highest feelings of gratitude when they also believed in a personal God with a benevolent mind. These findings demonstrate the importance of perceiving benevolent agency in evoking feelings of gratitude, whereas experiences that are attributed to more abstract, less personified, or less external entities elicit a different profile of positive emotional responses.KEYWORDS: Godspiritualitygratitudeexternal attributions Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Supplementary materialSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2023.2239781Data availabilityAll data and analysis code for this article is available at https://osf.io/5dyhg/Open scholarship This article has earned the Center for Open Science badges for Open Data, Open Materials and Preregistered.

      "title": "Visibility in Architecture Extended through Audiovisual Communication Technologies",
      "abstract": "Audiovisual communication media that are embedded in physical architecture can extend buildings by integrating spaces that are non-adjacent. A large variety of technologies has been developed and subsequently evaluated in this context, such as video conferencing, media spaces and audiovisual technologies embedded in collaborative virtual environments. The resulting extended spatial topologies are designed to increase organisational flexibility, improve team cohesion and to reduce the need for business travel, a concern particularly relevant today. Two effects of this are of interest in the context here. Firstly, when these technologies are always-on as well as widely accessible, and therefore permit spontaneous social interaction, studies have shown how the connected spaces can become an integral part of social life and the existing work processes of a given organisation. Secondly, movement in the connected virtual or remote physical environments can make our bodies appear to be extended through electronic sense organs. In other words, while not being able to physically enter these spaces, we can perceive them with a subset of our perception: in the cases discussed here vision and hearing. Related to both the above, there is good evidence that brain, body and environment cannot be considered separately in our understanding of how we perceive the world, an argument that has been picked up to explain some of the phenomena found in spatial analysis conducted through Space Syntax techniques. Given the background of technological extensions to our environments and to our bodies, it then becomes necessary to re-evaluate our understanding of movement through architectural environments. This paper begins this process by focussing on one particular issue: visibility in audiovisually extended architectural environments as it is affected by camera technologies. For this purpose, key camera properties are being considered before an overview of ‘spatial technological isovists’ is presented. This is used to discuss the effects on visibility, access to space and permeability as well as the apparent shape of audiovisually extended architectural configurations. 1. Technology extensions to environment and body A wide variety of audiovisual communication media have been developed and deployed to overcome the limitations of physical spatial layouts. With the aim to improve organisational flexibility and to allow geographically distributed workplaces, including outsourcing activities and tele-working, organisation are making use of these technologies in the boardroom, ordinary offices and on the desktop. This results in hybrid audiovisually extended spatial environments that consist of a mixture of physical and electronic places of different types and geometries, ‘held together’ by a variety of technologies.",

      "title": "A Lived Body Affected by Motor Disability",
      "abstract": "This article applies the body phenomenology perspective of M. Merleau-Ponty to explore how people with motor disability experience the lived world through their disabled bodies, and in what senses their relationship with the world – as well as with their body, which is also a part of the world – is coloured. Their personal narratives are based on qualitative in-depth interviews and suggest that disabilities acquired by people at later stages of their lives are experienced as certain disobediences of the body, i.e., the discrepancy between the intentions to move and the movement itself. The loss of tactile sensations in the separate parts of the body complicates the subject’s relationship with the world because, in the case of the non-sensitive areas of body, the contact with the world is indirect, i.e., created through some other part of the body as an intermediary. The individuals who possess a congenital disability or that have acquired it in childhood do not give any prominence to the disfunctionality of their body or to the limited capacity of movement and do not focus on the disability as a certain problem or a hindrance to their existence in the world; it is so because ever since their early age they are in constant contact with the world through the body affected by the disability. On the other hand, for them a physical disability is actualised in their interactions with other non-disabled corporeal subjects as well as in confrontations with the physical objects occurring in their liv­ing environments, which, due to their own disability, they are unavailable to dispose of.",

      "title": "The evolution of communication",
      "abstract": "Communication is a fundamentally interactive phenomenon. Evolutionary biology recognises this fact in its definition of communication, in which signals are those actions that cause reactions, and where both action and reaction are designed for that reason. Where only one or the other is designed then the behaviours are classed as either cues or coercion. Since mutually dependent behaviours are unlikely to emerge simultaneously, the symmetry inherent in these definitions gives rise to a prediction that communication will only emerge if cues or coercive behaviours do so first. They will then be co-opted for communication. A range of case studies, from animal signalling, evolutionary robotics, comparative psychology, and evolutionary linguistics are used to test this prediction. The first three are found to be supportive. However in the Embodied Communication Game, a recent experimental approach to the emergence of communication between adult humans, communication emerges even when cues or coerced behaviours are not possible. This suggests that humans are exceptional in this regard. It is argued that the reason for this is the degree to which we are able and compelled to read and interpret the behaviour of others in intentional terms.",

In others, cognition is associated with a verb of auditory perception, touch, or smell. 'Vision' is not the universally preferred means of perception. In numerous cultures, taboos are associated with forbidden visual experience. Vision may be considered intrusive and aggressive, and linked with power. In contrast, 'hearing' and 'listening'.",

      "abstract": "This chapter extends my examination of Cicely Saunders’s repeated assertion that words are rarely needed in end-of-life care. Starting from Saunders’s interest in the power of her patients’ passivity, I argue ‘total pain’ incorporates how the dying body’s vulnerability establishes new forms of relationality and temporality so that personhood lies increasingly in relations with others and experiences frequently feel timeless. Modes of caring presence expressed through non-narrative acts like touch, watching and ‘being with’, which Saunders implies assist with ‘total pain’, can be understood as ways of holding or making space for the complexities of such experience, while accepting potential shortfalls in communication or understanding. Saunders is therefore not only an early advocate for forms of narrative medicine but also of non-instrumental acts that challenge positivist medical interventions by seeming to do nothing but nevertheless affirming value through bearing witness.",

However, can animals reason from abstractions, concepts, and unobservable forces? Primates can extract general rules from observed or experienced associations. In the physical domain, they can reason about missing elements, plan ahead for future needs, and may even consider the role of causal agents. In the social domain, they also categorize relationships, deceive competitors, and know what others see or intend to do. One of the limits that can be detected in both the physical and social domains, however, is the lack of capacity to call upon unobservable forces such as gravity, solidity, or belief of others to explain their world.",

Both those who judge some particular person to be courageous or generous or just or whatever (using those words in accordance with commonplace usage) and those who apparently judge similarly (using those very same words, but doing so in order to give expression to their own particular systematic and coherent understanding of the virtues) will of course do so on the basis of some set of actions by that person. And it may well be the case, indeed it often enough is the case, that it is on the basis of the very same set of actions, performed in some limited set of situations, that both parties judge that particular person courageous or generous or just. Because he or she on a limited, but sufficiently numerous, range of occasions has done particular brave or generous or just actions and has not performed any clearly cowardly or niggardly or unjust actions, a settled disposition so to act is ascribed. But what it is crucial to notice is that although both parties are ascribing a disposition, using the same words to do so, it is not the same disposition that is being ascribed. The same sentences are being employed, but the judgements to which they give expression are in fact different. Wherein does the difference lie?",

A common observation in and about Alltown is that in the past 'cousins married cousins', and that 'original Alltown families' were all related to each other. Similar ideas of interrelatedness are deployed in descriptions of present-day Alltown and are used to portray either its 'parochial' or its 'friendly' nature.

      "abstract": "The lexeme Erscheinung/Erscheinen (manifestation) is related to the formative process of Werden (becoming) that fascinated Goethe throughout his life and which, in turn, is part and parcel of his understanding of morphology in all its manifestations, from the most elementary chemical processes to the highest products of the human mind. Because he was convinced that every existent thing necessitates interpretation to be grasped in its changefulness, he employed a range of surrogates to express the meanings of Erscheinung/Erscheinen. Thus, the lexeme can be translated in different ways: foremost as manifestation, phenomenon, appearance, or illusion. Moreover, Goethe believed that each manifestation is the result of an unrecognized law in the appearing object that corresponds to an unknown regulating principle in the observing subject and that nothing in living nature is static or occurs in isolation; everything is interconnected. Thus, Goethe’s method of inquiry consisted of close empirical observation that included reflection on the observing subjects themselves—a form of phenomenology. Consequently, Anschauen and Gegenstand also enter into the semantic field. Finally, the following examination highlights a lesser-known signification of Erscheinung in Goethe’s usage, one for which he did not have a specific term: that of emergence. Emergence seems most apt to express Goethe’s “lebendiger Begriff” (living concept), which can be seen as the counterpart to nature’s “lebendiges Fließen” (living flow), which he repeatedly expressed in his literary and scientific writing.",

      "title": "Hybrid Incentives: Carrots, Sticks, or Carrots Which Become Sticks?",
      "abstract": "Various incentives may be used in order to cause a person to desist from an activity that creates negative externalities. It is possible, naturally, to use a stick and to apply an economic sanction in order to incentivize them to desist from that activity. It is also possible to use a carrot, i.e., to grant them a financial prize if they desist from the activity. Each of these incentives has advantages and disadvantages. Literature and practice are familiar with various combinations of sticks and carrots. In most cases, the mechanism is “horizontal”, e.g. using carrots with respect to certain parts of the population, and sticks against other parts. The Article presents a novel, vertical, sequential mechanism, in the form of a “game” played in two consecutive stages that are connected to each other, that trap the person who perpetrated a negative action within the mechanism, with no possible way out. At the center of the first stage of the vertical mechanism stands a carrot – a reward or a positive incentive – which is combined with a certain social sanction (shaming). At the center of the second stage, which is activated only if the implementation of the first stage did not meet with success, stands a stick – a punishment or a negative incentive. The objective will be to incentivize a person to engage in fruitful negotiations to end the harmful activity at the pre-mechanism stage, for after the mechanism begins operating and as more time passes, he will only lose. For this purpose, an illustration will be offered of the negative social behavior of one-sided refusal to give or accept the Jewish divorce bill in the Jewish sector the world over, in a reality in which it is not possible under religious law to compel a refuser to give or accept that bill, namely, the intractable agunah problem. The mechanism will be built primarily on the basis of a few theories from the field of law and economics: reversible rewards, dual-chooser rules, and modular liability rules. The main argument will be that the use of a multi-part vertical incentives mechanism increases efficiency at minimal additional cost; it overcomes a moral problem of “rewarding the sinner” by giving him a carrot and combines in optimal fashion the advantages entailed by activating the sticks and the carrots, and at the same time – insofar as possible – nullifies most of the disadvantages of each of them.",

Unlike the color of a car or the loudness of a piece of music, both of which can be more or less directly perceived by the respective sensory systems, the trustworthiness of a person or the aggressiveness of a social exchange can only be inferred or construed from various indirect cues. People have to go beyond the information given in order to arrive at a social judgment. In this sense, social perception is an active and constructive process of the perceiver. Not surprisingly, then, the same social situation or the same person may be “perceived” quite differently by different perceivers, or by the same perceiver in different situational contexts.",

      "abstract": "This exploration into social meanings packs along with it an assumption that social studies have yet to arrive at any ‘moment’ of potential in which they can confidently set about describing human behaviour in a way that makes the topic analytically familiar, and therefore warrants the analysis. Indeed, I take it for now that people’s actions are new and strange. There is a small band of the ‘self-disciplined’ who view the social landscapes around them with fresh eyes; the occasional philosopher, some of the historians, ethnomethodologists, and conversation analysts, plus a few of the anthropologists and ethnographers. But they are exceptions. The problem appears to be this: Because everyone, analyst and lay person, is a committed expert on social behaviour, very few have felt the need to attempt an agreement on the details; for example, the profoundly-social properties of the very language we all use to describe it. Practitioners of natural science are not simply observing reality but displaying also their astonishment, frustrations, equivocations, justifications, agreements, criticisms, occasional relief, and other tokens of it. If the early astronomers and chemists had an advantage, it was the lack of experts bending their ears.\r\n\r\nAccumulating empirical descriptions of social events will not necessarily result in a progressive discipline, only the potential for a workable philosophy that leaves the landscape unchanged. After that, who knows? But the potential offers more towards a warrant than what currently stands as social science. In the following chapters, the reader will find descriptions of social objects that appear in a court of law, and in settings that involve what we like to gloss as humour, laughter, and play. The analytic logic of these descriptions stands before the action and knows how to do it (such logic is not a reference to something hidden behind or within). This type of understanding features in a growing canon of studies towards which the following project aspires.",

Data was also obtained on the frequency of alt use, motivations for constructing alts, and the main forms of identity experimentation engaged in with alts. The combined results were then used to construct a model of how personality systems composed of multiple offline and online identities operate and form a \"multiple personality order.\" As 3D virtual worlds and the global population of avatars continue to grow, creating and coordinating a system of multiple offline and online identities will increasingly become a normative feature of human development and, like a choreographer managing a company of dancers or a conductor leading an orchestra, the operation of personality will take on a quality of performance art.",

Here, we explore this question with a special focus on both core, to a large extent biologically rooted (e.g., personality, intelligence), and surface, more malleable and socio-culturally conditioned (e.g., creative self-concept), predictors of real-life creativity. Using a series of multivariate structural equation models (N = 803), we examined how creative self-concept, lower-level personality aspects, and cognitive ability (divergent thinking and intelligence) relate to creative activities and achievements across domains. Creative activity in certain domains (i.e., science or art) fully mediated the links between creative self-concept, intelligence, divergent thinking, personality, and creative achievement. No cross-domain effects were observed; while creative activity in art predicted achievement in art, it did not predict science accomplishment. Similarly, the activity in science predicted achievement in science, but not in the arts. The structure of the most relevant predictors of creative activity across domains differed. Creative activity in science was mainly predicted by intelligence, divergent thinking and the Intellect aspect of the Openness to Experience trait. Creative activity in art was predicted by the Openness aspect of the Openness to Experience personality trait and creative self-concept. For everyday creative activity, intelligence, personality, and creative self-concept played a more balanced and similar role. We discuss the implications of these findings and propose directions for future research.",

      "title": "The Role of Plans for Qua-Events and Their Effects on Part-Structure",
      "abstract": "Davidsonian event semantics has become immensely influential in contemporary natural language semantics. On that view, all events (including acts and states) are considered the same ontologically, i.e., Davidsonian particulars, and they all serve as arguments of verbs and corresponding nominalizations. We argue that that view has to be rejected both ontologically and on the level of compositional semantics. We argue that natural language reflects two related ontological distinctions: first a distinction between base events (BE) and plan events (PE) (which are based on plans or procedures); second a distinction between acts and intentional acts. We propose an ontological account of PEs and intentional acts based on Fine’s notion of a qua object: a PE is a BE qua realizing a plan and an intentional act is an act qua realizing an intention. The BE-PE distinction manifests itself in existence predicates for events and predicates of participation (take part in, participate, be part of). Unlike Fine, we allow properties of qua events to be inherited not only from their base (temporal part structure), but also from their gloss, namely as a ‘slot mereology’ consisting of plan-specific roles, which can be specified for particular individuals or be open. Whereas the ordinary noun part (as in the parts of) picks out parts of the former part structure, the light noun part in the predicates take part in and be part of picks out roles inherited from the plan. Whereas take part in can relate to both specified and open roles, be part of can only target specified roles. The distinction between BEs and PEs is encoded in lexical semantics only; the distinction between acts and intentional acts is also encoded in syntax, in the presence of a silent operator. This requires a more complex form of event semantics than standard Davidsonian semantics.",

      "abstract": "Cooperation poses theoretical problems because the behaviors of individuals can benefit others. Evolutionary and game-theory explanations that focus on maximizing one's own material outcomes are usually supported by experimental models with isolated and anonymous subjects. Cooperation in the natural world, however, is often a social act whereby familiar individuals coordinate behaviors for shared outcomes. Social cooperation is also associated with a cooperation bias expressed as a preference for cooperation even when noncooperation is immediately more beneficial. The authors report on evidence for such a bias in a captive group of bottlenose dolphins that voluntarily preferred to receive petting from human guides by using a pairwise coordinated approach, even though this was more difficult, and total petting amount was thereby reduced. To explain why this bias occurs, the authors propose an integrated behavioral-evolutionary approach whereby performance is determined by two kinds of immediate outcomes: material gains and intrinsic affective states associated with cooperating. The latter can provide reinforcement when immediate material gains are reduced, delayed, or absent. Over a lifetime, this proximate mechanism can lead to cooperative relationships whose long-term ultimate consequences can be adaptive.",

      "abstract": "Friendships between humans and non-human animals were once dismissed as sentimental anthropomorphism. After decades of research on the emotional and cognitive capacities of animals, we now recognize human&ndash;animal friendships as true reciprocal relationships. Friendships with animals have many of the same characteristics as friendships between humans. Both parties enjoy the shared presence that friendship entails along with the pleasures that come with knowing another being. Both friends develop ways of communicating apart from, or in addition to, spoken language. Having an animal as a best friend can take the form of relationship known as the &ldquo;pet&rdquo;, but it can also take other forms. People who work with animals often characterize their non-human partners as friends. People who work with search-and-rescue dogs, herding dogs, or police dogs develop and depend on the closeness of friendship. The same holds for equestrians, as horses and riders must understand each other&rsquo;s bodies and movements intimately. In some situations, animals provide the sole source of affection and interaction in people&rsquo;s lives. Homeless people who live on the streets with animal companions experience togetherness 24/7. This book explores the various forms these friendships take. It sheds light on what these friendships mean and how they expand the interdisciplinary knowledge of the roles of animals in society.",

In order to adapt effectively, organizations require resources, capabilities at using them, knowledge about the worlds in which they exist, good fortune, and good decisions. They typically face competition for resources and uncertainties about the future. Many, but possibly not all, of the factors determining their fates are outside their control. Populations of organizations and individual organizations survive, in part, presumably because they possess adaptive intelligence; but survival is by no means assured. The second component of intelligence involves the elegance of interpretations of the experiences of life. Such interpretations encompass both theories of history and philosophies of meaning, but they go beyond such things to comprehend the grubby details of daily existence. Interpretations decorate human existence. They make a claim to significance that is independent of their contribution to effective action. Such intelligence glories in the contemplation, comprehension, and appreciation of life, not just the control of it.-from The Ambiguities of Experience In The Ambiguities of James G. March asks a deceptively simple question: What is, or should be, the role of experience in creating intelligence, particularly in organizations? Folk wisdom both trumpets the significance of experience and warns of its inadequacies. On one hand, experience is described as the best On the other hand, experience is described as the teacher of fools, of those unable or unwilling to learn from accumulated knowledge or the teaching of experts. The disagreement between those folk aphorisms reflects profound questions about the human pursuit of intelligence through learning from experience that have long confronted philosophers and social scientists. This book considers the unexpected problems organizations (and the individuals in them) face when they rely on experience to adapt, improve, and survive. While acknowledging the power of learning from experience and the extensive use of experience as a basis for adaptation and for constructing stories and models of history, this book examines the problems with such learning. March argues that although individuals and organizations are eager to derive intelligence from experience, the inferences stemming from that eagerness are often misguided. The problems lie partly in errors in how people think, but even more so in properties of experience that confound learning from it. Experience, March concludes, may possibly be the best teacher, but it is not a particularly good teacher.",

      "title": "To Know or Not to Know: Consciousness, Meta-consciousness, and Motivation",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is invariably a slippery construct, but especially so when it comes to considering its relationship to motivation. To take an everyday example, consider the case of scratching an insect bite. When bitten by a mosquito, one knows that scratching will ultimately just increase the itching. Sometimes one simply gives in to the urge and deliberately scratches the darn thing, knowing full well the subsequent price that will be paid. In this case, it is clear that the motivation to scratch was fully conscious. But what about the case in which one suddenly catches oneself scratching the forbidden itch? There is this moment of realization to the effect, “Ahh, that feels good, but oh, I didn't want to do that.” In one sense, such actions lack conscious awareness, as the action that one is engaged in is precisely counter to one's goals. Moreover, there is the sense in which one has “caught” oneself “absentmindedly” engaging in the forbidden behavior. In another sense, however, the action and its concomitant motivation are conscious. That is, after one catches oneself, there is an appreciation of the pleasure that the scratching afforded as it temporarily relieved the itch. In short, when one catches oneself scratching an itch, there is a distinct sense that both the motivation to scratch (the itch) and the action itself (scratching) have been consciously experienced.",

      "title": "Re-evoking absent people: what languaging implies for radical embodiment",
      "abstract": "Re-evoking examines how languaging enacts human social intelligence. Turning from linguistic tradition, we reduce language to neither abstracta nor form. Rather, as human activity, languaging enables people to co-act as they direct attention within what Margolis (2010b; 2016) calls an enlanguaged world. Given their embodiment, people use languaging to evoke absent others in a flow of action, feeling, judgment, and attitudes. Although based on organism-environment coupling, languaging is also activity that re-evokes the absent. In an enlanguaged world, people use emplaced activity as part of practices, events, situations, artifacts, and so on. Hence, people reach beyond the body as they re-evoke the absent by languaging or, by definition, \"activity in which wordings play a part.\"As we suggest, absent people are evoked by othering. In common domains (e.g. a school), social habits give rise to dispositions during a history of co-acting that, later, can re-evoke absent others and past selves. Having begun with a literary example, we later turn to a detailed case study to show how a narrator brings feeling to languaging (in this case, frustration) as she re-evokes other people as they are for her. In conclusion, we suggest that radical embodiment needs to be extended to include how human practices link coupling with social intelligence as people channel what they do with the help of languaging.",

Despite this state of affairs, not everyone will experience a sense of aloneness, especially if other people are imagined or if the person has no desire to be with them at that moment. Similarly, a person may be surrounded by other people and still experience an uncomfortable sense of being alone, particularly if he or she feels excluded from participating with them in a meaningful way.

      "abstract": "The world of things in the information society breaks the established boundaries of its everyday existence and perception, exposing itself in a variety of forms, interconnections and articulations of bodily transformations. This process allows us to see behind the usual material background of everyday artifacts the endless social drama in the battle of human being for the acculturation and domestication of nature. A thing as an object of culture appears in a variety of guises – as a character, event, sign, symbol and narrative, but each time joining in the conversation about the urgent and life-and-death in the incessant dialogue of human being with his creation. Despite the seeming material autonomy, burden and inviolability of the objective world – things are not at all indifferent to the experiences, preferences and values of individual. In one case, they bind their creator to themselves or even enslave him, imprisoning a person in the walls built around him, in another – they protect and save from the onslaught of external forces, providing people with the necessary means to tame the elements, arrange the world and promote their aspirations, ambitions and plans. In this article, the objective world of culture is considered through its coupling with creative practices and innovations decisions. Cultural artifacts objectively mark the social world, which allows us to consider them as a kind of warning signs of distinction and memorable marks. Things attract people, just as people attract them to themselves in the implementation of their needs and plans. Things acquire their communicative properties in a cultural context that sets and forms the social significance of an artifact, making it an economically useful, aesthetically attractive and recognizable object. Creativity of action turns a thing into an accomplice and designer of a new cultural reality, which the author tries to show in her article.",

      "abstract": "Emotions are what make us human and emotions are what make us different. A person can make a list of such expressions about the role of human emotions, as they play a central role in our lives, in our interactions with others and the surrounding environment. Emotions are in a broad sense the regulators of our interaction with the world as they play a central role in our perception of the world and in our knowledge construction. In another angle, sensations are our immediate detector of the surrounding environment as, since ever, we see, touch and smell what is around us, we ear friendly voices or run from predator’s sounds and taste food that keep us alive. Both emotions and sensations can be used to describe our living and our main interactions with the world. However, despite that important role of senses and emotions, there is a poor representation of sensorial information and lack of understanding of emotions from the side of computational systems. Subsequently it is noticeable the absence of support to acquire and fully represent human sensorial experience and lack of ability to represent, and appropriately react, from those systems to emotional activity. The proposed work consists in developing a framework that acquires knowledge about human emotions from self-reporting or the interaction with Internet objects and media. In particular, it intends to facilitate their emotions description at the Internet from proposed samples of sensorial information allowing a later management of that knowledge for the most diverse objectives, as an example, for searching objects or media through similarities of emotional and sensorial patterns.",

Can an abstract thought be built from sensory experience – or would there rather be need for other ingredients to construct abstraction? These are questions that heated the debate in ancient Greece – (cf. Plato's and Aristotle's positions) – and are being warmed up in contemporary cognitive and brain science. Can we add anything new? We have a vast number of nice brain pictures to show – pictures that indicate brain parts active when people think, speak, listen, and understand. But a colored picture is not always easily converted into a thousand words, let alone a new insight. Here, the embodiment question will be addressed on the basis of new evidence from cognitive neuroscience in the hope that the brain pictures, especially the dynamic ones, might speak to the issues – or more modestly, might make a significant contribution to the cognitive debate.",

Roughly speaking, there are two reasons why the homeless sleep outside: (1) They are unwilling or unable to use homeless shelters, since shelter rules exclude rough sleepers. (2) Life outside attracts rough sleepers. A group of rough sleepers find their means of existence and part of their social network in the public space of the city. Part of the rough sleepers' preference for public space is due to the fact that they live in the nighttime and (try to) sleep in the daytime. To understand why homeless sleep outside -- I conclude -- it is necessary to look at the rough sleepers' overall logic, not just at one aspect of their life, like addiction or mental disturbance. 19 References.

Learning from punishment, including badmouth, is impossible in harsh environments, where agents do not survive rejections received. Imitation is indispensable, but what to imitate? Frequent behaviors are not necessarily socially desirable, neither fitness observable. In this paper, agents meeting infrequent but lethal food scarcity survive thanks to food sharing. Saving recipients from certain death, donations reduce altruists’ lifetime. Results show that prudent donors, helping only when above starvation point, are exploited by cheaters and soon extinguish. The same happens with agents taking reciprocity into account, and helping only when their credits are turned off. Instead, agents endowed with dynamic goals (survival vs. giving help) learn even the most unconditioned form of altruism, thus avoiding extinction. Tentative conclusions are discussed. Among others, dynamic goal-directed agents are autonomous entities learning even the most generous forms of altruism. Moreover, prudence is not necessarily more adaptive than unconditioned altruism; indeed, it may be self-defeating under given conditions.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. … the extraordinary propensity of the human being to join hands with external forces in an attack upon his own existence is one of the most remarkable of biological phenomena (Menninger 1938) The term 'superego’(which should perhaps be replaced by‘anti‐ego’) is used to denote a set of habitual response tendencies that are antagonistic to the self, and cause the subject to behave as if he were two separate persons at war with each other. The superego develops in early life and may be ‘punitive’or‘humiliating’or both. The former kind arises through learning to restrain the self from dangerously rebelling against overwhelming coercion, and the latter through intense striving to avoid parental scorn. The resultant‘internal’conflict resembles the external one between an actual child and a demanding parent; and the relative fortunes of the two antagonists provide a model for understanding the characteristics of many kinds of emotional and psychosomatic disorder. Superego behaviour is propagated from generation to generation; and perpetuates itself in the individual by preventing the responses that, by proving it unnecessary, would lead to its extinction. Self‐punitive conditions are therefore highly resistant to treatment, which must be specially directed to the particular needs of each of the patient's two conflicting parts in turn. To be able to do this, psychotherapists themselves need to be freed from their own internal conflicts during training and later.",

      "title": "Adaptive Behavior and Consciousness",
      "abstract": "Consciousness has resisted scientific explanation for centuries. The main problem in explaining consciousness is accounting for its subjectivity. Subjectivity is an internal point of view or perspective (context) developed from current sensory input and previous experience (perception). Subjective systems may be adaptive; that is, able to respond to change. Humans have the ability to produce voluntary new or novel intentional (adaptive) action and such production is very important for survival. This action is always composed through the choice or free will of the person (voluntary), is always new or novel, and is always directed towards some goal (intentional). Adaptive action is always composed according to the subject‘s point of view or perspective at the moment and is always accompanied by consciousness. Hence the two may be the same. Adaptive action normally arises from perception. Perception directly produces basic programmed action. In order to produce adaptive action, perception must be represented in a new way, so that it becomes explicit, functional, and conscious. This new representation may be accomplished through operation of a positive feedback nonlinear emergent mechanism which is responsible for the generation of a large number of natural phenomena. This mechanism results in the production of explicit stable states from perception which has all the same properties as consciousness and hence may be identical to consciousness. These states are a type of active short term memory and have the ability to produce various types of adaptive action. Consciousness is shown to be natural, material, and functional; utilized in the production of adaptive action.",

The study of social status requires a longitudinal study, inasmuch as a status hierarchy implies long-term relationships between the animals rather than a transitory one decided at the time of each interaction. Captive groups allow for detailed analysis of many hypotheses generated as a result of field studies and experiments. Certain types of field experiments may also be performed in the natural habitat, and some problems involving long-term kinship can be studied either in the natural habitat or using specially maintained captive groups.",

      "title": "Geographies of Pragmatism",
      "abstract": "Pragmatism is a philosophy that sees life as being defined by the relations of organisms and things in an environment that is ever changing and uncertain. The nature of these relationships (or transactions, as pragmatists call them) is such that they are persistently co-constitutive, with no rounded-out clearly defined objects or organisms. This relational, processual view of life embeds human organisms in an active environment such that their knowledge of it is primarily acquired through action, in situations, and is only provisional and not based on solid foundations. Situations are contextual, though not necessarily geographically and spatially so. Acquiring robust knowledge to operate in this environment involves persistent experimentation and the testing out of ideas through active intervention in the world. Active experimentation comes about when the habitual relations of organisms to their environment become obstructed or uncertain (in problematic situations), otherwise most organic activity (including that of humans) is noncognitive and based on habit that is embodied and involving affect. Humans’ problem-solving capacities have been expanded by language use, and thus communication takes on an important role as a collective problem-solving capacity (or mind), a type of rationality that exists beyond individual cognitive capacities. The effective functioning of these capacities is the pragmatist’s idea of democratic life. This normative aspiration acts as a critique of actually existing democratic systems, with all their institutional anachronisms, social divisions, and obstacles to the realization of individual and thus collective capacities. Pragmatism emerged in the United States in the second half of the 19th century, involving figures such as William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, George Herbert Mead, and John Dewey. It was a philosophy strongly influenced by Darwinian naturalism but also by the traumatic experience of civil war. From both these influences pragmatism has taken an assumption of the ineluctable nature of relations all things but also of the dangers of beliefs that separate or deny this interrelatedness. Despite its environmental sensibilities (and some early connections via urban sociology) there have been no consistent relations between geographical thinking and pragmatism. But as an antifoundational and process philosophy of material things and organisms pragmatism has stimulated a flurry of recent engagement through variants of poststructuralist thinking that have involved geographical enquiry and critique.",

      "abstract": "Summary (1)Four varieties of primitive affect are distinguishable, characterised by (a) strain, and (b) relaxation in response to a favourable situation, and by (c) strain, and (d) relaxation in response to one unfavourable. Exhilaration, gladness and interest arise from (a); ease, bliss and contentment from (b); uneasiness, distress and repugnance from (c), depression, sadness and apathy from (d). (2)These affects are due to (i) the organic harmony or discord induced by the environment; wherewith are evoked (ii) innately purposive patterns of out-going locomotor and organic activity, partly self-controlled and producing organic sensations; the latter again induce (iii) organic harmony or discord. Self-activity is “affected” by (i), (ii) and (iii). An innate basis is afforded by (i) and (ii) for the affect, which is completely developed by (iii) derived from actual expression. (3)Instincts are integrated from different higher and lower reflexes, emotions from different instincts, sentiments from different emotions organized within progressively higher systems and subjected to control and inhibition, which are important determinants of the accompanying feeling. In the lowest reflexes the self is “affected” only by (iii). The higher reflexes are accompanied by the affects evoked as described above in (2). Instincts, emotions and sentiments are accom panied by their special feelings depending on the integration of dispositions to lower feelings and on (ii) and (iii).",

      "abstract": "Expressive behaviour can be considered a subset of behaviour in general for an embodied agent, whether this is a living human, a robot or a graphically embodied synthetic character. We can think of it as that behaviour interpreted by others as directly signalling an affective state. It may be a distinctly produced behaviour, as in facial expression or gesture, but it may also be a behavioural modifier as in posture or tone of voice. Because in principle it tells the observer something about the internal state of the agent, it acts as an additional communication mechanism alongside more externally directed and functional behaviour, whether physical actions or the use of natural language. Indeed it is argued that in the case of humans, around 80% of overall communication comes through these indirect channels (Argyle, 1972).",

      "title": "A World Without Pretense? Honest and Dishonest Signaling in Social Life",
      "abstract": "Writings on the Philosophy of Psychology asks: \"Could one imagine a world in which there could be no pretence?\"Again he asks: \"Can one imagine people who cannot lie? -What else would these people lack?,\" and answers: \"We should probably also imagine that they cannot make anything up and do not understand things that are made up.\" 2 The authors whose writings I plan to discuss do not go so far as to envision a world in which the capacity to pretend or simulate is entirely lacking.But in what might be viewed as a compensatory response to the seeming pervasiveness of lying, fraud, and deception in our daily lives, many emotion theorists are committed to the idea that the problem of cheating and dissimulation can be alleviated, if not completely eliminated, because there exist inbuilt mechanisms of reliable or truthful signaling.They adopt the view that honesty, or knowing whom to trust, is guaranteed in advance, as it were, because difficult or impossibleto-fake facial movements and other non-verbal signals have evolved through natural selection to provide accurate information about a person's internal, affective states.We might put it that such emotion theorists believe they have found a solution to the philosophical problem of other minds by appealing to the idea of innately determined emotional \"expressions\" that, under the right conditions, unfailingly signal to us what other people are thinking and feeling because those expressions are hardwired to do so.These same emotion theorists further believe, or proceed as if they believe, that without such a system of communication designed by natural selection to automatically vouchsafe the genuineness and sincerity of emotional signals, trust, cooperation, and indeed genuine altruism are doomed to be undermined by the selfish human tendency to cheat.They therefore propose that the evolution of reliable emotional signals helps answer the basic political question of how it is that unrelated human beings can come to trust and hence cooperate with each other in civic life.ROBERT FRANK AND THE BASIC EMOTION PARADIGM The literature on these topics is enormous.In my essay I want to focus on the claims that have been made about the nature of emotional signaling.One obvious place to begin is with Robert Frank's influential book, Passion Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions, published more than twenty years ago, in 1988.In that work the author, an economist who combines concerns with game theory and evolutionary psychology, set out to challenge the then commonly accepted view that people always act rationally, which is to say, selfishly, in pursuit of their own financial and other interests.In opposition to such a \"self-interest\" model of human action, Frank proposed a commitment model of behavior.According to Frank's commitment model, our passions predispose us to act \"irrationally.\"By this he meant that our emotions prompt us to act in ways that may be contrary to our own",

      "abstract": "This chapter describes the loose relationship between sex scenes in games and a three-act narrative structure, and how sex's place on the latter affects its impact on the player and the story. It breaks down the concept of rising and falling action or tension and describes the implications of sex in each phase of the story: Act 1 establishing setup, setting up the world and characters sex here establishes the character's relationships or personality before the story begins. Act 1 inciting incident, an event that kicks the action of the game into motion sex can be an inciting incident! Act 2 rising action, as the stakes and tension of the game grow higher sex becomes part of story and character development along the way. Act 2 before the climax, or Act 3 climax sex as a dramatic \"deep breath\" before the final plunge, or the final step of a developing relationship arc. Act 3 resolution sex as part of the \"happily ever after.\" Outside the three-act structure some games and/or sex scenes aren't attached to a central narrative and may take place separately (e.g., open-world encounters). The chapter also stresses that if there is only one sex scene in a game, its place in the larger narrative structure takes on bigger story importance as The Big Sex Scene, while having multiple sex scenes can spread this out and ameliorate the effect. The chapter ends with questions on applying this structure to existing games or the reader's projects.",

One speaks of atmospheres continuously, describes them and calls them into question every time that some invisible effects seem to be out of proportion with respect to their visible causes and not fully perceivable through standard sense organs. This ontological contrast between Gernot Bohme's and Hermann Schmitz's accounts also refers to a different assessment of everyday life's aestheticisation: It is stigmatised by Schmitz as a misleading propaganda, while it is analysed by Bohme as the unavoidable reflection of a more general \"theatricalization of our life\". The relationship between the perceiver and the already mentioned three types of atmospheres may result in many different emotional interactions. In order to legitimately speak of atmospheric feelings rather than generically of emotions and feelings, one must refer to feelings that are poured out into a certain space and that one experiences as coming from the environment, thus overturning culture's dominant introjectionism.",

This paper documents beliefs in a \"contact-free\" form of contagion whereby an object is thought to inherit the essence of a person when it was designed, but never actually physically touched, by the individual. We refer to this phenomenon as contagion through creative intent or “intention-based contagion” and distinguish it from more traditional forms of contact-based contagion (Studies 1 and 2), as well as alternative mechanisms such as mere association (Studies 2 and 3a). We demonstrate that, like contact-based contagion, intention-based contagion results from beliefs in transferred essence (Study 1) and involves beliefs in transfer of actual properties (Study 4). However, unlike contact-based contagion, intention-based contagion does not appear to be as strongly related to the emotion of disgust (Study 1) and can influence evaluations in auditory as well as visual modalities (Studies 3a–3c).",

All power of fancy over reason is a degree of insanity; but while this power is such as we can controul and repress, it is not visible to others, nor considered as any depravation of the mental faculties: it is not pronounced madness but when it comes ungovernable, and apparently influences speech or action.*",

This is an incorrect understanding, because to accept is something less than to love. To accept another person means saying: be as you are!, whereas to love means treating another person in a way that that person might continuously develop and become ever more like Jesus, i.e. become the most beautiful version of itself. Love supports the development of the person loved, however, to mistake love for acceptance deprives one of the motivation to work on oneself. Experience teaches that the degree of development and maturity already attained suffices at the most for today, but not for tomorrow. The one who does not progress, is in danger of regression. One who loves, accepts the truth regarding the characteristics and behaviour of another person, supporting in it what is positive and encouraging it to overcome that which is immature in that person or which is immature in that person's relations with other people.",

      "abstract": "From the introduction]Genuine novelty is the introduction and creation of new things, relations, and affections in the world.Human experience constantly confronts us with novelty, in surprising, intimate ways (spotting new freckles, a great cup of hot chocolate, budding flowers), and in more time-extended, sweeping ways (invention of the automobile, the Little Ice Age, the development of homo sapiens).And yet things are the same.The novel always contains what has already been as a component, but with some modification.Generically, all novelty is the outcome of some creative act, and all creative acts beget some novelty.Apart from this, the concept of novelty is not homogenous.There can be novel itemsindividual and unique things.There can be novel kinds: new sorts of things or states of affairs, new types of events.There can be novel problems and questions and concepts.All novelty involves a measure of unpredictability and a measure of breaking from the status quo.And novelty is a pervasive element of human experience.I want to take this aspect of human experience seriously when doing metaphysics; I do not want to make the world of human experience secondary to some ineffable realm.Because our experience is an aspect of the real world, an account of novelty must acknowledge that the novel things that emerge in the course of events are \"genuine.\"That is, they are metaphysically significant and ontologically real.I want to construct a metaphysic that accommodates pervasive change and novelty, one that accommodates radical novelty.This is, however, a drastic change from much contemporary metaphysical work.Often, the way change is dealt with metaphysically renders our most intimate interactions and feelings an unimportant component of reality (if it is a component at all).Thus the reworking of many fundamental notions is required in order to make sense of the ideas of 'change' and 'novelty.'One of these notions is 'possibility.'Commonly held notions of possibility, such as an existenceless form (a \"possible object\" -a plaid apple, for example), or possibility as a rearrangement of the elements of actuality (taking what actually exists and putting it in new combinations -horse + horn = unicorn), drain all significance from the notion of novelty.In this paper, I attempt to revise our notion of possibility using Bergson and Whitehead by creating a picture that does not entail \"possible objects,\" but allows for a creative actuality and radical novelty.This modified view of possibility will provide a basis for understanding higher and more complex and coordinated forms of novelty.[...",

      "abstract": "The analogy of a moving flashlight enables us to integrate three concepts that are basic but not ordinarily seen as related to each other: William James's \"stream of thought,\" Kurt Lewin's \"lifespace,\" and Harry Stack Sullivan's \"selective inattention.\" Lewin's lifespace, conceived as the psychological field at a given moment, resembles the field of objects lit up by a moving flashlight at a given moment; it has a bright center consisting of what is at the focus of attention and a fainter periphery or penumbra consisting of what is in the field but with little or no salience. James's stream of thought resembles the continual changing of this field as attention shifts and new objects of thought pass through the periphery into the center or vice versa. Sullivan's selective inattention is motivated resistance to the change from periphery to center. War becomes more likely when there is selective inattention to the following: * the enormity of the nuclear danger and possible ideas about how to prevent it (Lifton's \"psychic numbing\"); * the enormous deficit, caused partly by spending on nuclear weapons; * the human side of an enemy; realistic empathy with an enemy's fear of the self or anger at the self; and * incipient guilt feelings, such as Soviet qualms about Afghanistan or American qualms about Nicaragua.",

      "abstract": "Synergy (from the Greek word synergos), broadly defined, refers to combined or co-operative effects produced by two or more elements (parts or individuals). The definition is often associated with the holistic conviction quote that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" (Aristotle, in Metaphysics), or the whole cannot exceed the sum of the energies invested in each of its parts (e.g. first law of thermodynamics) even if it is more accurate to say that the functional effects produced by wholes are different from what the parts can produce alone. Synergy is a ubiquitous phenomena in nature and human societies alike. One well know example is provided by the emergence of self-organization in social insects, via direct or indirect interactions. The latter types are more subtle and defined as stigmergy to explain task coordination and regulation in the context of nest reconstruction in termites. An example, could be provided by two individuals, who interact indirectly when one of them modifies the environment and the other responds to the new environment at a later time. In other words, stigmergy could be defined as a particular case of environmental or spatial synergy. The system is purely holistic, and their properties are intrinsically emergent and autocatalytic. On the present work we present a \"machine\" where there is no precommitment to any particular representational scheme: the desired behaviour is distributed and roughly specified simultaneously among many parts, but there is minimal specification of the mechanism required to generate that behaviour, i.e. the global behaviour evolves from the many relations of multiple simple behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Simple orienting mechanisms permit us to capture in one or two well-defined processes the entire behavioral repertoire of the animal. The familiar psychological categories of motivation, cognition, sensation, and perception are all fused in harmonious combination in a handful of elementary mechanisms that initiate action, respond to stimulation, and guide the organism toward things that will aid its survival and reproduction. Behavior such as the avoiding reaction of Paramecium – reversal of movement in response to a sudden “change for the worse” – makes sense as part of a system of reactions that combine to produce adaptive behavior. With animals like birds or mammals, on the other hand, it is more difficult to see how things fit together. Seeking simplicity, many researchers have sought for some kind of behavioral “atom” – like the “reflex” or the “operant” – as the key to behavior in general. While this tactic has produced much interesting new knowledge, it has not paid off quite as hoped. The real key is no behavior in particular, but rather how all fit together to yield adaptation to a niche.",

      "abstract": "Human machine teaming has, for decades, been conceptualized as a function allocation (FA) or levels of autonomy (LOA) process: the human is suited for some tasks, while the machine is suitable for others, and as machines improve they take over duties previously assigned to humans.A wide variety of methods-including adaptive, adjustable, blended, supervisory and mixed initiative control, implemented discretely or continuously, as potential fields, as virtual fixture interfaces, or haptic interfaces-are derivatives of FA/LOA.We formalize FA/LOA (and all their derivatives) under a single mathematical formulation called classical shared control (CSC).Despite the widespread adoption of CSC, we prove that it fails to optimize human and robot agreement and intent if either the human or robot model displays \"intention ambiguity\" (e.g., the human's intended goal is unclear or the robot finds multiple viable solutions).Practically, this suboptimality can manifest as unnecessary and unresolvable disagreement (an unnecessary deadlock).For instance, if the robot chooses to go left around an obstacle and the human chooses to go right, CSC only provides two solutions: freeze in place or collide with the obstacle (we provide a wide variety of failure examples in [52], https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09490).We find that CSC suboptimality stems from arbitrating over model samples, rather than over models.Our key insight is thus to arbitrate over human and robot distributions; we prove this method optimizes human and robot agreement and intent and resolves deadlocking.Our key contribution is computationally efficient distribution arbitration: if the human and robot carry N h t and N R t \"intentions,\" the joint (naively) has N h t N R t intentions.In our approach, deadlock solutions have vanishingly small coefficients and only N min = arg min{N h t , N R t } non-zero coefficients remain: our joint has fewer modes than the individual agent models.We call our approach N min -sparse generalized shared control.",

      "title": "Social Psychology and the Law",
      "abstract": "Virtually every aspect of legal rules and procedures relies on assumptions about human psychology — about how individuals think, feel, and make decisions. Economics focuses on how people behave and interact as economic agents; psychology also focuses on human behavior and interaction, with specific attention to the influence of social and mental processes. Sometimes the law implicitly or explicitly incorporates findings from psychological science. For example, the law of negligence accounts for some of the limitations of human judgment in hindsight (Rachlinski, 1998). Because the hindsight bias is part of folk wisdom, legal rules have responded accordingly, such as in patent law where non- obviousness is determined by reference to secondary considerations like commercial success to “guard against slipping into the use of hindsight” (Rachlinski, 1998). But sometimes folk wisdom misunderstands human behavior and decision- making processes. Thus, for example, most people deem it unthinkable that an innocent person would confess to a crime she did not commit, in the absence of physical torture. And when folk wisdom misses the mark, it is more likely that judges, legislators, and other legal actors will fail to account for what psychological science might tell us about the human behavior in question. As one pioneer of the field of law and psychology observed over a century ago, “[Jurists] go on thinking that their legal instinct and their common sense supplies them with all that is needed” (Münsterberg, 1908). This chapter examines some of the implicit psychological assumptions about human behavior embedded in legal rules and practices. We narrow our focus specifically to social psychology, which we define as the scientific study of the ways in which individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the real, implied, or imagined presence of others (Allport, 1924).",

      "abstract": "Failure and success: One cannot come to be without the other; one comes to be always by becoming the other. Inasmuch as failure constitutes the internal horizon of success, a success is always haunted by the coming of failure, whose arrival never fails to (re)open the possibility of an immanent reversal. In fact as well as in principle, failure cannot exist without success, and success does not fail to bring with it what will ruin it, for each unsettles itself in turn only to become an other, its own other. Indeed, nothing succeeds like a failure and nothing begins to fail if it were not successful. Failure transitions into success, one is (in) the other, one succeeds the other, and vice versa. What can be said about failure and communication? Perhaps not much; words fail. To bring up, or to return to, the topic of failure in communication does not imply that the structure of symbolic exchange harbors somewhere within it the ideal of success, as though a message sent could potentially, at some other moment, be fully received. Whatever we may think, not all can be communicated. There must be a limit to communication that functions simultaneously, and paradoxically, as a permit for its possibility. This limit is by no means a mystical negativity. Rather, it is the difference between what can be expressed and what remains inexpressible—the distance that succeeds all that has been said.",

But they seemingly do not coordinate their attention with one another recursively—understanding that the other is monitoring their attention just as they are monitoring hers—in acts of joint attention, at least not in the same way as young human children. Similarly, great apes collaborate with partners in many flexible ways, but they seemingly do not coordinate with others to form mutually obligating joint goals and commitments, nor regulate the collaboration via acts of intentional communication, at least not in the same way as young human children. The hypothesis defended here is that it is precisely in their capacities to coordinate attention and action with others—that is, in their capacities for shared intentionality—that humans are most clearly distinguished from other great apes.

The emergent phenomena in human social systems are therefore even more difficult to understand than related phenomena in anthills or chemical systems. The paper introduces models of immergence and second-order emergence to explain the innovation of norms in human groups of moderate size &amp;mdash; as opposed to the the emergent phenomena in human crowds which are quite similar to the phenomena that can be observed in physical and animal systems. Modelling the innovation of norms and norm systems makes it necessary that interactions between model agents can be manifold and path-dependent, i.e. that agents have a long memory and deliberation capabilities. This is shown with an example from modelling criminal or terrorist behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Over the last two decades increasing evidence for an acute sensitivity to human gestures and attentional states in domestic dogs has led to a burgeoning of research into the social cognition of this highly familiar yet previously under-studied animal. Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) have been shown to be more successful than their closest relative (and wild progenitor) the wolf, and than man's closest relative, the chimpanzee, on tests of sensitivity to human social cues, such as following points to a container holding hidden food. The \"Domestication Hypothesis\" asserts that during domestication dogs evolved an inherent sensitivity to human gestures that their non-domesticated counterparts do not share. According to this view, sensitivity to human cues is present in dogs at an early age and shows little evidence of acquisition during ontogeny. A closer look at the findings of research on canine domestication, socialization, and conditioning, brings the assumptions of this hypothesis into question. We propose the Two Stage Hypothesis, according to which the sensitivity of an individual animal to human actions depends on acceptance of humans as social companions, and conditioning to follow human limbs. This offers a more parsimonious explanation for the domestic dog's sensitivity to human gestures, without requiring the use of additional mechanisms. We outline how tests of this new hypothesis open directions for future study that offer promise of a deeper understanding of mankind's oldest companion.",

Many animals (invertebrates, very young or very old animals) as well as some humans (infants, severely impaired individuals) do not conform to them. To provide an alternative model, animal ethics can be rooted in vulnerability as foundational ethical category. Instead of cognitive capacities that occasionally form a high threshold for a moral status, the universally shared dependency and injurability of bodily beings comes to the fore. However, vulnerability is not a mere fact but socially mediated. Any kind of perception of vulnerability – and of responsiveness to it – are predetermined by a selective moral infrastructure that reveals certain vulnerabilities (e.g. of companion animals) while concealing others (e.g. livestock animals). Yet we are not fully determined by this infrastructure and can criticize hegemonic frames of perceiving and treating animals though we are never outside those structures that frame animals.",

Participants performed a series of sorting tasks using stimulus cards illustrating various part and part combinations of these objects; the cards were constructed so that the same strategies could be used to categorize all three objects. Dissimilarity data were analysed using multidimensional scaling techniques. Results indicated that the human body was organized differently from the other objects, and that categorization did not follow the animate–inanimate distinction. Although animate objects were represented more on their visual characteristics and inanimate objects were represented more on functional characteristics, the human body was represented on its ability to perform actions. Representations of the other objects suggested that their organization was embodied in that they appear to be shaped by how the human body interacts, or doesn't interact, with the object.",

      "title": "Tower of Babel: Variation in Ethical Approaches, Concepts of Welfare and Attitudes to Genetic Manipulation",
      "abstract": "Abstract Attitudes to animal biotechnology are diverse, partly because people have different viewpoints and often do not recognize or acknowledge this to be so. First, people adopt different ethical approaches. If an opponent of genetic manipulation says’ I don't like the idea of altering animals ‘biology’ and a proponent replies’… but it is useful’, they are failing to communicate, because one is asking whether the action is right or wrong, whereas the other emphasizes the consequences. Another approach focuses on the person carrying out the action. Many people have hybrid views combining elements of these different approaches. Second, people ‘s concepts of welfare vary, emphasizing animal minds, bodies or natures - or a combination of these. A proponent who argues that a particular genetic change will not cause suffering is unlikely to reassure an opponent who puts more emphasis on naturalness than on feelings or health. An improved dialogue, in which people attempt to understand one another's viewpoints, may enable common principles to be established and practical measures to be taken that enable more cooperation in attempts to improve both human and animal welfare.",

We shall see the evidential or cognitive importance of how humans respond to such dissonance.

      "abstract": "In recent decades, with advances in the behavioral, cognitive, and neurosciences, the idea that patterns of human behavior may ultimately be due to factors beyond our conscious control has increasingly gained traction and renewed interest in the age-old problem of free will. To properly assess what, if anything, these empirical advances can tell us about free will and moral responsibility, we first need to get clear on the following questions: Is consciousness necessary for free will? If so, what role or function must it play? Are agents morally responsible for actions and behaviors that are carried out automatically or without conscious control or guidance? Are they morally responsible for actions, judgments, and attitudes that are the result of implicit biases or situational features of their surroundings of which they are unaware? What about the actions of somnambulists or cases of extreme sleepwalking where consciousness is largely absent? Clarifying the relationship between consciousness and free will is imperative if we want to evaluate the various arguments for and against free will. For example, do compatibilist reasons- responsive and deep self accounts require consciousness? If so, are they threatened by recent developments in the behavior, cognitive, and neurosciences? What about libertarian accounts of free will? What powers, if any, do they impart to consciousness and are they consistent with our best scientific theories about the world? In this survey piece, I will outline and assess several distinct views on the relationship between consciousness and free will.",

Although terms such as self‐mutilation and deliberate self‐harm have also been used for this behavior, NSSI has increasingly become the term of choice. Common examples of NSSI include skin‐cutting, burning, scratching, needle‐sticking, rubbing against rough surfaces, hitting or banging body parts, and interfering with wound healing. In general, behaviors associated with eating disorders (e.g., binging or purging) and substance disorders (e.g., alcohol or drug use) are not considered NSSI, because they are not accompanied by specific intent to physically damage one's body tissue. Similarly, most cases of tattooing and body piercing are not considered NSSI, because they are socially sanctioned forms of body decoration or artistic expression. Importantly, NSSI can be distinguished from suicidal behavior. Unlike suicide attempts, NSSI is not performed with the intent to die, and the injuries caused by NSSI are rarely life‐threatening or medically severe (Klonksy &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2007).",

      "title": "Conflict: A Catalyst for Institutional Change",
      "abstract": "Introduction Conflict, simply defined, is a state of disharmony between incompatible or opposing persons, ideas, or interests. When asked to close their eyes and envision a recent conflict, most people will experience a disheartening feeling. They may notice physical or emotional signs of distress (e.g., palpitations, rapid breathing, sweaty palms, shaking, tearing, etc.). Therefore they tend to assign a negative connotation to conflict as a general concept. They view conflict as something to be avoided at all costs. But conflict is natural, and even when one acquires the skills to deal with it more effectively it continues to exist (ESR, 1998). It surrounds us on a daily basis, and while it might make us feel stressed, frustrated, angry, scared, or confused, it can offer new and positive opportunities for change, learning, and growth. same holds true for conflicts of interest and/or commitment within an organization. Again, by simple definition, a conflict of interest and/or commitment exists when there is a state of disharmony between one's responsibilities as an employee/member of a specific institution/ organization and an outside entity. Both the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Association of Universities (AAU) have adopted this definition: The term individual conflict of interest in science refers to situations in which financial considerations may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, an investigator's professional judgment in conducting or reporting (Broccolo & Klanica, 2006). Yet, dealing effectively with the conflict of interest situation can also lead to positive opportunities for change, learning, and growth. In essence, a potential conflict of interest or commitment is not inherently a bad thing. Often it means there is good work happening that will contribute to generalizable knowledge and benefit society. External or extramural financial interests often drive the research in ways that internal funding alone cannot by providing a direction to research that will result in the largest possible positive impact on society. Kalichman and Macrina (2001) state that conflicts encountered through the scientific profession are to be expected, it is how they are handled that can lead to untoward, inappropriate, or bad outcomes. Therefore, there is no shame in having external financial relationships, whether as an individual or an institution as a whole. shame is in allowing those relationships to potentially bias the work, create false presumptions and distort decision-making, or in hiding the fact that they exist in the first place. Maintaining even minimal standards of research integrity is dependent upon protecting and preserving not only the integrity of the science, but that of the researcher and the institution. There is also a fundamental obligation to preserve and sustain the public trust. public trust is a fragile thing and once shattered it is almost impossible to repair (Schaller-Demers, 2006). Bradley (2005) says there is a concern that an escalating climate of secrecy and economic competition is contributing to the public's loss of confidence in the integrity of science and scientists, if not an actual deterioration in the quality of the science. If one accepts that public trust is what drives public funding, it may be logical to assume that once public trust is eroded, public funding will erode as well (Cohen, 2002). Broccolo and Klanica (2006) state that instances of research misconduct can be motivated by the types of financial and associational (non-financial) interests that give rise to potential conflicts of interest and that the media and the public cannot distinguish the difference between actual conflict and perceptions of conflict. That is why perception and appearances are so important. Hiding is never the answer, because upon close examination, it may be determined that an actual conflict of interest doesn't even exist. …",

      "abstract": "Maximizing Prudent Behavior (practicing the Virtue of Prudence) is what Smith means by the concept of self-interest (caring for one’s self). The primacy of the virtue of Prudence was established by Aristotle based on earlier discussions by Plato. All of the other major founders of different systems of virtue ethics (for example, Confucius or Buddha or Aquinas) have emphasized prudence, since it is not possible to give anything to anyone else if you have not been successful in attaining income or financial resources yourself. There can thus never be any conflict between Self-interest (Prudence) and Benevolence (Beneficence), since these virtues deal with different situations confronted by a follower of virtue ethics at different times in their lives. Applying the virtue of Beneficence can only possibly occur after the practice of prudence has been implemented successfully. There will always be a significant lag in time during which the prudent individual has been successful in attaining financial resources and circumstances occurring which will allow him/her to later practice beneficence. Only after they have successfully attained significant financial resources through prudent behavior will they be in a position to practice benevolence (beneficence). Smith would have considered it obvious that the baker, brewer and butcher had to practice the virtue of prudence first, and be successful, before that could practice the virtue of benevolence (beneficence) second.",

Archetypical conciousness is understood as a special step in the emergence of the human mind, thought and self-consciousness. The freedom of thinking--as the highest function of the human mind--is lost in every psychotic disorder. Archetypical consciousness with its lower stages of thinking may be typical for one kind of psychotic thinking disorder.

      "abstract": "Abstract Imposing a norm-based, expectational discipline on one another, the humanoids will be motivated by the fear of anyone’s defection to manifest their expectations to that individual, exhorting them to conform. They will say, ‘You should and can conform’, ascribing but also reinforcing that capacity. Let the person fail, however, and in the absence of a (full) excuse—a failure of rationality, knowledge, or voluntariness—they will reaffirm ex post the ability ascribed ex ante in exhortation: ‘You should and could have conformed’. And viewing the breach of the norm in that way—as one that occurred in the presence of a capacity to conform—they will intuitively blame or censure the offender. They will be positioned to do this, moreover, by identifying with the ex-ante exhortation of someone else or even with the self-exhortation of the agent. Perhaps that agent’s active self-exhortation—‘I can conform’—or perhaps a standby variant: this will materialize when the individual manifestly commits to the norm and is positioned so that any temptation to defect will raise a red flag, alerting them exhortatively to its appeal. In the emerging sense of blame, they will be able to interiorize the exercise and blame themselves as well. To the extent that someone is self-exhortatively effective in holding themselves to shared norms and values—or more personal counterparts—they will be possessed of free will in an intuitively recognizable sense: in a sense in which it is constituted by willpower.",

      "abstract": "It is investigated whether killing delicts as a \"solution\" of conflicts between partners are the expression of a fateful situative restraint, or whether it is the personal disposition of the committer which entails killing. The fundamentals of the discussion are examinations of 98 criminals with killing delicts, 36 of whom \"solved\" a conflict in partnership by killing the partner. The 36 separation crimes can be subdivided into four groups according to the prevailing causes. 16 happened due to the partner's intention to leave, 14 due to humiliation and severe offence, 3 due to material self-interest, and 3 in states of delusion. For each of the four groups a typical representative in his constellation of situation and personality is described. Generalized, it will be questioned under which circumstances someone develops the will to kill the partner, and who possesses the capability to realize this will. It can be shown by systematical exploration of their personality by means of objective personality testing procedures that almost all criminals who have committed murder show a conspicuous structure of personality. Hysterical and/or sociopathic properties predispose a person to acts of personally-impertinent or personally-short-sighted violence.",

      "title": "The effects of individual housing on mice and rats: a review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Isolating an animal refers to the situation where the animal is physically fully demarcated from conspecifics without physical, visual, olfactory and auditory contact. Animals housed in separate cages in the same room are, although deprived of physical and visual contact, still in olfactory and auditory contact, and thus not totally isolated. During the fifties and sixties several studies claimed to show physiological and behavioural differences between individually and group housed rats and mice. The so-called ‘Isolation Syndrome’ characterised by changes in corticosterone levels, metabolism, growth, and behaviour was introduced, rather as a model for psychoneurosis than through any concern for animal welfare. Today, it is often stated as common knowledge in laboratory animal science textbooks that individual housing as well as isolation of rats and mice has an effect on physiology and behaviour. It is, however, unclear whether this effect actually impairs animal welfare. The aim of this paper is to analyse studies on individual housing of mice and rats to evaluate whether there is documented proof that individual housing affects welfare, and, alternatively whether it is possible to house these animals individually without negative impact on welfare, eg by providing special housing improvements. A range of studies have shown that individual housing or isolation has effects on corticosterone, the open field behaviour, barbiturate sleeping time and the metabolism of different pharmaceuticals in the animals. However, this review of 37 studies in rats and 17 studies in mice showed divergence in test results difficult to explain, as many studies lacked basal information about the study, eg information on genetic strains and housing conditions, such as bedding, enrichment and cage sizes. Furthermore, test and control groups most frequently differed in cage sizes and stocking densities, and behavioural tests differed in ways which may very well explain the differences in results. Overall, there seemed to be an effect of individual housing, although it may be small, and it seems reasonable to assume that, through making small changes in the procedures and housing environments, the effects can be minimised or even eliminated. More well-controlled and standardised studies are needed to give more specific answers to the questions this issue poses.",

      "title": "Multiple Intelligences within Agricultural Education",
      "abstract": "Developed by psychologist Howard Gardner, the theory of multiple intelligences asserts that there are at least eight ways that people have of perceiving and understanding the world. The labels identify a distinct or set of skills individuals utilize in problem solving situations. It is important to note that although most individuals tend to be stronger in one or more multiple intelligence categories, everyone has all eight intelligences. It is the difference and combinations that makes each and every student different, and why as educators, we must learn to teach to the student, not the Multiple intelligences can be an excellent way of embracing and fostering the diversity of our students. Intelligence is defined by Gardner as a group of abilities that: * Is somewhat autonomous from other human capacities; * Has a core set of informationprocessing operations; * Has a distinct history in the stages of development we each pass through; and * Has plausible roots in evolutionary history. Gardner has categorized and defined intelligence into the following eight categories: * Visual-Spatial-The ability to visualize objects and spatial dimensions * Verbal-Linguistic-The ability to use words and language * Interpersonal-The capacity for person-to-person communications and relationships * Musical-Rhythmic-The ability to recognize tonal patterns and sounds * Naturalistic-Thinks by finding patterns in the natural world: cycles, seasons, processes * Body-Kinesthetic-The wisdom of the body and the ability to control physical motion * Intrapersonal-The spiritual, inner states of being, self-reflection, and awareness * Logical-Mathematical-The capacity for inductive and deductive thinking. Consciously or not, the ability of a student to learn, in a particular subject area, is relative to their strengths in a particular multiple intelligence. All teachers can identify with these statements, I have a fantastic young man who can weld and build anything, but has a hard time getting up in front of the class, or My chapter president gets perfect grades, but some of the other students have a hard time working with her, or He is such a hard worker on the farm, but not so hard in his math class. As educators, we all recognize that students learn differently, but sometimes do not directly recognize the how. Agricultural Education has the premier educational delivery system to cater to all students' learning styles and multiple intelligences. Given that traditional schooling and testing usually only addresses verbal-linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences and given that agricultural education classrooms usually include very diverse learners, it became apparent that a list of activities within all of the intelligences would aid educators in reaching all of the students in their program. Visual-Spatial-The ability to visualize objects and spatial dimensions, and create internal images and pictures. Students strong in this intelligence tend to think in pictures and need to create vivid mental images to retain information. When you think of an apple, do you see the word, or do you create a mental picture of an apple? * Draw and label the parts of the flower * Create an FFA/agricultural education program brochure * Evaluate a soil map/topographical map/profile * Landscape class - drawing/reading plans - Interpret landscape design * Agricultural construction - reading blue prints * Plant/tool/breed identification - compare classes * Velcro diagram of wholesale/retail cuts * Product displays in agricultural business * Interactive computer software Verbal-Linguistic-The ability to use words and language. Students strong in this intelligence have highly developed auditory skills and are generally elegant speakers. …",

      "title": "Early Theory of Mind development - Are infants inherently altercentric?",
      "abstract": "Human social interaction is characterized by the ability to reason about other individuals’ unobservable mental states, referred to as Theory of Mind. For decades, this ability was believed to develop around the age of 4 years, when children start passing the false belief task. In recent years, however, novel infant Theory of Mind tasks have shown that, already in their first two years of life, infants make correct predictions of how agents with a false belief are going to act. These findings have triggered a controversial debate on when Theory of Mind develops and whether infants already have a full-fledged Theory of Mind.Here, we suggest that infants might solve the novel infant Theory of Mind tasks due to an altercentric modulation of their own representation of the world, rather than by entertaining two divergent representations – the others’ and their own perspective. We propose an enhanced social encoding mechanism through which infants acquire a stronger representation of events experienced together with another person than events that are only witnessed by the child alone. This mechanism allows the infant to predict others’ actions in line with their representation of the world, but also predicts that infants produce reality errors where, in their own expectations about the world, they are influenced more by what the other believes to be the case than what infants themselves should know to be the case. While adaptive in infancy, when the child has limited abilities to act on the world and is highly dependent on others, we propose that this mechanism changes towards the end of the second year of life when children acquire an explicit concept of themselves. The presence of a self-concept highlights the child’s own perspective on the world and leads to the typical egocentric errors committed by 3-year-olds in the traditional false belief tasks. Only when maturing executive abilities allow the child to maintain two different representations simultaneously, and to meta-represent one of these, around the age of 4 years, do children become able to flexibly reason about others mental states on traditional false belief tasks.",

      "abstract": "Health is not merely an absence of disease or infirmity but a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being [1].What then is a 'dis-ease' and what is a considered to be a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being?Being 'healthy' is often based on a statistical norm of 'normalcy' -the basis for most diagnostic tests.Health care as a biopsychosocial model is going through a transformation as shown in Table I.In the newer model, causes, development and outcomes of an illness are not looked at in isolation but are determined by physiology, biochemistry and their interaction with psychological, social and cultural factors.Human being is not merely a physical reality but a continuum of consciousness or awareness with the physical body at one end of this awareness spectrum.In complex systems, the whole is more than the sum of its components expressing properties not seen or predicted from the individual components [2].Many of the behavioral health factors such as freedom from physical and emotional pain, freedom from selfishness, increased adaptability, and creativity define health to a complementary and alternative or CAM practitioner [3] and are consistent with a Lorenz attractor pattern, attractors that balance entropy and provide dynamic order out of chaos.There is thus a need for a more meaningful unifying explanation for health and disease in order to better understand the role of interventions in various health care modalities.

      "abstract": "Free emotion and dependant emotion are two different emotions existent in human beings.The former is stimulated by such an object that has no any direct utility relations with the emotional subjects,mostly attributable to a reaction of pure spirit or mentality,and just to a kind of mental feeling.On the contrary,the latter happens when there exists obvious utility or possesional relations between the stimuli and the emotional subjects.Some of these stimuli which are usually external objects can bring actual gains or losses to the emotional subjects;while some others,which mainly refer to natural human desires,are attached to the partial physiological function of the emotional subjects.Thus,the dependant emotion is virtually the causal or utilitarian one.Generally speaking,most of love,kinship and friendship are actually of the dependant emotion,but love,kinship and friendship in the form of free emotions are rather scarce in reality.Fortunately,this scarcity can be compensated owing to the existence of the artworks.Although artworks aren't natural aesthetic objects,they can trigger the free emotion of the aesthetic subjects much more easily than other aesthetic objects under equal conditions because of the shortage of the evident practical utility between them.",

What is being experienced unconsciously can go against the tendency to repeat, because the unconscious and conscious response of the analyst does not repeat the closing and/or the intrusiveness of the primary environment. The necessary receptivity required from the analyst and his/her unconscious capacity to accept an active passivation and a state of relative selflessness supposes that his/her narcissistic defences can be suspended to allow for working through rather than acting out. The unconsciousness of the analyst's mental life can be seen as a safeguard to the liveliness of the process. Just as his unconscious defences can sometimes hinder the ongoing development of the analytic process and elaboration. Interpretation only comes as an end result of a sustained contact and intercourse of the analyst's hopefully lively unconscious mental life and that of the analysand. Overcoming the risk that excitation prevails over tenderness is part and parcel of the constant unconscious working through of the analyst. The acting out works as a soul murder and tends to destroy the potential fecundity of the analytic encounter.",

A similar dichotomy can be found in\r\nother traditions, in which childhood is conceived of as the heavenly kingdom or the state before the acquisition of knowledge.\r\nThis means that the acquisition of understanding is seen as something negative. The idea of childhood is a constant\r\nin evangelical teachings, as in these words from the Gospel according to St Matthew: »Except ye be converted, and become\r\nas little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.« Similarly in St Luke; »Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom\r\nof God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.« In Christian tradition angels are often shown as children, which\r\nis a sign of innocence and purity.

Eventually, the critical dimensions of mature thought are developed. Achieving the capacity for mature thought in which logical thinking plays an important part depends on the opportunity that the individual finds in the transactional environment of people, things, and patterned events. It proceeds through a spontaneous capacity for growth and development. It will occur in proper sequence, proportion and in balance if the individual is an actor in his own learning and if the environment is suitably designed to support all the developing mental capacities of the individual. The individual must always be acting in a patterned whole environment which displays structure, interdependence, and order in the parts. A valid sub-whole must be totally present for the child to interact with. The teacher must be aware of the sub-whole, present varied manifestations of it and display it in manipulable form. An unordered environment, or one beyond the rudimentary organizational capacities of the individual, cannot be understood by him and can support only primitive assimilation. A too ordered repetitive environment, without varied content, can support only accommodation per se imitation. Neither will build the mind nor lead to the achievement of logical thought. To summarize thus far, learning theories can contain directives for the development of logical thought for education in the elementary school and for reading instruction. Among these directives are the following: 1. The learner must be active in the environment. He is only beginning to think according to a mental review of the actions he would take in solving a problem as an actor in the environment. He uses and rearranges mental summaries (or abstractions) of events in the environment according to strategies or logical operations abstracted from procedures used as actor in the environment.

      "title": "Notes on the Synthesis of Form",
      "abstract": "Every design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context. The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem. We want to put the context and the form into effortless contact or frictionless coexistence, i.e., we want to find a good fit. For a good fit to occur in practice, one vital condition must be satisfied. It must have time to happen. In slow-changing, traditional, unselfconscious cultures, a form is adjusted soon after each slight misfit occurs. If there was good fit at some stage in the past, no matter how removed, it will have persisted, because there is an active stability at work. Tradition and taboo dampen and control the rate of change in an unselfconscious culture's designs. It is important to understand that the individual person in an unselfconscious culture needs no creative strength. He does not need to be able to improve the form, only to make some sort of change when he notices a failure. The changes may not always be for the better; but it is not necessary that they should be, since the operation of the process allows only the improvements to persist. Unselfconscious design is a process of slow adaptation and error reduction. In the unselfconscious process there is no possibility of misconstruing the situation. Nobody makes a picture of the context, so the picture cannot be wrong. But the modern, selfconscious designer works entirely from a picture in his mind - a conceptualization of the forces at work and their interrelationships - and this picture is almost always wrong. To achieve in a few hours at the drawing board what once took centuries of adaptation and development, to invent a form suddenly which clearly fits its context - the extent of invention necessary is beyond the individual designer. A designer who sets out to achieve an adaptive good fit in a single leap is not unlike the child who shakes his glass-topped puzzle fretfully, expecting at one shake to arrange the bits inside correctly. The designer's attempt is hardly as random as the child's is; but the difficulties are the same. His chances of success are small because the number of factors which must fall simultaneously into place is so enormous. The process of design, even when it has become selfconscious, remains a process of error-reduction. No complex system will succeed in adapting in a reasonable amount of time or effort unless the adaptation can proceed component by component, each component relatively independent of the others. The search for the right components, and the right way to build the form up from these components, is the greatest challenge faced by the modern, selfconscious designer. The culmination of the modern designer's task is to make every unit of design both a component and a system. As a component it will fit into the hierarchy of larger components that are above it; as a system it will specify the hierarchy of smaller components of which it itself is made.",

But one of the contributions of the flow concept has been to remind us that activity and experience are ultimately independent of each other.

It is impossible to explain the quality of the experience by reference to the objective conditions of the environment, or by reference to the person alone; only the interaction between the two yields the answer.",

      "title": "Deleuze on Habit",
      "abstract": "Deleuze on Habit Brian O'Keeffe Habits hook us into our sense of self-consistency: we sense life's pattern as our habits stabilize time's flux into predictable routine. To have habits is to set down a multiplicity of little anchors into that flux, each habit constituting a continuum of behavior persisting over time. Of course, too much routine can be a bad thing. But a life with no habits is no life at all, or else it is a fickle existence, unmoored and mercurial. A person without habits sticks at nothing. On the matter of habit, then, it is all about getting the balance right. In The Gay Science, Nietzsche writes: Brief habits.—I love brief habits and consider them an invaluable means for getting to know many things and states down to the bottom of their sweetnesses and bitternesses; my nature is designed entirely for brief habits […]. Enduring habits, however, I hate, and feel as if a tyrant has come near me and the air around me is thickening when events take a shape that seems inevitably to produce enduring habits—for instance, owing to an official position, constant relations with the same people, a permanent residence, or uniquely good health. Yes, at the very bottom of my soul I am grateful to all my misery and illnesses and whatever is imperfect in me because they provide a hundred back doors through which I can escape enduring habits. To me the most intolerable, the truly terrible, would of course be a life entirely without habits, a life that continually demanded improvisation—that would be my exile and my Siberia. (167–68) Brevity is the soul of habit. Enduring habits only lead to a clotted, coagulated existence made up of burdensome obligation. Consider his resistance to the obligation to be always in good health: imagine the impudent pleasure one gets in telling the doc—always concerned to impose the doctrine of \"wellness\"—that one has a pack-a-day smoking habit, and then sitting back to enjoy the scolding lecture with indifference. Illness, a hacking smoker's cough, or a slightly enlarged liver, can be escape routes from the irritating officiousness of the sane, the well, and the well-meaning. Yet, if Nietzsche detests enduring habits, what is worse is having no habits. A life that never settled into any routine at all would be a skittish kind of life, so mercurial and improvised—wholly new at each instant—it would be like living in the gulag. Siberia, for Nietzsche, is a sort of nowhere place of utter inconstancy. [End Page 71] Elsewhere in philosophy, opinions on the matter of habit are sometimes mixed, sometimes starkly pro or con. For Kant, thinking of the moral subject, obeying the law out of mere habit is dangerously lax. Habitual action is too passive, whereas real obedience requires a strenuous act of will. Habitual thinking edges into thoughtlessness, whereas moral action requires a moment of lucid deliberation, particularly vis-à-vis one's moral maxims. For the Aristotle of the Nichomachean Ethics, on the other hand, \"virtue of character is a result of habituation\" (23). The virtuous person acquires good character in various ways—it helps to have upstanding role-models and congenial circumstances for the flowering of goodness, but one also needs opportunities to practice and gain experience so that doing good will feel second nature. \"The person who is to be good must be nobly brought up and habituated,\" Aristotle writes, \"and then spend his life engaged in good pursuits\" (201). Morality offers an initial sense of the importance of habit to philosophy, but gaining any greater purchase on the topic is hampered by the sheer mystery of habit. How do they begin and take hold? How are we aware of having habits? To answer such questions entails tolerating a messy blurring of the neat dichotomies and oppositions that conventionally shape philosophical enquiry. One problem is the extent to which a habit is both involuntary and voluntary, since while having a habit seems to induce a certain passivity, the will nonetheless exerts itself—the smoker actively motivates himself to reach for another cigarette. When the will is involved, to some...",

      "title": "Scene hierarchy structures object representations while flexibly adapting to varying task demands",
      "abstract": "Objects are arranged in the environment following certain rules which we have termed “scene grammar”, that we exploit to perceive and interact with objects in an efficient way. We have recently proposed that this organization is hierarchical: objects are grouped together based on the scene they typically appear in (e.g., bathroom); based on the different spatial clusters of objects within a scene (“phrases”, e.g., the sink phrase); and based on the status they have within a phrase, where one object (“anchor”, e.g., the sink) typically holds strong predictions about the identity and position of other objects (“local objects”, e.g., a toothbrush). Here we investigate if mental representations of objects reflect this hierarchy and which behavioural goal strengthens this organization. To do so, we collected pairwise similarity judgments for triplets of everyday objects, using an odd-one-out task with different task instructions: in one case, similarity had to be judged based on action goals performed with these objects; in another case, similarity was judged based on visual appearance of objects; finally, similarity ratings were collected without explicit instructions. Results showed that measures of scene hierarchy had stronger impact on similarity judgments for the “action goal” task and the “no instructions” task than for the “visual appearance” task; some aspects of the hierarchy, like “phrase” organization, were even more important to make similarity judgments based on action goals than without explicit instructions. Moreover, measures that estimate visual features of objects had a stronger effect on similarity when judged based on visual appearance than in the other tasks. To conclude, our study shows that scene hierarchy shapes mental representation of objects and that this cognitive organization can flexibly change according to behavioural goals. Besides, it suggests that scene hierarchy is exploited with the purpose of efficient interaction with objects in the environment.",

      "title": "Cognitive Robotic Engine: Behavioral Perception Architecture for Human-Robot Interaction",
      "abstract": "For personal or domestic service robots to be successful in market, it is essential for them to have capability of natural and dependable interaction with human. However, such a natural and dependable human-robot interaction (HRI) is not so easy to accomplish, as it involves a high level of robotic intelligence for recognizing and understanding human speech, facial expression, gesture, behavior, and intention as well as for generating a proper response to human with artificial synthesis. It is our view that first key step toward a successful deployment of HRI is to level up dependability of a robot for recognizing intention of human counterpart. For instance, to date, robotic recognition of human speech, as well as human gestures, facial expressions, let alone human intention, is still quite unreliable in a natural setting, despite tremendous effort by researchers to perfect machine perception. We observe that robustness and dependability human enjoys in human-human interaction may not merely come from fact that human has powerful perceptual organs such as eyes and ears but human is capable of executing a series of behaviors associated with a perceptual goal, for instance, behaviors related to collection of additional evidences till decision is sufficiently credible. In analogy, we claim here that dependability of robotic recognition of human intention for HRI may not come from perfection of individual capabilities for recognizing speech, gesture, facial expression, etc. But, it comes with automatic generation of robotic behaviors that makes sure of reaching a credible decision for given perceptual goal.We present here “Cognitive Robotic Engine (CRE)” that automatically generates such perceptual behaviors as selecting and collecting an optimal set of evidences, for dependable and robust recognition of human intention under a high level of uncertainty and ambiguity. CRE is to demonstrate that dependability of robotic perception may not come from the perfection of individual components for perception, but from the integration of individual components into dependable system behaviors, no matter how imperfect and uncertain individual components may be. CRE presents a novel robotic architecture featuring 1) spontaneous establishment of ad-hoc missions in connection to perceptual goals, 2) determination of an optimal set of evidences to be selected and/or collected for processing based on in-situ monitoring of current situation, 3) integration of such behavioral building blocks as mission management, evidence selection, evidence",

      "abstract": "Bodily expressions of emotion are powerful signals regulating communicative exchanges. For better or worse, we spend our life surrounded by other people. Nothing is less surprising than to assume that we are trained and over-trained to read their body language. When we see someone running with the hands protecting his face we perceive at once the fear and the action of running for cover. We rarely hesitate to assign meaning to such behaviors, and we do not wait to recognize fight behavior till we are close by enough to see the person's facial expression. Here we report on new findings concerning the role of attention and of visual awareness on the perception and neurofunctional basis of our ability to recognize bodily expressions. Our experiments show that briefly seen, but also consciously unseen bodily stimuli may induce an emotional state and trigger adaptive actions in the observer. Exposure to unseen emotional stimuli triggers activity in the cortical and subcortical visual system and is associated with somatic changes typical of emotions. Specifically, unattended but also non-consciously perceived emotional body expressions elicit spontaneous facial expressions and psychophysiological changes that reflect the affective valence and arousal components of the stimuli. Similar results are also obtained in neurologically intact subjects in whom blindsight-like effects are induced by visual masking. Moreover, participants facial reactions are faster and autonomic arousal is higher for unseen than for seen stimuli. We will discuss the implications of these findings for current debates in human emotion theories.",

      "title": "Resonance between sense, plasticity, and biosemiosis",
      "abstract": "A quick glance in a dictionary shows that 'resonance' and the verb 'to resonate' operate, even in their simplest definitions, across diverse literal and figural meanings: in registers belonging to the physical and quantitatively observable domain (particle physics, molecular chemistry, acoustics, electricity, bodily vibration as measured in medical science or phonetics), but also across those belonging to the realm of affective, symbolic, or qualitatively lived experience (positive emotional feeling, collective cultural response, inheritance, or transmission). What all these modalities of resonance have in common is arguably the sense of a putting into relation of elements through a propagation or prolongation of effects, which can, in turn, yield or generate a form. More precisely, resonance might be described, either literally or figuratively, as a vibratory effect which, as both a relation and also a directional or multidirectional cause, can create, perpetuate, or transform forms.",

      "abstract": "This chapter presents an analysis of the fundamental processes of believing (not belief content) and their relationship to communicating with unseen entities – whether it be a god, spirit, dead loved one, or other otherworldly or this-worldly construct or entity. The behaviors involved may include prayer, ritual, sacrifice, or nothing extra-ordinary, and may be individual or group, take variable lengths of time, may or may not require evidence of the validity of having communicated, and may yield what is seen as explicit confirmation of the reason for communicating, or no \"results\" at all. Psychologically, believing involves making meaning out of ambiguity, imagining, and other cognitive constructions. It draws no conclusions about whether what is believed is false or true. Believing is the connecting link that holds other fundamental psychological processes such as perception, value attribution, and learning, as well as interpersonal processes such as communicating, together. It is mostly below conscious awareness from the micro to macro levels; a small proportion of it becomes conscious. This chapter puts communicating with unseen entities squarely under the neurophysiological microscope, while also accounting for cultural mechanisms and having applied implications.",

Humans use symbols that relate to in-group psychology, loyalty, power, and remembrance. Such symbols often have a strong emotional charge, and may lead to overvalued or mistaken beliefs and magical thinking. Graves, flags, and the Christian Eucharist are examples. Some symbols are private and personal. Some symbols are unrecognized and exert their influence through unconscious processes. Other human symbols relate to the new function of language and do not have the same emotional power. Some evidence is presented that symbols work by an ‘as if’ mechanism, using some of the same neural circuits that the thing symbolized uses. People can think in symbols, for example, a sentence can use the word dog without either the speaker or the listener having a mental image of a dog.",

Perhaps all concepts, categories, and word meanings (CC&Ms) are constructed ad hoc, each time we use them. On this proposal, all words are infinitely polysemous, all communication is ’good enough’, and no idea is ever the same twice. The details of people’s ad hoc CC&Ms are determined by the way retrieval cues interact with the physical, social, and linguistic context. We argue that even the most stable-seeming CC&Ms are instantiated via the same processes as those that are more obviously ad hoc, and vary (a) from one microsecond to the next within a given instantiation, (b) from one instantiation to the next within an individual, and (c) from person to person and group to group as a function of people’s experiential history.",

It is essential for the fulfillment of man’s social, physical and intellectual needs and obligations. It is an essential requirement for all human interactions. Even deaf and dumb persons communicate though they are bereft of the faculties of hearing and speech. They have not been endowed with the ability to interact through the use of language as man has been interacting among all living creatures. Communication takes place not only through words. It takes place more effectively through facial expressions, body language, symbols etc. Communication is a general feature of all existence on this earth. The world cannot exist without it .we have no choice but we must communicate whether we have inclination for it or not. Even if we try to avoid communication with some people on some occasions by not responding to them it is still a sort of communication though it will not be effective communication. In the conclusion, we can say that communication is a systematic process",

Lewis-Williams’ neuropsychological model draws on these reports to gain insights into the minds of Paleolithic people, on the basis of shared neurobiology and given comparative ethnographic data on ritualized ASCs. Helvenston has long rejected this model because in many ASCs hallucinations do not always adhere to a strict 1-2-3 sequence, because they do not always feature animals, and because people do not always lose their critical faculties. She is right, but she is attacking a straw man because these criteria are her own. Helvenston’s claims about the effects of psychoactive compounds and sensory deprivation are also questionable. It remains an open question how our Turing pattern model relates to more figurative forms of hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "[Abstract]: Interactions amongst individuals and in larger organisations are intimately bound to the\nreality of the human being. From the simple fact that all sentient beings feel pleasure and\npain, it follows that they must take action to avoid harm or promote benefit, in ways that\nsuit their total reality. However, humans have a uniquely flexible mind and a language\ncapable of communicating subtle or abstract thoughts. As a consequence, humans can ask\nquestions on these matters with a depth that is revolutionary in terms of existence on this\nplanet. This revolutionary new capacity must not be squandered by denying the objective\nand universal nature of the ethical discussion undertaken by individuals, groups and\nsocieties. Human goods are frequently intangible, but this should not mislead us into\nthinking that they are less real than material goods.\nIn this analysis, ethics is the realm that connects individual human nature to societal realities\nsuch as laws. It does so in various conceptual dimensions. In the domain of willed action it\nrecognises that human beings are neither infallible nor omniscient, and therefore cannot give\neffect to all their plans; so there must be a realm of unenforced obligation between what is\ncompulsory (law) and what is completely free (personal preferences). In the realm of\nplanning and understanding, ethics is the connective between the realities of individual\nhuman nature and those of social organisation. These are processes of mutual influence and\nfeedback determined by reality, whether we understand that reality or not. Weaknesses in\nethical theories can lead to laws and standards that cause great harm. For example,\nAristotle's ethic contained no means of warning him of the evil of slavery - in this\nconnection we examine one modern redevelopment of Aristotle. However, if there are\nethical truths, grounded in reality, then unanticipated possibilities are opened for positively\ninfluencing human social and individual evolution.\nThe Principle of Goodness is a new realist ethical theory which acknowledges truths about human nature and the vast web of interactions within which humans live and exercise their wills. Despite its simplicity, it has much to say about how people should act ethically, with\ninfluences both by and upon individuals. The trust and security that follows from treating\nevery single one ethically as an individual will be conducive to the development of positive\nfeedback cycles of care, concern, friendship, and compassion throughout the matrix of\nhuman interaction. The challenge, then, for those who desire a world free of inequity,\nconflict and insecurity is to re-examine every social field informed by this ethics, which is\ngrounded in the inescapable reality of the human condition.",

      "abstract": "Early cognitive development benefits from nonlinguistic representations of skeletal sets of domain‐specific principles and complementary domain‐relevant data abstraction processes. The principles outline the domain, identify relevant inputs, and structure coherently what is learned. Knowledge acquisition within the domain is a joint function of such domain‐specific principles and domain‐general learning mechanisms. Two examples of early learning illustrate this. Skeletal preverbal counting principles help children sort different linguistic strings into those that function as the conventional count‐word as opposed to labels for objects in the child's linguistic community. Skeletal causal principles, working with complementary perceptual processes that abstract information about biological and nonbiological conditions and patterns of movement, lead to the rapid acquisition of knowledge about the animate‐inanimate distinction. By 3 years of age children con soy whether photographs of unfamiliar nonmammalian animals, mammals, statues, and wheeled objects portray objects capable or incapable of self‐generated motion. They also generate answers to questions about the insides of animate items more readily than ones about the insides of inanimate items. Although these children already ore articulate about matters relevant to a theory of action, their limited knowledge of growth illustrates that early skeletal principles do not rule out the need to acquire new principles, in this case ones that underlie a biological account of animacy (Carey, 1985).",

But they are not the same. Our ancestors, when creating the first linguistic systems, had little to copy; they had to build linguistic systems, in a way which we can only speculate about. This process, in whichever way it was achieved, is surely neither momentaneous nor done by a single person, and therefore, it also involved a great deal of copying from others. Nowadays, people are rarely confronted with the need to construct a new linguistic system; but everybody is confronted with the need to copy at least one existing system. This process is what we call language acquisition. It involves the copying capacity, it involves the construction capacity, it also involves—and dramatically changes—the capacity to communicate by linguistic systems. Normally, we all experience this transition in childhood, with no or little guided intervention on the part of the social environment, but it can also happen at a later age, with or without systematic intervention. Language acquisition is a natural process; it does not need tutoring. But its study is deeply shaped by a certain view that is naturally invited by the context in which",

      "abstract": "The article concerns the phenomenon of stalking, or emotional persecution. It also presents legal solutions concerning stalking in the countries where this type of behavior is penalized, and includes a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of criminalization of stalking in Poland. In contrast with the admiration, stalking is a behavior which a victim does not wish. Stalking is an English verb denoting a quiet human or animal tracking in order to capture or kill. In accordance to the definition of an American psychologist J. Reid Meloy, stalking is a form of malicious and repeated harassing and annoying of another person which increases his or her feeling of threat. Stalking, just like domestic violence, and mobbing are classified as so-called \"emotional violence\", by which we understand “interference in the psyche of another person directed against his or her emotions, resulting both immediate and delayed negative effects”. Emotional violence is never a single event. Stalking most often exhibits in such behaviors as: calls, silent calls, night calls, wandering in the vicinity of victim's home, making contact through a third party, questioning about the victim in his or her surroundings, persisting at the door / home / work, sending letters, e-mails, text messages, and gifts, placing postal orders in victim's name, tracking and following the victim, slander (distributing false information and rumors), burglary to victims house or car, stealing victim's belongings, harassing victim's family and friends, as well as attacking and assaulting them. The main problem with providing an adequate legal protection to a victim of a stalker lies in the fact that some of these behaviors are criminal, and some are not prohibited by law, nevertheless if repeated, they carry severe consequences for the victim which cannot be counteracted by means of criminal law. The tragedy of stalking victims lies in the fact that a persecutor may intimidate his victims and force them to change habits and plans, to live in constant fear. Stalker often causes huge mental suffering through actions which, under Polish law, are legally indifferent. What is also important is that actions of a stalker do not have to result from his or her wrongful intentions or desire to annoy the victim (in many law systems malicious intention of the stalker is a sine qua non for criminalization of stalking). Sometimes the persecutor acts with good intentions (the desire to win the love of a loved one), nevertheless behavior of the stalker is frightening for the victim. Results of a study taken to estimate the scale of stalking differ between countries where such studies have been conducted. This discrepancy is probably influenced by the definition assumed by researchers, research methodology, sample size and selection, but also by the different temperament of the inhabitants of these countries.",

By means of presence, actors can discover who they are at their cores and deliver a powerful message to the audience without any words.\r\nActor’s presence is available only if actor are aware of their living body. In other words, ‘Bodily-awareness’ is the decisive factor of actor’s presence. However, each actor has distinct habits which respond unconsciously and cannot be inhibited volitionally. Habits distort proprioception, the major source of bodily awareness.\r\nThere are four fundamental habits which inhibit actor's presence on stage. Namely, habitual concentration on time, space, oneself, and goals. To explain, actors have a tendency to focus on the past or the future rather than the present, and they are likely to pay attention to the audience or counterparts without being aware of their bodies and the whole space surrounding them. Furthermore, there is a big chance that actors have self-consciousness, which means comparing or evaluating themselves with the norms as opposed to bodily-awareness. Plus, actors tend to concentrate on extrinsic targets toward the audience, director, and character. These habits tenaciously make actors not mindful of their bodies.\r\nIf actors learn how they discover and inhibit their own habits, they can build their own methodologies that are able to train themselves as existent actors on stage. Alexander technique would be a powerful method to recover actor's body awareness, leading to actor's scenic presence.",

Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (Study 1) and a conspecific (Study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster or spend more time in their proximity than when they had attended to something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is present in both humans and great apes and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected.",

      "abstract": "Like other 'problems' in philosophy, any pertaining to the possibilities of learning from philosophy arise from inappropriate presuppositions.In this case it is mostly that all knowledge must be explicit and supported by reasons and evidence.But most of our knowledge is tacit and he chain of evidence for evidence ad infinitum must be ended somewhere.Fictions, including literary ones, are widely used in used in life and the sciences to draw consequences practical and theoretical consequences.Literary fictions can go beyond purely factual knowledge to reveal how it felt to live at a given time and place; to engage the whole person, and not just the thinkers, in both the characters portrayed and also in the reader or listener; to bring important matters home to them, for the heart is usually more important than the head; to show the importance of models and authoritative persons; to illustrate and apply general principles; to reveal philosophical errors such that all action is sub specie bonum by creating characters explicitly intending to do evil for because it is hurtful, cruel or vengeful; to show that there is more than formal learning to what happens in schools, and how important it can be; and generally to give narratives of what life really is or can be, and not just the abstractions and statistics of social sciences.",

      "abstract": "Everyone exhibits styles of movement and speech, traits and habits which are characteristic of them as people but do not contribute dir ectly to their purposeful activity at anyone time. Many of these will be expressions of personality of which the individual may be unaware or even cherish and which evoke a favorable or neutral response from others. Conversely, displays such as gross involuntary tics or compul sive rituals are a burden to the sufferer and are socially embarrassing or obnoxious. These may be manifestations of a more fundamental neurotic disorder or the product of deep-seated maladaptive learning. Nail-biting occupies a central position along such a spectrum. Al though it may serve as a tension-reducing or other functional device, few nail-biters would not wish to be rid of the habit but find it as difficult to eliminate as, say, an addiction to smoking. Even so, it cannot be considered abnormal in a psychiatric sense in that many nail-biters exhibit none of the traits and symptoms characteristic of mental disorder.",

      "title": "Visual search speed is influenced by differences in shape arbitrariness",
      "abstract": "We hypothesized that the visual system is particularly tuned to those features which correlate with behaviorally relevant dimensions, and compared a few possibilities: how man-made an object is (naturalness), how often an object is eaten (edibility), how often an object is manipulated (manipulability), and the degree to which an object’s shape is arbitrary (shape arbitrariness; Prasada, 2001). For example, the shape of a hammer is more constrained by the kind of thing that it is (i.e., is less arbitrary) than the shape of a rock. Does variability in perceptual similarity among sets of small, inanimate objects correlate with behavioral ratings on any of these dimensions? We chose four sets (categories) of stimuli: manipulable artifacts (e.g., pens), non-manipulable artifacts (e.g., lamps), natural objects (e.g. pinecones), and fruits/vegetables. These categories did not differ on ratings of typicality, familiarity, internal details, and visual complexity, or in area, aspect ratio, contour variance, extent, spatial frequency, contrast, or luminance. Participants searched for a target image among distractors from the same or different category; they pressed a space bar when they found the target, and reported its location by clicking X’s that replaced the original images. For each category pairing, the difference in search speeds between same- and different-category trials was taken as an index of perceptual dissimilarity, and correlated with distances in each dimension for each subject (representational similarity analysis). Neither manipulability nor edibility explained the pattern of perceptual dissimilarity among categories (all r< .1, t< 1,p>.3). Although naturalness explained some variance (r=.16, t=2.13, p=.048), shape arbitrariness explained more (r=.40, t=4.05, p< .0001). Visual features correlated with shape arbitrariness include shape symmetry and regularity, according to ratings(r=.74, p< .001). These results suggest that, among inanimate objects, the visual system may be particularly sensitive to the perceptual features correlated with the arbitrariness of their shapes.

      "title": "The \"Either or\" and Its Effects on Education",
      "abstract": "One of the most significant characteristics which appears to have continually pervaded educational thought and practice is that of the 'either-or.' This is perhaps not surprising as new, or at least, relatively new ideas are invariably introduced as either a reaction against or as some kind of remedy for felt deficiencies in a prevailing mode of thought or action. The history of education is mile-stoned with dichotomous stances: traditional/progressive; closed/open classrooms; teacher-directed/learner-directed activity; art instruction/self-expression; and so on. Indeed this would seem to be a natural order of events as any inadequacies or deficiencies in the system are invariably seen through selectively exaggerated vision and to be attacked vehemently as one would a Quixotic windmill. The new idea, to be put forward subtly or more likely not so subtly, has almost of necessity to be overstated so that the very point at issue will not be missed or the conviction with which it is put forward underestimated. As everyone knows, educational systems are conservative by nature and resistant to change so that any new idea, if it is to take root, has to be distinctly and perhaps even dramatically different from that which it is intended to replace or counter. Educational innovators would not welcome the analogy yet much of what they do in proliferating their ideas would equate them with some of the most successful ad-men of our time. Reference is frequently made almost benignly and certainly resignedly to the 'pendulum of education' which, it would seem, inexorably swings back and forth as if educational thought and practice",

      "title": "Transformation of Pathologists: Responding in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous Environment",
      "abstract": "In \"No Pay, No Play: The End of Professional Ethics in Pathology?\"1 and \"No Pay, No Play: Game Over,\"2 we noted the general discontent among pathologists and reinforced that, even so, we must remain ever professional. We did not, however, delve into the causes of the discontent, frustration, and malaise that are too often seen among pathologists nor how they might be dealt with. Why are so many pathologists frustrated and disappointed, and sometimes, burned out? Why do so many pathologists believe their contracts with society have been broken? What exactly is today's reality? What has happened, and what can be done about it?Today we pathologists live in a VUCA world: VUCA—volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity—is an acronym used to describe an environment of volatility—\"[t]he nature and dynamics of change, and the nature and speed of change forces and change catalysts\"; uncertainty—\"[t]he lack of predictability, the prospects for surprise, and the sense of awareness and understanding of issues and events\"; complexity—\"[t]he multiplex of force, the confounding of issues[,] and the chaos and confusion that surround an organization\"; and ambiguity—\"[t]he haziness of reality, the potential for misreads, and the mixed meanings of conditions; cause-and-effect confusion.\"3Pathologists experience all 4 of these environments. Volatility can be found, for example, in the rapidly evolving state of molecular/genetic/personalized/tailored medicine. The political unrest surrounding health care delivery and spending is a prime example of uncertainty in the pathologists' world. Complexity can be found in, for example, the ever-changing and increasing demands on pathology-resident education. Ambiguity is experienced as pathologists attempt to satisfy the varied and diverse demands put upon them, both in the private and the academic spheres. These examples are only the tip of their respective icebergs.Pathologists are used to handling straightforward questions with straightforward answers: Is this lesion cancer? Which chemistry instrument is best for a specific laboratory? What are the criteria for the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis? How should one process breast biopsy tissue? \"Low complexity, fixed targets[,] and 'knowable' problems can be solved with a Command-and-Control approach. Here[,] careful upfront planning and then methodical execution pays dividends.\"4Pathologists are now, however, in the VUCA world, where \"standard Command-and-Control processes are not effective.\"4 \"[P]rojects [and problems] with high complexity, moving targets and initially unclear end-goals cannot be planned in detail upfront and then simply executed.\"4 Those are, however, exactly the issues that arise in the VUCA world of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. \"The frenetic pace of our environment, brought on by volatility, also creates uncertainty, a lack of clarity that hinders our ability to conceptualize the threats and challenges facing the organizations we lead.\"5 It is, therefore, no wonder that pathologists are confused and disgruntled; the methods we have traditionally used to handle problems, which have served us so well, simply no longer suffice. Indeed, the threats themselves may not be discernible.Of course, all this leads to increasing workplace stress on pathologists. \"Workloads… are likely to keep going up. 'Doing more with less' will continue.\"6 \"This is the main driver of workplace stress[,] … combin[ing] workloads, pressure, and time shortages, with uncertainty and chaos, much of it due to organizational change … [and] stress will increase. As decades of stress research has taught us, the more stress, the greater the negative effects.\"6 It is no surprise then that increasingly stressed pathologists in a VUCA world are experiencing frustration, disenchantment, and burnout.What then can pathologists do? \"In general, the premises of VUCA tend to shape [one's] capacity to (1) anticipate the issues that shape conditions, (2) understand the consequences of issues and actions, (3) appreciate the interdependence of variables, (4) prepare for alternative realities and challenges, [and] (5) interpret and address relevant opportunities.\"3 The extent to which pathologists can successfully shape their capacities to handle these challenges will determine their success in the VUCA world. \"[B]eyond viewing threats and opportunities as collective; we must seem them as interactive.\"7 Indeed, in the VUCA world, they are quite literally the same thing.For pathologists to prepare themselves appropriately for the VUCA world, a better understanding of the challenges and possible coping mechanisms of each of the VUCA environments—volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity—is necessary.Volatility is \"… a state of dynamic instability brought about by drastic, violent, and rapid shifts. Problems no longer arise in the distance; they emerge for the first time in our personal space and require immediate attention.\"8 Volatility can be explained as going \"into work with a well-thought-out list of [10] things … to accomplish … [and leaving the] office near midnight, [having] no tasks accomplished and accumulat[ing] 20 additional ones.\"8 \"Volatility can leave us feeling overwhelmed, alone, and utterly unprepared to lead effectively. In business, people's lives may not be on the line, but their livelihoods surely are.\"8 In pathology, people's lives are on the line.There are ways pathologists can transform themselves to more effectively lead in a volatile environment. First, the pathologist must ask the laboratory team \"to translate data into information… [that is, turn raw data into] the right data, selected and meaningfully combined into usable information… .\"8 Second, pathologists need to learn to communicate very clearly. \"Buzz words, catch phrases, and one-liners fall flat in a volatile environment. A great role model is Winston Churchill. A fantastic communicator, he once said 'the small words are best.' Anything [more than 3] syllables didn't make his cut and neither did any statement that was not direct. Save the pithy slogans for your marketing campaign.\"8 Better yet, discard them altogether. Finally, pathologists must ensure that their intent is understood. If fully understood, pathologists will \"be better equipped to appropriately handle violent and unpredicted shifts in the environment.\"8When pathologists' words and actions have clear intent, volatility gives way to vision. \"Vision is much more important than foresight, [because] vision seeks to create a future—not just study the future. With clear vision, creative space opens for innovation within the parameters that you specify. A bold vision sees beyond volatility, with a kind of calm perspective that is not trapped by the assumptions of the present.\"9\"Uncertainty becomes increasingly dangerous when we rush to understand it with an over-reliance on what we've witnessed before.\"5 Nonetheless, pathologists can more-effectively control an uncertain environment. First, pathologists must ensure they have a fresh perspective. \"Find ways to challenge the appropriateness of your mental models, individually and collectively.\"5The concept of red-teaming is helpful. Red-teaming is the use of a devil's advocate within the leadership team to counter the influence of group-think. Red-teamers don't simply shoot holes in a plan; they think and act as the competition requiring leaders to move beyond 'that won't happen' to 'what if this occurs.' The red-team members have no personal investment in the plan, so they don't have problems exposing weaknesses or single points of failure. Red-team membership should be rotated, and leaders must be careful to value and protect red-team members from any perceived backlash from other organizational members.\"5Second, pathologists must be flexible in their planning. \"Detailed plans are great … but when you have a really good plan, it's hard to not be wed to it, especially when you've been involved in its creation. A plan should incorporate flexibility and options at its inception.\"5Finally, pathologists must always look ahead, while only occasionally glancing back. \"[F]ocus on what could realistically be done better in the future, rather than what could have been done in the past… .\"5 \"In uncertain environments, predictability drops, and surprises rise. In such a climate, planning, organizing, and adaptability take on a critical importance… .\"6When pathologists do that, uncertainty will fade, and instead, understanding will prevail. \"In the face of uncertainty, listening and understanding can help leaders discover new ways of thinking and acting. Listening leads to understanding, which is the basis for trust.\"9\"Complexity can leave us frustrated, feeling solely responsible for success or failure, while at the same time feeling alive in the critical moment.\"7 Pathologists can more effectively handle complexity by, first, developing collaborative leaders in a manner that \"see[s] the big picture and… lead[s] their peers to achieve more together than they could individually.\"7 Second, its difficulty notwithstanding, pathologists must stop seeking permanent solutions. Although tempting, \"pursuing permanent solutions might exhaust critical resources needed elsewhere. A resilient yet insignificant threat can easily divert your attention from other more menacing challenges.\"7 Finally, pathologists must train tomorrow's pathology leaders today, putting \"the right resources into their development now.\"7 Pathologists will have to forget about easy solutions. With complexity, \"confusion and chaos become the norm… . This means there are no obvious 'low hanging fruit' solutions that [one] can quickly implement. Instead, [one must] learn new ways to think critically and creatively to solve the dilemmas… .\"6For pathologists, complexity will then transform into clarity. \"Leaders must help others make sense out of complexity. The VUCA world rewards clarity because people are so confused that they grasp at anything that helps them make sense out of the chaos… . Clarity is good, and we should strive for it, but not at the expense of truth. The thoughtful leader's quest is to be both clear and accurate, simple but not simplistic. Clarity is usually possible, even when there is no control.\"9\"Whereas the frustration we experience from volatility, uncertainty, and complexity might leave us feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, ambiguity leads primarily to inefficiency and missed opportunities. Toleration of either will leave us surviving at best… .\"10 Ambiguity \"… is one of the leading causes of conflict… and its second- and third-order effects are capable of dismantling an organization. Two symptoms are frequently associated with ambiguity: the inability to accurately conceptualize threats and opportunities before they become lethal and increasing frustration that compartmentalized accomplishments don't add up to comprehensive or enduring success.\"10 \"Ambiguity doesn't paralyze … [people, but instead] makes them insecure and stirs them up.\"10For pathologists to more effectively lead in an ambiguous environment, they must first listen well, because \"all voices must be heard.10 Second, pathologists will need to think divergently, \"seeing past [one's] own ideas… to care more about a great idea gaining a voice rather than whose voice gets credit.\"10 Finally, pathologists will need to establish incremental dividends. \"Celebrating success is important, especially in an ambiguous environment…. [S]etting and achieving incremental dividends is a great way to build and maintain momentum, confidence[,] and trust… [and it] afford[s] us the opportunity to continually assess our environment from a position of relative control and strength: a true luxury in any environment.\"10 With ambiguity, pathologists must have \"the mental ability to maintain [a] 'line of sight' toward [the] objective. Having a clear and compelling sense of purpose… helps to laser focus on the most pressing priorities.\"6If pathologists are successful, then ambiguity will be replaced by agility. \"In an ambiguous world, leaders must be ready for surprises. Leaders can't surrender to ambiguity—that would lead to paralysis and confusion. Rather, leaders must learn how to be agile and responsive to attack. The VUCA world rewards networks because they are agile, [whereas] it punishes the rigidity and brittleness of hierarchies.\"9In summary, pathologists will have to change dramatically and adapt to the VUCA world. To succeed, pathologists will have to \"retain a clear vision against which judgments can be made, with agility to flex and respond appropriately to rapidly unfolding situations [; p]rovide clear direction and consistent messaging against a backdrop of continually shifting priorities… [; a]nticipate risks but [not] invest too much time in long-term strategic plans… [; and t]hink big picture, [making] decisions based as much on intuition as analysis.\"11Cleverly put, \"the solution for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity is Vision—an intent that seeks to create a clear future state[;] Understanding—stop, look[,] and listen to the characteristics at play; Clarity—make sense of the chaos[; and] Agility—wirearchy (networking) is rewarded over hierarchy\"4 (Table).Future leaders in pathology will clearly \"need to develop leadership capabilities for resilience in themselves and others.\"6 Pathologists will have to \"toughen their change readiness capability to withstand such volatility\"6; and \"be prepared to handle unforeseen workforce events and conditions that literally nobody thought of in advance.\"12 Future pathology leaders will need the virtue of quiet transparency. They will \"need to do the right thing, to be transparent about it, and then to be quiet about it.\"13 Seemingly paradoxically, in a world increasingly media-driven, \"[y]ou need humble strength. You hope somebody else will notice.\"13\"[T]oday's VUCA environment is now a permanent condition.\"12 Pathologists need to be ready to do things that chafe. \"It's going to be a zigzag path. You have to learn how to fail early, fail often, and fail cheaply, as a way of developing your strategy as you go… . [Be] very clear about where you're going, but very flexible in how you get there.\"13Forget about comfort zones. \"Get used to being uncomfortable.\"11 \"Be curious. Uncertain times bring opportunities for bold moves. Seize the chance to innovate.\"11 \"Resist the temptation to cling on to outdated, inadequate processes and behaviors. Take leaps of faith and enjoy the adventure.\"11 As Mark Twain famously wrote, in Eve's Diary, \"If there wasn't anything to find out, it would be dull. Even trying to find out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and finding out; and I don't know but more so.\"14",

However, the cooperation needed to produce public goods is vulnerable to exploitation by free-riders &amp;mdash; the Tragedy of the Commons. The dominant solution to this problem of collective action is that some form of positive assortment (due to kinship or spatial structure) or of enforcement (reward and punishment) is necessary for public-goods cooperation to evolve. However, these solutions are only needed when individual contributions to the public good accrue linearly, and the assumption of linearity is never true in biology. We explain how cooperation for nonlinearpublic goods is maintained endogenously and does not require positive assortment or enforcement, and we review the considerable empirical evidence for the existence and maintenance of nonlinear public goods in biology. We argue that it is time to move beyond discussions about assortment and enforcement in the study of cooperation in biology.",

      "title": "Twelve issues for cognitive science",
      "abstract": "I am struck by how little is known about so much of cognition. One goal of this paper is to argue for the need to consider a rich set of interlocking issues in the study of cognition. Mainstream work in cognition—including my own—ignores many critical aspects of animate cognitive systems. Perhaps one reason that existing theories say so little relevant to real world activities is the neglect of social and cultural factors, of emotion, and of the major points that distinguish an animate cognitive system from an artificial one: the need to survive, to regulate its own operation, to maintain itself, to exist in the environment, to change from a small, uneducated, immature system to an adult, developed, knowledgeable one.\r\n\r\nHuman cognition is not the same as artificial cognition, if only because the human organism must also be concerned with the problems of life, of development, of survival. There must be a regulatory system that interacts with the cognitive component. And it may well be that it is the cognitive component that is subservient, evolved primarily for the benefit of the regulatory system, working through the emotions, through affect.\r\n\r\nI argue that several concepts must become fundamental parts of the study of cognition, including the roles of culture, of social interaction, of emotions, and of motivation. I argue that there are at least 12 issues that should comprise the study of cognition, and thereby, the field of Cognitive Science. We need to study a wide variety of behavior before we can hope to understand a single class. Cognitive scientists as a whole ought to make more use of evidence from the neurosciences, from brain damage and mental illness, from cognitive sociology and anthropology, and from clinical studies of the human. These must be accompanied, of course, with the study of language, of the psychological aspects of human processing structures, and of artificially intelligent mechanisms. The study of Cognitive Science requires a complex interaction among different issues of concern, an interaction that will not be properly understood until all parts are understood, with no part independent of the others, the whole requiring the parts, and the parts the whole.",

      "title": "The comprehension of ‘here’ and ‘there’",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Comprehension of words like here and there demands an ability to take the speaker as reference point whether or not his position agrees with one's own. Because children are known to have difficulty taking another person's viewpoint into account, it was hypothesized that children would be able to understand here and there with the speaker as reference point only after they were able to understand the terms with self as reference point. Fifty children age 2;6–3;6 were presented with two toys spaced a few feet apart and asked ‘Which one is over here/there?’ There were three conditions: E and S both sat next to (1) the same toy; (2) a different toy; and (3) E sat next to one toy while the other toy was near no-one. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was found that children did not comprehend the words with self as reference point first. Instead, the words appear to be understood first I with respect to an inconsistent reference point before children learn that the reference point is always the speaker.",

      "title": "Type Like a Man! Inferring Gender from Keystroke Dynamics in Live-Chats",
      "abstract": "Nonverbal communication is often referred to as body language, an expression that accounts for the major role that the body plays in interaction, especially when it comes to conveying socially and psychologically relevant information. Such a role is the result of a long evolutionary process that has shaped the brain to be sensitive to the signals sent by co -located others more than to any other signal in the environment (e.g., the human voice is one of the sounds that requires the lowest energy to be heard). Still, despite such an evolutionary history, people communicate increasingly more frequently through technologies that prevent, partially or totally, the use of nonverbal behavior. For example, phones allow one to use nonverbal vocal behavior (laughter, sobbing, intonation, pauses, etc.), but not facial expressions or gestures. In the context outlined above, it is important to investigate whether body language is still possible when the body cannot play its role. For this reason, this article has shown that there is a significant interplay between gender and keystroke dynamics at least in the case of interactions taking place through live -chat interfaces. In particular, the experiments have shown that it is possible to infer the gender of a person from her typing behavior with an accuracy higher than 95%. In addition, the experiments have shown that such a performance relies mostly on features (physical and machine detectable measures extracted through a key -logging platform) that account for implicit and explicit expression of affect, social presence, and planning problems. According to a recent survey, 36% of adults owning a smartphone use messaging systems (https://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/mobilemessaging-and-social-media-2015D. In addition, The market for technologies supporting live -chats is expected to 40 50 60 grow with an average rate of 7.3% until 2023 when it is expected to reach a total volume close to one billion dollars per year (https://",

      "title": "27 Styles in Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Defense and coping are important for the perception of reality and for dealing with internal conflicts and with everyday problems. How do we react to unwanted events, to unacceptable wishes, to threatening situations and feelings, and how can we deal with problems without explicit system of coping and defense mechanisms? Defensive operations are-first of all -protective processes that exert control over the interaction between the internal and external world. Social and cultural effects are always inter­ twined with incompatible ideas. Whether we consider defense mechan­ isms to be functions of the mind (like memory or consciousness) or adopt a dynamic energy concept of defense or conceive of it as part of the ego organization, socialization constitutes one of the most import determinants for the development of defense mechanisms and defense organization. Specifically, defenses have been accorded a central role in the currently prominent and intrinsically important category of eating disorders. Eating disorders occur at the rate of 1000: 1 in women and men, respectively. Consequently, we have to look at gender issues. In the literature, defense and coping are typically discussed without reference to gender. In the classical description of defense mechanisms (Freud, 1936), they are viewed as an attempt to repress incompatible idea ... which has come into distressing opposition with one's ego. Haan (1963) described coping processes as actions by the ego that serve to coordinate the person's social, moral, and cognitive structures depending on the situation (cf. Gitzinger, 1988). Gender issues, however, were not expli­ citly taken into account by Haan either.",

      "abstract": "Richard Power’s novel Galatea 2.2 presents the task and prospect of Artificial Intelligence’s language although the novel is based on story-telling and the author’s imagination. In particular, it is worth to note not only terms of address and terms of reference but also terms of body concerning Artificial Intelligence Helen. She is mostly addressed by her first name (Helen) and other terms such as machine, apparatus, bag of networks, fancy tin-can telephone, distributed process, multidimentional shape, etc. Also, Artificial Intelligence Helen is a symbol of A (a twenty-two year old woman and post-graduate student) and imitating A, some terms like ‘a gifted cockatiel’ and ‘twin’ are used for Helen in terms of reference. In comparison, Rick is addressed in various ways, that is first name, surname, affectionate names and other nicknames. In addition, Artificial Intelligence Helen has no nose, mouth or fingers and only she has partially functioning eyes and ears. Thus Helen is not able to fully understand metaphorical language expressions concerning emotion. For instance, in some expressions like ‘your stomach in knots’, ‘embarrasment shrinks you’, or ‘amazement strikes you dead’. Helen could not feel the meanings and thus she has a lack of knowledge in similar linguistic circumstances. Lastly, Artificial Intelligence Helen is Imp. H. It means that Helen has been evolved from Imp. A, Imp. B, Imp. C, and so on. So the shut down of herself in the novel suggests and hints at the revival of a new version of Artificial Intelligence may be named “Galatea 3.3”.",

Many ethical questions and answers in religious or theological discussions are based on the view that someone has on the essence of sin. Ethical questions are always burning issues, while the essence of sin is a more theoretical and less favourite topic. The question addressed in this article is whether the essence of sin is found in our actions, our relationships or our condition as sinners. It is argued that our deranged actions and relationships are mere symptoms of our deranged condition. Just as cancer, death, trauma, sinful deeds and relationships, this condition did not change after Christ's redemption. Christ's redemption saved us from the power of sin, but the sinful condition, actions and relationship will only be rectified to the full with his second coming. Therefore, as all of us are still caught in this condition, we need to have more empathy for one another. We need to know that although we do not have someone else?s symptoms, we do have the same condition with only other symptoms.",

The medical humanities are no exception. If it were to be distilled into only a few sentences, the foundation story of the medical humanities would go something like this: During the twentieth century, biomedicine lost its way: the art and humanity of medical practice were lost to rapid scientific advances and new technologies.

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>There is a difference between the activities of two or more individuals that are performed jointly such as playing music in a band or dancing as a couple, and performing these same activities alone. This difference is sometimes captured by appealing to shared or joint intentions that allow individuals to coordinate what they do over space and time. In what follows we will use the terminology of we-intentionality to refer to what individuals do when they engage in group ways of thinking, feeling and acting. Our aim in this paper is to argue that we-intentionality is best understood in relation to a shared living environment in which acting individuals are situated. By the “living environment” we mean to refer to places and everyday situations in which humans act. These places and situations are simultaneously social, cultural, material and natural. We will use the term “affordance” to refer to the possibilities for action the living environment furnishes. Affordances form and are maintained over time through the activities people repeatedly engage in the living environment. We will show how we-intentionality is best understood in relation to the affordances of the living environmentand by taking into account the skills people have to engage with these affordances. For this reason we coin the term ‘skilled we-intentionality’ to characterize the intentionality characteristic of group ways of acting, feeling and thinking.</ns4:p>",

      "abstract": "Education fails in its purpose if it leaves untouched the basic values held by the student. By this I mean his ethical sense, his powers of intellectual analysis, his capacity for emotional reactions, his spiritual life. These lie close to the fundament of his character, and few means of communication reach them so effectively as do the fine arts. When the experience of a work of art takes place at the fullest potential of its power, when it involves the mans rational faculties as well as his intuitive, wordless reactions to the eloquence of form, then his capacities to feel and understand are expanded, he learns to transcend his limited self. To insist that aesthetic experience is a central issue in any discussion of the humanities may be restating what is obvious to everyone; but I honestly fear that too often what is commonly accepted becomes commonplace and is thus neglected. Moreover, scholars frequently hesitate to discuss matters that seem to verge on the irrational, and we generally recognize that the experience of a work of art is almost totally subjective. The quality of this event, its intensity and duration, are difficult to measure or to compare with analogous moments?the feeling of fulfillment of a chemist as he perfects a complex synthetic compound, the ex ultation of a victorious athlete, or the mood of a fisherman sitting silently along the banks of a river at dusk. I am concerned here less with the problems and insights of the creative artist, whether ancient or modern, and more with the reaction of his audience who are far more numerous. The mo ment when any man among them becomes enthralled with a work of art, the moment of true and private revelation, becomes one of the important events of his biography?the night he at tended a performance of Shaw's Saint Joan or The Marriage of Figaro, the afternoon he walked about the Church of St. Pierre 837",

Scientific Approach * Our ability to time-bind is most evident when we apply a scientific approach, method or attitude in our evaluations and judgments. * A scientific approach involves the process of continually testing assumptions and beliefs, gathering as many facts and as much data as possible, revising assumptions and beliefs as appropriate, and holding conclusions and judgments tentatively. * Hidden, or unstated assumptions guide our behavior to some degree; therefore we ought to make a special effort to become more aware of them. * We live in a process-oriented universe in which everything changes all the time. The changes may be readily apparent to us, or microscopic, or even submicroscopic. There's always more than we can sense or experience. Observe [right arrow] Hypothesize [right arrow] Test [right arrow] Revise, etc. Abstracting and Evaluating (Behavior Awareness) * As human organisms, we have limits as to what we can experience through our senses.

We 'abstract' only a portion of what's 'out there.' * Our awareness of 'what goes on' outside of our skin, is not 'what is going on;' our awareness of our experience is not the silent, first-order, neurological experience. * Given our ever-changing environment (which includes ourselves, and our awareness of ourselves), we never experience the 'same' person, event, situation, 'thing,' experience, etc., more than once. * To the degree that our reactions and responses to all forms of stimuli are automatic, or conditioned, we copy animals, like Pavlov's dog. To the degree that our reactions and responses are more controlled, delayed, or conditional to the given situation, we exhibit our uniquely-human capabilities. * We each experience 'what's out there' uniquely, according to our individual sensory capabilities, integrating our past experiences and expectations. …",

      "abstract": "A useful starting point for this chapter is a quotation from Abercrombie1 in which he reminds us that 'We speak with our vocal organs, but we converse with our whole body.' Characteristically, we think of the process of communicating in terms of what we say. Did we speak with sufficiently authority? Was some complex issue clarified? Was a choice of topic ill judged? Could a word have been misconstrued? In short, we are inclined to focus upon verbal communication, upon words used and their sequencing and structure. Messages relayed in other ways while we speak, through glances, gestures, facial expressions, posture, tone of voice and dress, will most probably completely escape our attention. Yet it is often such nonverbal communication (NVC) that proves decisive in conveying information and forming judgements about others. The significance of this point is no less relevant in the workplace. While affirming the key role played generally by what he calls this 'silent language', Fletcher2 continued by asserting that: … nowhere is this more true than in management, where we are often uncertain about whether we have understood each other fully — and need every clue we can get to help us ensure we are sending and receiving messages accurately.",

We assume that mental representations have a structure not wholly unlike that of a sentence, and combine elements from a mental repertoire not wholly unlike a lexicon. These elements are mental concepts: so to speak, 'words of Mentalese'. Mental concepts are relatively stable and distinct structures in the mind, comparable to entries in an encyclopaedia or to permanent files in a data-base. Their occurrence in a mental representation may determine matching causal and formal (semantic or logical) relationships. On the one hand, there are relationships between the mind and the world. The activation of a concept may play a major role in causal interactions between the organism and external objects that fall under that concept. On the other hand, there are relationships among representations within the mind. The occurrence of a concept in a mental representation may play a causal role in the derivation of further representations, and may also contribute to the justification of this derivation.",

From the third-person view, volitional behaviour is internally generated, rather than being determined by the immediate environmental context, and is therefore, to some extent, unpredictable. Such behaviour is not unique to humans, since it is seen in many other species including invertebrates. From the first-person view, our experience of volitional behaviour includes a vivid sense of agency. We feel that, through our intentions, we can cause things to happen and we can choose between different actions. Our experience of agency is not direct. It depends on sub-personal inferences derived from prior expectations and sensations associated with movement. As a result, our experiences and intuitions about volition can be unreliable and uncertain. Nevertheless, our experience of agency is not a mere epiphenomenon. Anticipation of the regret we might feel after making the wrong choice can alter behaviour. Furthermore, the strong sense of responsibility, associated with agency, has a critical role in creating social cohesion and group benefits. We can only study the experience of agency in humans who can describe their experiences. The discussion of the experience of volition, that introspection and communication make possible, can change our experience of volitional actions. As a result, agency, regret and responsibility are cultural phenomena that are unique to humans.",

      "title": "Self-harm and suicide",
      "abstract": "A person may redress a wrong by harming the transgressor, or by harming someone with whom the transgressor has a vital CS relationship. Suicide and self-harm take both forms, sometimes simultaneously. Thus, Annie may kill herself because she has violated a relationship that only her self-punishment can redeem, or she may kill herself to punish Bill who has transgressed against her, but who loves her and will suffer when she kills herself. In either case there are often important metarelational motives at work. Hurting or killing oneself may restore the collective honor of one’s primary CS group, such as family or military unit. Suicide and self-harm may also show that one accepts full individual responsibility for failure, so third parties should not blame anyone else. In other metarelational processes, Annie’s suicide to punish Bill’s transgression against Annie may make George, who loves Annie, hate Bill, or at the very least shame Bill by drawing George’s and others’ attention to the gravity of Bill’s transgression against Annie. Similarly, like Lucretia’s suicide after being raped by Sextus, it may spur others to avenge a grave transgression. More recently, Tibetan monks’ suicide by setting themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule over Tibet and repression of Buddhism have put great moral pressure on China, and in 2010 Mohammed Bouazizi’s suicide by fire in Tunisia brought out masses of protestors who overthrew the government.",

We can always be conscious of how happy, sad, annoyed, or anxious we feel, and also of the feelings we have relative to other persons: pride, envy, guilt, jealousy, trust, respect, or resentment. Developments in brain imaging and in capturing nuances of nonverbal display now enable the objective study of emotion and how biologically based primary emotions relate to higher-level social, cognitive, and moral emotions. This book presents an integrated developmental-interactionist theory of emotion, viewing subjective feelings as voices of the genes: an affective symphony composed of dissociable albeit interactive neurochemical modules. These primordial voices do not control, but rather cajole our behavior with built-in flexibility enabling the mindful application of learning, reason, and language.",

It need not correlate with the reality to an external observer of physical or psychological disability. Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history. Accurate perception and evaluation, having been interdicted during childhood, is avoided with the magical hope that thereby one will be acceptable and what is wrong will disappear. The interaction between self and parents, real and fantasied, cannot be clearly known. The patient remains uncertain as to what is wrong, in whom it is located, and how it has come about. The sense of defect, physical or psychological, becomes the nidus around which much is crystallized. This is then offered up to a parent (and the superego) as an appeasement and seduction, aiming to help this parent feel better by agreeing that the child is indeed the cause of what is wrong. Dangerously destructive (and sexual) wishes are defended against and atoned for by emphasis on one's defectiveness.",

How do they learn the meanings of verbs like \"think,\" adjectives like \"good,\" and words for abstract entities such as \"mortgage\" and \"story\"? The acquisition of word meaning is one of the fundamental issues in the study of mind. According to Paul Bloom, children learn words through sophisticated cognitive abilities that exist for other purposes. These include the ability to infer others' intentions, the ability to acquire concepts, an appreciation of syntactic structure, and certain general learning and memory abilities. Although other researchers have associated word learning with some of these capacities, Bloom is the first to show how a complete explanation requires all of them. The acquisition of even simple nouns requires rich conceptual, social, and linguistic capacities interacting in complex ways. This book requires no background in psychology or linguistics and is written in a clear, engaging style. Topics include the effects of language on spatial reasoning, the origin of essentialist beliefs, and the young child's understanding of representational art. The book should appeal to general readers interested in language and cognition as well as to researchers in the field. Bradford Books imprint",

Nor can they be clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter under the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather more distinct in its nature, and refers to something revolting, primarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. Nevertheless, extreme contempt, or, as it is often called, loathing contempt, hardly differs from disgust. These several conditions of the mind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of expression, and others on a different mode. From this circumstance M. Lemoine has argued that their descriptions are not trustworthy. But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the principle of association, for their expression.",

To acquaintances, it also has two subtypes; one is reciprocal altruism, which is to get more returns in a short period of time; the other is nonreciprocal altruism, which is the focus of this paper. Due to nonreciprocity, it is true altruism; it emerges when a seriously sick (and penniless) acquaintance would starve to death; it evolves due directly to human motivation not to be bottom among acquaintances; it benefits all acquaintances as long as one of them mutates to be altruistic; it is of great significance to human growth; it leads into an altruistic mechanism which makes capable persons altruistic together to incapable ones.",

Because we are social creatures, dependent, and not simply self-made, we are responsible for aspects of our identities that have been given to us. We may be more responsible for what we choose, but we can be at least minimally responsible for what we do not voluntarily control, but nevertheless believe or desire, when we are not malfunctioning (for instance: we are reason-responsive). This claim is developed by considering how we should think about responsibility and blame in cases of autism, antisocial personality disorder, kleptomania, and schizophrenia.

There has been considerable controversy as to whether an uncertainty response is really the same as Cartesian \"doubt.\" Smith was the first researcher to systematically investigate metacognition in animals, and his and his colleagues' provocative experiments remain seminal in this endeavor. Humans can often respond intelligently in difficult situations by pausing, reflecting, and seeking help, hints, or information. These states of feeling and knowing and these adoptive coping responses anchor the extensive literatures on metacognition. There are structural similarities in the information-processing situations that humans and animals face. Animals will encounter difficult situations in which their well-learned associations and automatic behavioral patterns cannot help them. Animals have faced the same immediate need to rethink their situation in many comparative paradigms.",

In addition, our specialty often functions as a chaotic/emergent system since the initial circumstances vary in patients with the same medical condition resulting in uncertainty and lack of predictability [1]. Complexity: The American Heritage Dictionary defines complex and complicated as “things whose parts are so interconnected or interwoven as to make the whole perplexing”. If we add rarity and small numbers to complexity, the results is a distinctiveness that explains many aspects of our profession and specialty such as variability with institutional differences in outcomes; inconsistency of results in treating rare diseases and uncertainty on any inference about results of complex rare lesions [2]. A system is a set of interdependent elements that are interacting, or working together, to accomplish a common goal. All systems, at the “atomic” level, consist of individuals, activities, connections, and pathways with the following characteristics, qualities or peculiarities in complex systems: • Heterogeneity of the parties (diverse nature and multiple); • Cause-and-effect relationships may be nonlinear and obvious only in retrospect; • Richness of interaction between them (including their contradictory character); • Multidimensional and multi-referential; • Many variables commonly present; • Provide information that by itself reveals the extent of its complexity; • Under an apparent simplicity, they often hide the true dynamics of these processes and interactions between its parts • Vulnerability — Are influenced by factors and surprising circumstances that may affect, cause, or facilitate a change in behavior and expected results, altering all or changed significantly “Complex business generates complex services.

      "abstract": "Extract The Reflexive Constraint Following Shoemaker, I imagined the alternative modes of 'quasi‐perception' and 'quasi‐memory', which are like perception and memory, save for the fact that the content of the state need not concern the person in the state. In quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory, it may not be the person in the experiential state, but some other person, who is R‐related to what the state represents. Like Evans, I emphasized how dissimilar quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory are from ordinary perception and ordinary memory. Their 'semantics', as I put it, is different. Perception and memory obey what we may call the Reflexive Constraint: if the state is veridical, the person undergoing it must be R‐related to what it represents. The Reflexive Constraint does not apply to quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory. Now quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory are counterfactual modes—modes of experience that do not actually exist—but we have just seen that, among the existing modes, one is similar to quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory in that it does not obey the Reflexive Constraint. That mode is the imagination. The person in whose situation the imagined state of affairs is supposed to hold need not be the imaginer himself; it may be anybody, including Napoleon, or the last man to be alive on Earth. The imaginer 'sees' the world vicariously, through the eyes of his imaginative target, just as the quasi‐rememberer vicariously 'remembers' the experiences of another person.",

      "abstract": "The concept of \"successful aging\" as coined by Rowe and Kahan in the late nineties of the last century, came to describe a period of old age with multi-functional abilities. The functions are physical, cognitive and social, without progressive chronic diseases and without disabilities. There is a change in the concept of successful aging beyond the physical dimension (daily function (ADL) and cognitive function) which is based on objective performance indicators towards subjective indicators based on the patients' feelings and their quality of life. Successful aging moves from the limited bio-physical aspect to an overall view of bio-psycho-socio which means mental-emotional-behavioral aspects, social involvement, and also an element of spirituality and even end-of-life decisions. Successful aging will be measured by objective and subjective measures that include the patient's feelings and experiences. The idea is to include and see in successful aging not only the absence of morbidity and disability as seen by Rowe and Kahan, but to a multidimensional function that includes physical and cognitive, mental and emotional, social and spiritual parameters and a dimension of the end of life in making decisions according to the wishes and preferences of the person himself and his family.",

      "abstract": "Human consciousness serves many roles. It helps us imagine, dream, and think rationally. One capacity that human consciousness enables is cooperation. Here, we will focus on the interplay between cooperation and how subjects understand the minds of others. The aim is to compare and elucidate the similarities and differences between humans and apes as concerns cooperative behaviour. One difference can be described with the two terms ‘competitive cooperation’ and ‘collaborative cooperation’. Apes cooperate in competitive contexts, where the resource is available and accessible, but not yet in possession. Humans can as well cooperate in order to achieve something that is not manifest, but mainly desirable. Humans can imagine what is not there, and make their imaginations known to each other. Another difference is that apes cannot represent the goal without the means to reach them. Humans, on the contrary, can reflect about different ways of reaching the goal. Language gives human beings a great advantage in cooperative behaviour, especially in communication about goals and the way to reach them. Another aspect to the difference between humans and apes that concerns a more basic capacity than language-use is joint attention. It is necessary for cooperation for it to be possible for different subjects to attend to a common goal. Apes can engage in joint attention, but do not achieve the same complexity of joint attention as humans. For one thing, they can jointly attend only to things that are present in the context. This makes it difficult to cooperate in order to achieve a goal that is not present or implicated in the immediate environment. An application of our analysis of different kinds of cooperation is game theory. However, cooperative and non-cooperative games, considered in the traditional theory, are only the extremes of the possible levels of cooperation. By taking into account different levels of joint attention and communication, a more fine-grained analysis of different kinds of cooperation in game theory is possible. (Less)",

      "title": "Beauty, the feeling",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Many philosophers and psychologists have made claims about the feelings in an experience of beauty. Here, we test how well these claims match the feelings that people report while looking at an image or listening to music that is beautiful to them, or recalling a personal experience of beauty. We conducted ten experiments (total n = 851) spanning three nations (US, UK, and India). Across nations and modalities, we find that top-rated beauty experiences are strongly characterized by six dimensions: intense pleasure, an impression of universality, the wish to continue the experience, perceived harmony in variety, exceeding expectation, and meaningfulness. Other frequently proposed beauty characteristics — like surprise, desire to understand, and mind wandering — are uncorrelated with feeling beauty. When explicitly asked, participants in all countries report that beauty is closely related to pleasure, found in nature rather than art, influenced by mood, and a form of communication. A remembered beautiful experience was typically active and social, like a family holiday, quite unlike the passive solitary appraisal of art emphasized in aesthetics. Our data align well with Kant (r = 0.74) and psychological theories that emphasize pleasure, and reject theories that emphasize information seeking. These six dimensions characterizing how individuals feel beauty emerge from the reports of hundreds of people seeing, hearing, or remembering something beautiful to them.",

      "title": "Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) use human and conspecific social cues to locate hidden food.",
      "abstract": "Ten domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) of different breeds and ages were exposed to 2 different social cues indicating the location of hidden food, each provided by both a human and a conspecific (for a total of 4 different social cues). For the local enhancement cue, the approached the location where food was hidden and then stayed beside it. For the gaze and point cue, the stood equidistant between 2 hiding locations and bodily oriented and gazed toward the 1 in which food was hidden (the human also pointed). Eight of the 10 subjects, including the one 6-month-old juvenile, were above chance with 2 or more cues. Results are discussed in terms of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic processes by means of which dogs come to use social cues to locate food. The use of social cues to locate food and other important entities in the environment is a skill with obvious adaptive benefits. For example, an informant may look toward an entity, and this look may be accompanied by both head and body orientation to the same location and sometimes by other behaviors such as vocalizations or travel toward the target location. The ability of observer individuals to exploit social cues of this type enables them to benefit from knowledge possessed only by specific groupmates. Despite the potential importance of this social ability for the foraging of many highly social species such as mammals, there has been very little systematic research in this area. Virtually all of the relevant research has been conducted with nonhuman primates and their skills of gaze following. There are two basic experimental paradigms, and these have produced different sets of results. The first paradigm is simple gaze following in which 1 individual orients its head and eyes in a certain direction (sometimes accompanied by gestures), and another individual either does or does not orient itself similarly. For example, Itakura (1996) had a human approach nonhuman primate individuals and either look or look and manually point to the right or left. Many of the 11 different nonhuman primate species tested visually tracked the pointing gesture, but only 1 (an orangutan) visually followed gaze direction by itself. Using a similar methodology, Povinelli and Eddy (1996a) also found positive results for 6 juvenile chimpanzees following the gaze of",

      "title": "Event parsing and the origins of grammar",
      "abstract": "How did grammar evolve? Perhaps a better way to ask the question is what kind of cognition is needed to enable grammar. The present analysis departs from the observation that linguistic communication is structured in terms of agents and patients, a reflection of how humans see the world. One way to explore the origins of cognitive skills in humans is to compare them with primates. A first approach has been to teach great apes linguistic systems to study their production in subsequent conversations. This literature has revealed considerable semantic competences in great apes, but no evidence for a corresponding grammatical ability, at least in production. No ape has ever created a sentence with an underlying causal structure of agency and patienthood. A second approach has been to study natural communication in primates and other animals. Here, there is intermittent evidence of compositionality, for example, a capacity to perform operations on semantic units, but again no evidence for an ability to refer to the causal structure of events. Future research will have to decide whether primates and other animals are simply unable to see the world as casually structured the way humans do, or whether they are just unable to communicate causal structures to others.

There is the simple but often searing fact of separation from a loved one; the realization that he or she will no longer enjoy the fruits of life; the suddenness with which death strikes. There can be fear for one's own life, and fear of the power of death in general. There may be anger, directed diffusely at the deceased, or at the persons or powers held responsible. Finally, there are various strong reactions to the corpse itself.",

      "abstract": "A crucial issue posed for the understanding of human cognition, and indeed human evolution more generally, is how what Peirce called symbols emerged in the natural world. Unlike the iconic and indexical forms of semiosis that sustain the organization of life throughout the biological world, symbols are not inherently meaningful, but instead are lodged within communities of interacting actors who recognize them through rule, habit, or convention. No other animal pervasively uses symbols to organize action and shape understanding. The action-relevant importance of symbols is demonstrated by the attempts of an aphasic man to organize the subsequent actions of others with iconic and indexical signs alone. Movement to a next action is systematically delayed by the task of establishing what, of many possibilities, these signs mean now. This does not occur with symbols. Co-operative action thus provides an environment that would both promote and sustain the emergence of symbols by making powerful new forms of rapid, flexible action possible. Indeed, symbols, which sit at the center of human language, are themselves forms of co-operative action. Co-operative action is contrasted with modal, gesture-first theories for the origins of language.",

Is the subject of the infinitives “you” or “we” or both together? Should we understand the SMM-elements in these two infinitives as meaning “together”, or must we suply (with) “Christ”? How is the unusual sequence (first to die!) of the infinitives to be explained? Why is there a change of tense: from aorist to present? And what kind of death and life is referred to? The expression is the equivalent of a purpose (or consecutive) clause. Both the context 6,11–13 and 7,2–4 and the fact that the infinitives have no object point in favor of the assumption that “we and you (together)” is the subject. No object need be supplied here, neither “us” nor “you”, but also not “Christ” (against G. Stahlin). The expression goes back to the language of love, friendship and service. As such, it certainly emphasizes the reality and intensity of Paul's love for the Corinthians. But Paul has ...",

No diseases present such an infinite variety of light and shade belonging to their own nature, or to their intermixture with other maladies, or to the influence of temperament, of individual peculiarities of habit, or of social position; and therefore the diagnosis of no other class of diseases taxes nearly so much the ingenuity and the patience of the physician. The Diagnosis of almost all other diseases depends principally upon weighing the evidence afforded by physical signs and symptoms, upon evidence addressed to the senses; but in mental disease, it is for the most part dependent upon evidence which is cognizable by the intellect alone, and upon data which the senses furnish to us only at second hand. The physician is compelled to bring to this investigation, not only a knowledge of those functions which are subservient to the vegetative and animal life of the individual, but also a clear and analytical conception of those which collectively constitute mind. He must not only be a physician, but a metaphysician; not indeed in the almost opprobrious sense of the term, but in that better sense which designates a lover of truth, seeking to ascertain not the essence of mind or any other unattainable abstraction, but the laws of mind which are as regular as any other natural laws, and the knowledge of which offers to philosophy a wholesome and legitimate object of research.",

From a previous article, I continue here an effort to spell out how the feeling aspect and a cognitive aspect—which, too, was proposed to characterize all pulses of mentality—belong together to a single integral whole. Every state of consciousness is both a feeling and a mental apprehension of something, or at least as though of something. Although states of consciousness vary in veridicality, no state of consciousness is more or less cognitive than any other. Nor is any state of consciousness more abstract, less finite, than any another, less of a concrete feeling. Even an awareness of something universal or general is a “perfectly determinate, singular, and transient thing. … a perishing segment of thought's stream, consubstantial with other facts of sensibility.” The feeling aspect is the experiential, qualitative way in which—or form by which—a state of consciousness feels the totality of items, properties, events, relations, and so on, that it apprehends or seems to apprehend.",

He is concerned to assess the conditions under which a) an action and b) a state of character can be called voluntary or involuntary. And he wants to make the important point that only voluntary actions and voluntarily acquired states of character are praiseworthy or blameworthy and that men can be held responsible only for these kinds of actions and states of character. In this discussion I am only concerned with Aristotle's views concerning one of the conditions under which men can be held responsible for their states of character although this has implications for his analysis of the nature of human action and the relation of knowledge to the virtues. If, under some conditions at least, men can be held responsible for their states of character, some related questions arise. Is it possible to act contrary to an established state of character? Is it possible to form contrary states of character by performing actions contrary to an established state of character? Is, for example, the habitual coward doomed to live out his state of character or is moral reform possible? In the opening lines of Book II, Aristotle implies that character change is possible.

      "abstract": "Teaching respect: a philosophical analysis According to a Zulu proverb a human being can only become truly human because of others. Each person can only become more human, more him self- regardless of his sex - through the co-involvement of others. It is the love for one’s neighbour and the respect one has for him/her as a person which makes one consider the other party's feelings, viewpoints and circumstances. In order to arrive at a situation of peaceful coexistence it is important to realize that human attitudes and a mature life style evolve through a process of learning and interaction with others. It is a time­ consuming and costly process which starts at infancy and continues throughout someone's life. Instruction concerning interpersonal relations and the teaching of respect cannot be confined to individual lessons or working sessions at home or in school. Discussions and conversations concerning interpersonal relations need to form an integral and natural part of a child’s life within the home environment and throughout the pupil's school career. It is senseless if educators talk about the importance of teaching respect only to reveal disrespectful behaviour themselves, or to talk about the importance of self-esteem in the paying of respect whilst causing children to feel negative about themselves. To be able to express respect to other human beings, one needs to be respected. A child needs to experience how it feels when homage is paid. The following rule of life applies in this regard: one can never give if one has never received respect.",

To spark joy generally referenced a positive emotion, though it was more specific for, lyrical, and ingrained in daily life for those from Japan, and it was tied more often to past memories for those from the U.S. For both groups, but particularly for those from the U.S., objects that sparked joy were likely to be seen as indispensable and, to a lesser extent, irreplaceable, reflecting an attachment to such objects. The objects that sparked joy typically had relational and/or self-expression meanings. Overall, the semiotic value of objects that spark joy has two sides: a combination of positive feeling and connection to self and/or other; given the owner's belief that the objects are indispensable, however, they may also fear their loss.",

      "title": "The Phenomenon of Aggressive Behavior of Learners in the School Situation.",
      "abstract": "Aggression is an internal process of human being in relationship with his/her self, other persons and the environment. The external manifestations of aggression, whether constructive or destructive, are not the starting point of aggression. Aggression develops from childhood and continues into adulthood. In this regard Chamberlain (2000:1-4) even states that aggression can develop from before birth. Aggression starts within the psychological world of the individual. The way in which the individual interprets his/her perception will elicit an emotional response that will affect the person's decision on what to do with his/her interpretation of the world. What matters is the way it is expressed-either constructive or destructive behaviour. Aggression is expressed in a constructive manner if it is about the survival and personal and healthy growth of the individual, family, group and/or the community. Aggression is expressed in destructive manner if it harms self and/or others and/or the environment (Tesser, 1995:383-418). According to Kruger, Rech and Van Staden (1993:9) aggression can viewed as any type of behaviour that is directed to harm, hurt, inflict pain or destroy another person when this person is motivated to avoid such behaviour. Aggression can also be self-directed-consciously or unconsciously (self-critical, self-harm, verbal threats and assault). Psycho-social factors that contributes towards aggressive behaviour include inability to cope with frustration; uncomfortable livelihood; exposure to aggressive models such as violence in the media and parents with aggressive behaviour; poor socio-economic circumstances especially in urbanized areas; poor family relationships; times of social stress (such as high inflation rate and increasing divorce statistics), and rejection by peers (Pepler & Sedighdeilami, 1998:205-214; Collings, 1994:35-37; Pulkkinen & Ramirez, 1991:69; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993:9-10). Situational factors can contribute towards aggressive behaviour including competitive sports, physical pain, anxiety, being in a crowed; and air and noise pollution (Smith & Furlong: 1998, 2021-202; Kruger & Van Staden, 1993:10). Biological factors contributing to aggression include constitutional factors (a person's temperament); genetics; hormonal factors; neuro-anatomical factors such as neurotransmission and neuro-logical disturbances (Mooij: 374; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10-11). The self-determination theory state that the motivational orientation have been linked to how individuals regulate self-esteem in other potentially threatening contexts and social interactions (Hodgens, Koestner, & Duncan, 1996; Hodgins, Liebeskind, & Schartz, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). Further, Deci and Ryan (1991) stated that when self-regulation proceeds according to an unintegrated aspect of the person, as with the ego involvement on controlled behaviour, the experienced emotion will be less flexible, more pressured, and more subjective to defensive reaction that less fully express one's integrated self. Investigators have operational zed self -determination in various ways, including the aspiration that individuals endorse (Kasser & Ryan, 1993, 1996), coercive elements of the social context (Deci, Spiegel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kauffmann, 1982; Ryan, Mims, & Koestner, 1983), self-reported reasons for engaging in various behaviours (Vallerand & Bissonette, 1992; Vallerand, Blais, Briere & Pelletier, 1989), and individual differences in motivational orientations (Deci & Ryan, 1985a; Hodgins, Liebeskind, et al, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). This latter work on motivational orientations evolve from the assumption that people differ in the extent to which they regulate their behaviour based on autonomy and choice, or based on pressure (either real or imagined; Deci & Ryan, 1985a). Same-level or cross--level processes (interaction) may exist. …",

      "title": "Influence of adverse environmental factors on the personal structure of a person",
      "abstract": "This article discusses the issues that allow us to say that the psychological consequences after nuclear weapons tests form a typical model of personality. It was characterized by long-term distress, which is manifested mainly by somatic complaints. This model takes on a chronic form. In individuals under conditions of radio-ecological stress, psychological protective mechanisms were violated and states of despair, depression, and confusion arose. Their systems of interpersonal relationships were violated, there was a narrowing of the sphere of vital interests and reduction of adaptive capacity. An analysis of the literature data devoted to the study of the effect of ionizing radiation on the psychological characteristics of the personality as a whole showed that under the influence of adverse environmental factors changes in the personality structure occur and the following personality characteristics appear, such as anxiety, aggression, rigidity, which in turn violate adaptation human life. Damaging factors affect people not so much at once, but for a long time. Some authors believe that mental disorders that occur after an environmental radiation disaster are formed not only due to&nbsp;the direct or indirect action of physical factors, but also as a result of the inclusion of somatopsychic or psychosomatic mechanisms directly related to the impact of the disaster. Key words: adverse environmental factors, anxiety, psycho-emotional stress, socio-psychological tension, depression, environmental consciousness.",

      "title": "Emotional Maturity and Loneliness as Correlates of Life Satisfaction among Adolescents",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emotions which are considered as a basic factor of all relationships 1are very powerful and to a very great extent they control our behaviour, thoughts and all other aspects of life. The behaviour and thought processes are directly influenced by the past experiences and early developmental stages. Emotion is the feeling aspect of consciousness characterized by a physical aspect like physical arousal, behaviours that reveal emotion to the outside world, and an inner awareness of feelings. Healthy emotions motivate us and give us energy for appropriate action. Unhealthy emotions are either overly intense or suppressed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Smiston in 1974 defined “Emotional maturity is a process in which the personality is continuously striving for greater sense of emotional health, both intra-physically and intra-personally” (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990). Kaplan and Baron describes a emotionally mature person as having the capacity to withstand delay in satisfaction of needs, ability to tolerate a reasonable amount of frustration, has belief in long-term planning and is capable of delaying or revising expectations in terms of demands of situation, has capacity to make effective adjustment with themselves, members of family, his peers in the school, society and culture. Maturity is not only the capacity for these attitudes and functioning but also it is the ability to enjoy them fully (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990). According to Hollingworth (1928) an emotionally mature person will be capable of responding in gradation or degree of emotional responses, he does not respond in all or none fashion, but keeps within bounds. He will be able to delay his responses as controlled with the impulsiveness of young child. And he will also be able to handle self-pity (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Infants’ Perception of Arrows of Time",
      "abstract": "Since the advent of cinematography, adults have seen films of impossible, backward events, events that had never been witnessed by humans before. More than 100 years later, backward film segments of a person diving \"out of\" a swimming pool or a dropped and shattered pitcher magically reassembling itself remain compelling. Although the experience of such events is often entertaining, if one looks more deeply into the phenomena, one sees that they could provide significant insights into important topics in psychology, including the processes underlying the perception and understanding of normal dynamic events. To detect the anomaly of backward versions of temporally unidirectional events, one must have internal representations of how events typically unfold over time, representations that are engaged by the aberrant displays. Are a person's reactions based on relatively automatized perceptual representations of the dynamics of the world, on more conceptual knowledge about the properties of different materials, or on some other kind of representation? How and when do these abilities develop? Are people equipped with innate modules that constrain their interpretations of events such as falling or breaking, or are expectations about such events gradually abstracted from repeated encounters with everyday events? The perception of temporal reversals of unidirectional events has received surprisingly little attention from researchers.",

      "title": "Graspable foods and tools elicit similar responses in visual cortex",
      "abstract": "Extrastriatal visual cortex is known to exhibit distinct response profiles to complex stimuli of varying ecological importance (e.g., faces, scenes, and tools). The dominant interpretation of these effects is that they reflect activation of distinct \"category-selective\" brain regions specialized to represent these and other stimulus categories. We sought to explore an alternative perspective: that the response to these stimuli is determined less by whether they form distinct categories, and more by their relevance to different forms of natural behavior. In this regard, food is an interesting test case, since it is primarily distinguished from other objects by its edibility, not its appearance, and there is evidence of food-selectivity in human visual cortex. Food is also associated with a common behavior, eating, and food consumption typically also involves the manipulation of food, often with the hands. In this context, food items share many properties in common with tools: they are graspable objects that we manipulate in self-directed and stereotyped forms of action. Thus, food items may be preferentially represented in extrastriatal visual cortex in part because of these shared affordance properties, rather than because they reflect a wholly distinct kind of category. We conducted fMRI and behavioral experiments to test this hypothesis. We found that behaviorally graspable food items and tools were judged to be similar in their action-related properties, and that the location, magnitude, and patterns of neural responses for images of graspable food items were similar in profile to the responses for tool stimuli. Our findings suggest that food-selectivity may reflect the behavioral affordances of food items rather than a distinct form of category-selectivity.",

      "abstract": "Context is everything. Playing, exploring, artmaking, religion, literature, are not activities but contexts. Play is the way we encounter the multilayered nature of communication in humans and animals, in art forms and nature. Living beings learn to say as-if and sort-of; playing with these messages is the starting place of creativity, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. In the 1950s, Gregory Bateson elucidated how all this works and set the stage for innumerable insights into how messages like “this is play,” “this is art,” “this is science,” affect our understanding of what we see and hear, do and say. “This is play” can be our great opening into artistic and metaphoric activity, but such messages can also be perverted to manipulate us in innumerable ways. Levels of communication connect over, under, around and through each other. Mixtures and degrees of play, mixtures and degrees of friendship or romantic love—all these contexts, like the Klein bottle, have no inside and no outside, and are more intricate than any idea we can have of them. To be able to function in joy and freedom is the gift of play. We come to understand that not only is all communication inflected, but the inflection is the communication itself.",

Although all three kinds of social kinds are mind‐dependent, this does not make them ontologically subjective or preclude them from being natural kinds. Rather, what prevents the third kind of social kinds from being natural kinds is that their properties are conventionally rather than causally linked.",

Lack of affection and insecure attachment bonds are breeding grounds, “kitchens”, where false identities, role reversal or identities of feeling insignificant to their caregivers are cooked; this is what they refer to as being \"nobody\". Two clinical cases are used to illustrate this way of being in the world. \"They might say good or bad things about me, but at least they talk about me\", says Antonio, the 41-year-old patient we'll be discussing in this presentation. It is within the patient-therapist bond where patients find an opportunity to learn a new way of interacting and relating to others. Modifying their implicit relational knowing, they have a second chance to build a secure attachment with their therapist. We are emotional beings, regulating emotions through our relations; thus, our principal focus is relationships/interactions. \"You're my only support,” says the patient to the therapist, “I can be me, Antonio, with you; but outside I'm Anthony, the dealer and addict\". It's from here on that he can forgo feeling \"nobody\" and gain access to his singularity: simply be himself. This can come about because he has felt listened to and seen by his therapist. Feeling felt helps to build his identity.",

First, the small space leads to physical confinement. The space is almost undifferentiated for the various activities, and borders are strong between in-group and out-group. Second, the social isolation from outside—a counterpart of physical isolation—becomes social confinement inside. Third, there is unreduced time. The members of the group do not spend a short period of time together, but a long one; the time is no longer distributed nor differentiated. In an isolated small group, as is particularly obvious in Altman's experiments, there is an additional disharmony in the correlations between the order of physical distances and the order of emotional relationships. Altman presented a model of individual personality as related to social environment and exchanges with the others; but, however rich it may be, it is not a model of the group.",

Tourist experiences are believed to be multi-faceted, dynamic and evocative through interactive processes in which the tourist passively or actively engages. Consumer researchers have articulated that service organizations are unique due to their special characteristics such as inseparability, perishability, heterogeneity, and inconsistency. Tourist experiences include these four characteristics; however, they largely differ from traditional services. In experiential consumption hedonic and eudaimonic needs and emotions dominate the perceived experience value which are vital in managing long-term customer relationships. Tourist interaction deals with involvement, contribution and creation, which may be of a direct or an indirect nature. Direct interaction is when the individual is in contact with another person or an object. Indirect interaction is when the individual is in contact with a person or an object through another party such as a tour operator or a medium.",

There is no fine boundary of measurable variables that can be established to draw the line along which we can look at clear cut cause and effect relationships in either direction across that boundary. Any attempt to make either the social system or the technological system the independent or dependent variable is only a short term artifice that might very well give the wrong indicators of what is happening. Once this premise is accepted, one is led to the necessity of viewing the introduction of any new communication technology as a series of incremental and evolutionary experiments on a total system. Whether consciously or unconsciously done, the people involved, the social relationships, and the technology are all design elements for the experiment. One cannot apply reductionist methods to the social studies of this area.\"Society is like a lawn, where every roughness is smoothed, every bramble eradicated, and where the eye is delighted by the smiling verdure of a velvet surface.

Naess was among the first to put the question of self at the center of environmental philosophy and laid cautious claim to ‘introduce … a concept of ecological self’ for the first time. Naess’ ‘ecological self’ is vitiated by at least four flaws: (i) an eclectic and mutually inconsistent set of informative sources (Freud, Fromm, William James; Mohandas Ghandhi and Advaita Vedanta); (ii) a narrow conception of ethics drawn principally from Kant; (iii) inattention to state-of-the-art ecology (the science) as a model for an ecological self; (iv) reinforcing rather than deconstructing the insidious notion of self as substance. A self resonant with ecology would posit the self as a knot, nexus, or node in a skein of social and environmental relationships. Such relationships are internal. The classical antecedent of such an ecological self is not the Hindu Ātman/Brahman—the universal substance in all—as per Naess, but the Buddhist Anātman or Anattā (No-self)/Śūnyatā (Emptiness).

Human perception is limited by the capacity of sense organs; or rather the functionality of human perception is limited by sense organs, functionality of the human perception is limited bybyte speed and architecture of the neural network; functionality of human perception is limited by and the number of distinct perceptions the brain can analyze at any one time. Despite functional limitations, human consciousness is seamless, meaning that each perception and behavior flows smoothly from one to the next. When consciousness is equivalent to stable perception and behavior and stable perception are is seamlessly integrated, when consciousness destabilizes perception and behavior loses cohesion until we are no longer in control of our thoughts and actions Destabilization of consciousness can happen all at once. Like (instantaneously without any time lag) in the case of being knocked unconscious, but more often it happens incrementally(with time lag d^1(eb)d^2…….d^n) as various aspects of consciousness enter into a low- power subconscious or unconscious state, as in going to sleep. The EM spectrum ranges from gamma rays, which have a very short wavelength and very high energy, to radio waves, which have a very long wavelength and very low energy. Visible light makes up a very small portion of the spectrum Highly constrained back-projection (HYPR) is a data acquisition and reconstruction method that provides very rapid frame update rates and very high spatial resolution for a time series of images while maintaining a good signal-to-noise ratio and high image quality. In this study we used simulations to evaluate the temporal and spatial characteristics of images produced using the HYPR algorithm. The simulations demonstrate that spatial accuracy is well maintained in the images and the temporal changes in signal intensity are represented with high fidelity. The waveforms representing signal intensity as a function of time obtained from regions-of-interest placed in simulated objects track the true curves very well, with variations from the truth occurring only when objects with very different temporal behavior are very close to each other. However, even when objects with different temporal characteristics are touching, their influences on each other are small.",

Causes and occasions are of the most various types, difficult to compare between persons, often moulded by the currents of the day, inherited ways of thinking, experiences and environment. Querulants are personalities, who, after colliding with the legal system and having had their own claims dismissed, suffer from an often chief and irremediable feeling of being victim of an injustice. They cannot understand that, what is in due form valid can, when, scrutinized with the greatest sense of justice and practical common sense, impress upon someone as injustice. The submission to the unattainable, the parting from hopes, expectations and claims do not materialize. The step by step stiffening readiness for action can be confined to the lawsuit matter, it comes however about, that it extends to further spheres of life. Escalations occur in particular then, when the authorities course of action, courts of justice and opponents are felt as tyrants or mortal threat. A person deriving a meaning from his entire life or events, which he interprets for himself, makes his relations to the community and Law fragile [90]. Are presented within the framework of differential diagnostic distinctions, manifestations of querulous behaviour among abnormal personalities, neurotic disorders and schizophrenic psychoses under psychiatric aspects. Brought into sharper focus are the psychogenic psychoses, which became manifest in the USA, GUS and scandinavian countries in connection with serious querulous evolutions.

Thus, we mean communicative acts that are both verbal and non-verbal in nature; they are undertaken both by individuals and on larger human collectives, but also by organizations or institutions; the entities to which these actions are directed may also vary. Most often we stigmatize them as wrong, although in many specific cases we are ready to recognize their rightness. Our goal is to make visible the need to organize these acts from the perspective of a philosophically defined person-society relationship. We will also draw attention to the conditions that such depictions should meet.",

Despite occasional reportsof other animals appearing to pretend, nonhuman animals clearly do notdo what young children do, frequently using one object as if it wereanother , attributing imaginary properties to objects, and impersonatingother characters. Several hallmarks of human civilization appear to arisefrom the same cognitive underpinnings as pretend play . The philosopherW alton (1990) claimed that all human art forms are rooted in pretendplay . T o create and appreciate art, drama, and music, one suspends thehere and now . Hypothetical reasoning also shares this with pretending: Inboth, one temporarily suspends the present situation to imagine and par-take in a different one (Harris, 2000). Language is also akin to pretend-ing: In both genres, one entity (a word or object) represents another(Piaget, 1945/1962).Understanding minds has also been related to pretending, because rep-resen tin g m en tal represen tation s appears to un derlie both abilities(Flavell, Flavell, & G reen , 1987; Forguson & G opn ik, 1988; L eslie, 1987).On this account, children come to understand mental representation firstin pretend, and then apply that understanding to more difficult mentalstates like belief.

The traditional view is that the devastation of dementia is all that is left of the person we care for and love. It is often assumed that when a person is diagnosed with dementia their life is one long problem and their personality, intellect and relationships will diminish unrecognizably. This negative idea does little to help us live with dementia, never mind die with it. A social disability model allows us to consider the plight in a different way. A person's individuality can be maintained by accepting that everyone needs emotional attachment, even those who cannot clearly communicate that need, and carers can learn how to interpret what seemingly unrecognizable comments or behaviours mean.",

      "abstract": "The experience of emotion is a fundamental part of human conscious ness. Think, for example, of how different our conscious lives would be without such experiences as joy, anger, fear, disgust, pity, anxiety, and embarrassment. It is uncontroversial that these experiences typically have an intentional content. Anger, for example, is normally directed at someone or something. One may feel angry at one's stock broker for providing bad advice or angry with the cleaning lady for dropping the vase. But it is not uncontroversial that emotional experiences are always intentional. John Searle, for example, remarks, Many conscious states are not Intentional, e.g., a sudden sense of elation ... (1983, p. 2). Moreover, many animals experience emotions and it is natural to suppose that such emotions lack the sophistication of beliefs or thoughts. When a dog experiences delight in seeing its master after an absence of several days, the suggestion that at least part of the dog's experience of delight is a belief (or thought) that its master has returned home seems to import into the experience something that at best is associated with it and perhaps is not really a state to which the dog is subject at all. And even in the case of human beings, emotional experience often does not seem to involve thought. Consider the experience of disgust, to take one obvious example.' Nor is a salient belief required. One may have a strong fear of spiders and yet not believe that spiders typically pose any risk to humans. But if emotional experiences need not involve beliefs or thoughts, then just how are they intentional?2 Recent theories of consciousness have not devoted as much attention to the",

From the XVIth century and during all the XVIIth, it enlarges its uses as far as it becomes the notion we can't avoid nor refute nowadays. Through the study of its most important promoters, from Guichardin to Leibniz, and assuming that its introduction provides a solution that enables them to work out new problems they have to face, this work shows that the notion of interest is not a psychological motivation that would lead to the representation of a selfish man nor to the mere introduction of the utilitarian paradigm. The analysis of its uses (whether it's used to solve economic, moral or political problems), of its objects and subjects, of its qualities (either descriptive or normative, either particular or general) and of its ambivalent effects (utility, prejudice), enables to show that its stake is wider, in so far as the modelling of the reality is concerned. Interest works as a principle of action, as a corrective variable. It allows to get the phenomenons under control, to get a phenomenal representation of the relationships between the man and his world around. Its extension leads to an upgrading of tangible world, that gives the representation of value a new start, and appraises them throughout concurrence. Therefore, it takes part in the construction of modernity.",

      "abstract": "Too often in communicating information about radiation and radioactive materials, we encounter difficulties in conveying some of the most fundamental concepts, such its the distinction between radiation and contamination. These difficulties are caused in part by fuzzy thinking due to the imprecise or inappropriate use of language in our profession. In this paper, I disaggregate several concepts that are often lumped together, examining along the way, why we have come to use words the way we have. By separating source, exposure, intake or {open_quotes}ontake{close_quotes} of the source, and irradiation, I illustrate why phrases like {open_quotes}internal exposure{close_quotes} should be abandoned in favor of clearer terminology that communicates to non-experts and scientists outside of health physics. Four sources are identified: airborne, food- and drink-borne and surface- and liquid-borne radioactive materials, and penetrating radiation sources (machines and radioactive materials) that remain at a distance from the body. Five kinds of exposures are identified: person encounters contaminated air; person consumes contaminated food or drink; person`s skin is penetrated by contaminated material; persons skin contacts contamination or contaminated surface; and person comes in proximity to source of penetrating radiation. The processes of intake and {open_quotes}ontake{close_quotes} (material contacting skin) of the sources, as being distinct frornmore » the exposures, are discussed. Finally, the time course and process of irradiation in each case is described. The fact that exposure and irradiation are essentially the same for external sources has muddied the essential distinction between these concepts for materials that get on or in the body and only then begin to irradiate a person.« less",

      "abstract": "Evidence for all sorts of cognition in animals is mounting. But is this accompanied by conscious sensation or phenomenology? To answer that question, it is noted that consciousness to us presents itself as a contrast: we are asleep or awake, we either see something or we don't, each state or condition accompanied by distinct neural correlates. The contrast implicitly holds there is conscious sensation; you cannot lose what you didn't have to begin with. So if there is similar behavioural and neural evidence for a conscious–unconscious contrast in any animal, there should be some sort of difference in the 'what it is likes' between the two extremes — for the animal in question. Findings from sleep, anaesthesia, blindsight, masking, and rivalry present unequivocal evidence for such a dichotomy in monkeys and — surprisingly — possibly insects. For other animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish) the situation is less clear, although mostly due to a lack of evidence rather than evidence to the contrary. Implications for theories of consciousness, and the role of neural versus behavioural findings, are discussed.",

Anyone who believes that Wittgenstein's remarks here embody important truths has quite a bit of explaining to do. What needs to be explained is why it is that enormous numbers of people, people who have never had the chance to be corrupted by reading Descartes or Dennett, are willing, with only the slightest prompting, to speak in ways which appear to conflict dramatically with Wittgenstein's thought. Many people appear to find no difficulty at all in the idea that we could ascribe thoughts, sensations, emotions and so on to things which in no way resemble or behave like a living human being—for example to disembodied ‘minds’ or ‘souls’ or disembodied brains floating in tanks. And with a little more pressing many will agree that it is never to the living human being that these states are, strictly speaking, correctly ascribed; but, rather, to one part of the living human being—the brain, for example. Now if this incredibly widespread tendency is the expression of confusion then we need an explanation of its existence. We need this partly because without it it will be difficult to undermine the tendency; and partly because we might expect that such a widespread tendency is a distortion of some truth.",

Disgust has no place in the body, whose function is to incarnate language. As an expressive fallback, the affect reports a triggering of the thought process as a body event of unconscious language. The hysteric anorexic expresses desire as taste for nothing. Exulting in deprivation, the anorexic vomits the sexual as contact with reality. Surrounded by an obsession with death, disgust becomes general inappetence. Under pressure from rumination, as a dialectal expression of hysteria, inappetence becomes an exultation in retention of matter, midway between sloth and moral cowardice. It constitutes abhorrence of castration as contact with death. As a line of defence against desire, disgust and inappetence represent a battle-ground between dissatisfaction and impossibility where the body's weakness and gratification, associated with the effects of spoken existence, stands condemned.",

To conceive normativity in this fashion we also need to change our image and practice of thinking, i.e., we need to endorse thoughtfulness, which consists in the ability and willingness to widen the scope (or, sometimes, change) that which we find insightful. This approach to normativity, and this image and practice of thinking, is at odds with the dominant contemporary approach to normativity, which, it is argued here, is characterised by an attempt to play god, i.e., to create and play in artificial, fantasy worlds where we can know and master all there is to know, such that we can read off, or determine in advance, the appropriateness or correctness of future actions (or events, beliefs, etc). As long as we continue to play gods in our approach to normativity, we will continue to hide away from our limitations, including, most importantly, our fallibility, animality and mortality. When we hide away from our limitations in this way we radically underestimate the demands of moral and political life.",

      "abstract": "Infants can see someone pointing to one of two buckets and infer that the toy they are seeking is hidden inside. Great apes do not succeed in this task, but, surprisingly, domestic dogs do. However, whether children and dogs understand these communicative acts in the same way is not yet known. To test this possibility, an experimenter did not point, look, or extend any part of her body towards either bucket, but instead lifted and shook one via a centrally pulled rope. She did this either intentionally or accidentally, and did or did not address her act to the subject using ostensive cues. Young 2-year-old children but not dogs understood the experimenter's act in intentional conditions. While ostensive pulling of the rope made no difference to children's success, it actually hindered dogs' performance. We conclude that while human children may be capable of inferring communicative intent from a wide variety actions, so long as these actions are performed intentionally, dogs are likely to be less flexible in this respect. Their understanding of communicative intention may be more dependent upon bodily markers of communicative intent, including gaze, orientation, extended limbs, and vocalizations. This may be because humans have come under selective pressure to develop skills for communicating with absent interlocutors - where bodily co-presence is not possible.",

But to not look is to refuse recognition of these suffering bodies and to accept their effacement (in death and mediation) as subjects. This paper adopts a Levinasian approach to 'the face' to discern a way for the viewer to bear witness and establish a social connection with mediated bodies in suffering. Ultimately, for the viewer, it is not agency but responsiveness that matters, a passive engagement; an openness and a readiness to respond to the Other's call upon us, which makes possible a meaningful engagement. The effacement of mediated bodies in suffering cannot be reversed, but in the viewer's recognition and respons(ibility) it can be exceeded, transcended and they can be re-covered finally as subjects.",

      "title": "Probleme und Konzepte der Lithium-Forschung aus psychologischer Sicht",
      "abstract": "In psychological lithium research one is not only confronted with diverging findings, very heterogenous objects and methods, but also completely different theoretical frames of reference. Three concepts can be distinguished: lithium is considered as a chemical substance leading to biochemical changes which are responsible 1) for the disappearance or non-manifestation of the affective psychosis, 2) for physiological changes, and 3) for changes of so-called normal psychological functions. Within the context of lithium induced effects on normal psychological functions different scientific aims can be distinguished: either the relevance of psychic effects for the performance of daily activities is considered; or special indications such as aggressiveness are searched for; or normal psychic functions are examined as a model for psychotic processes. Most authors have investigated psychic effects of lithium as single phenomena not related to each other, nor to unchanged normal psychological functions. It is, however, rather unlikely that psychotropic drug effects would not develop their own dynamics, influencing other psychic functions. From a psychological point of view three conceptual possibilities may be distinguished: 1) Lithium induced direct effects on psychotic symptoms interfere with other psychotic symptoms or with non-psychotic processes. 2) Lithium-induced direct effects on normal psychic functions during the free interval of patients or in normal volunteers interfere with other psychic functions. 3) Lithium-induced effects on normal psychic functions are related to the prophylactic response (prophylactic relationship). The prophylactic relationship can be interpreted in three ways according to the chosen protocol: 1) Predictors can be obtained for the prophylactic response. 2) Psychological changes acting as condition for lithium prophylaxis may be found. 3) Factors relevant for the etiology of the psychosis may be elucidated. Such etiological factors might be found for instance within the concept of the \"typus melancholicus\" of Tellenbach. Independent of the actual findings of empirical studies a theoretical question always arises, i.e. whether psychotic phenomena should be conceived as something categorically different from normal psychological phenomena. This question cannot be answered empirically, because in every description this question is always implicitly decided. And this decision determines the possible methodological approaches towards single phenomena or complex models. If psychopathological phenomena are conceived as something which is not categorically different from normal psychic processes, then, these phenomena can only be specifications of phenomena known within general psychology. It must, then, be possible to describe them by general psychological theories, though with those specifications distinguishing the psychopathological from the non-pathological phenomena. Thus, the typus melancholicus and the depression would then be conceived as specifications of normal psychic processes. A conditional relationship between primary personality and psychosis would, then, be possible from a theoretical point of view, because a conditional relationship requires a general substantial concept connecting condition and what is conditioned.",

We may be kind and understanding and be recognizing likenesses with ourselves or what we cherish, or we may be hostile and without an ability to recognize any likenesses with ourselves.  As such our attitudes are expressions of emotional dispositions for experiencing things in a specific value-laden way, and values come into existence from the awareness of our attitudes to various things and reflections on their goodness and badness, rightness or wrongness - i.e. whether our attitudes reflect our right values. Values therefore seem to be pondered  attitudes, but his is by far normally the case. Most often values are traditionally accepted ways of viewing what is good and bad and right and wrong to do on this background of values and the actions therefore are not necessarily reflected and in accordance with what might be the right or true values. An examination of the possibly right values involves a deep reflection on human life and the nature of values and that includes all the aspects of human life - i.e. our relationship to nature:  to surrounding nature and to ourselves. We might discover the problematic relationship of human beings to nature on the background of destruction and perhaps hence exploitation and climate-change, but we might also start the other way round and ask which values - and that means which human and cultural conditions made it possible to develop values and attitudes that have over-exploitive and destructive consequences for nature - and ourselves.",

We take a systematic approach integrating all the equations of motions of the characters, objects, and articulated environment parts in a single QP formulation in order to embrace and solve the most general instance of the problem, where independent individual character controllers would fail to account for the inherent coupling of their respective motions through those physical and behavioral interactions.

      "abstract": "Organization is basic to all biological systems. It can be considered as the non-random arrangement of matter, and, according to Pittendrigh (1958), differs from mere order in that it is relative and end-directed (i.e. organized with respect to something). Organization occurs at all levels of biology, from molecular and cellular structure in the individual organism to functional relationships in the ecosystem. The organization of a population through spatial arrangement of its individuals in the environment is termed pattern (Pielou 1969). Most definitions of pattern are based on the kind of mechanism determining its character. Hutchinson (1953) categorized pattern into five types on the basis of such determinant mechanisms. These include: (a) vectorial pattern, in which the noted distribution is influenced by external factors such as gradients of temperature and humidity; (b) reproductive pattern as contributed by the incomplete dispersal of offspring; (c) social pattern, delineated by signalling and communication; (d) coactive pattern, where interaction among species determines distribution; and (e) stochastic pattern, where distribution depends on random forces. In practice, it is often difficult to pigeonhole pattern into such groups, since, in a natural situation, one or more of these mechanisms may contribute to the pattern exhibited by an animal population. Delineation of the importance of various mechanisms in determining local pattern character is valuable, though, for the understanding it can provide of the function of pattern and the underlying adaptation it represents. The study of pattern and thus of the adaptation basic to pattern is not merely 'an optional preoccupation with fascinating fragments of natural history: it is the core of biological study' (Pittendrigh 1958). Adaptation suits individuals to their environment in such a way that reproductive efficiency is achieved and the genotype of the most efficient reproducer predominates. Such adaptations can appear in the pattern of individuals occupying a habitat and thus much can be learned from the study of local pattern. Previous study (Riechert, Reeder & Allen 1973) of the local distribution of the funnel web spider (Agelenopsis aperta (Gertsch)) in desert grassland and recent lava bed habitats in south-central New Mexico, distinguished the operation of both intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of pattern. Adult spiders evidenced both social pattern in a mean spacing of individuals and vectorial pattern in the association of their webs with specific habitat features. The results reported here concern the change of local pattern with age of individuals and season. The functioning of the pattern of local distribution for Agelenopsis is discussed in the light of this additional information.",

      "abstract": "Hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language are all used in sign language to communicate. Either word level signs or fingerspelling make up a sign language. For the deaf-dumb community, it is their sole means of communication. However, hearing individuals never attempt to learn sign language. As a result, hearing-impaired people are unable to converse with hearing people without a sign language interpreter. Because of this, deaf persons are socially isolated. Therefore, a system that can decode sign language automatically is required. The execution of such a system gives hearing-impaired people a platform for communication without the help of anyone. One of the most traditional and organic kinds of language for communicating is sign language. Sign language based on fingerspelling technique employing neural networks. Deaf and dumb people use sign language, a kind of nonverbal communication, to communicate. D&amp;M individuals can only communicate through sign languages due to a single communication-related disability that prevents them from utilising spoken languages. Exchanging thoughts and messages through a variety of channels, such as speaking, signalling, behaviour, and visuals, is the act of communication. People (D&amp;M) without hearing or speech use their hands to produce a range of gestures to communicate with others.",

      "title": "Personality and its disorders",
      "abstract": "Personality is a difficult concept to define: it is ex­tremely hard to encapsulate what makes a person ‘who they are’ in general terms. Personality is typically thought of as the set of characteristics which make us think, feel, and act in our own unique way. Personality is pervasive; people tend to behave in similar ways throughout life and across differing social and inter­personal contexts. The characteristics of personality, called traits, are a set of common features which are observed in variable degrees in different people. Traits provide a useful structure in which to describe a per­sonality: Box 31.1 shows some common personality traits. Some traits may be perceived as an asset to the individual, while others are more of a nuisance. We all have a little more or a little less of any given trait. The word ‘temperament’ rather than personality is used to describe the behavioural characteristics dis­played by young children. This is because our person­ality takes time to develop; it is shaped by a multitude of environmental, biological, and factors which interact throughout early life. By our late teens or early twenties, the majority of individuals have the set of traits which define the personality we will have for the rest of our lives. Having an understanding of an individual’s per­sonality helps clinicians to predict their patients’ re­sponse to illness and its treatment. The majority of us have some less favourable aspects to our personality, but we work around them and/ or have more prominent favourable traits that allow us to get on with our lives. For a minority of people, their less favourable traits are so prominent that they cause problems for themselves or for those around them. It is these people who we think of as having a personality disorder. It is extremely difficult to draw a line between normal personality and personality disorder, so this simple pragmatic approach is helpful in clinical practice. People with a personality disorder may: … ● have difficulties with social situations and relationships; ● have difficulties controlling their feelings and/ or behaviour; ● react in unusual ways to illness or to treatment; ● behave in unusual ways when mentally ill; ● have more extreme or unusual reactions to stressful events; ● behave in ways that are detrimental to themselves or others ● be more prone to developing other types of mental disorder.",

We call such relationships between objects behavioral relationships because they arise out of the behaviors, or actions, taken by one object X relative to another object Y. With behavioral relationships, object X is either temporarily handed a reference to object Y as an argument in a method call or temporarily requests a reference to Y from another object Z. However, the emphasis is on temporary; when X is finished communicating with Y, object X often discards the reference to Y.",

      "title": "An Evolutionary Context for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Everything we now are-including our anatomy, functioning, and emotional life—arises from past forms, functions, and feelings and, as such, is shaped at least as much by the distant past as by the near past and the present. It is therefore difficult to understand why psychiatry has paid so little attention to evolutionary processes; but perhaps, this neglect can be traced to the fact that man has so long considered himself to be unique that the comparatively recent idea of his unity with and descent from the rest of the animal world has taken something over 100 years since Darwin's time to percolate into the general consciousness. The variability in phenotype afforded by genetic inheritance provides each generation of a species with a sufficient range of individuals that some, proving more adaptive to the contemporary environment than others, prosper and over time come to suffuse and dominate the gene pool of their population. Thus the appearance of a variation that proves valuable for survival in even a single creature in a population will be found at a geometrically progressive rate in succeeding generations until a large proportion if not all members of the breeding group manifest it. The earlier form or function, however, is not entirely eliminated. It is retained recessively in the genetic potential of the group and occasionally emerges. It remains available, so to speak, should circumstances favor it once again. The form and function of any creature at any given point in time, therefore, is in effect a selection made by environmental pressures out of a repertoire of forms and functions genetically available to it. Hindsight, viewing the sequence of actual realizations, generates a notion of purpose or direction.",

If a live model presents an opportunity to study human anatomy or embodied gestures without the interruption of clothing, participants would likely focus upon parts which normally remain private. Instead, it is not rare to see sketches and work which could have been produced while permitting the model to wear swimwear or even substantial clothing.Nudity's status within the artist-live model relationship will be one topic of this essay. Three additional questions will be (1) the model's motivation; (2) the degree of agency attributed to the model: for some, a mere prop; for others, a full-fledged performer; (3) the role of 'art' in the live model session given how much of it remains incomplete and not displayed.",

      "abstract": "The organization of brain processes leading to language and movement show important parallels with one another and also express important aspects of biological organization in general. Four major differences between biological processes and their commonly proposed analogues, machine processes, are as follows. 1) Reduction is not simplification in biological analysis; rather the subsystems that result from separation of parts of a biological system are themselves complex, often potentially viable, systems. 2) Machine processes are typically generalized, or, if specialized, they are specialized by connecting general-type subsystems in special ways. But biological systems are typically specialized at many levels, both in subsystems and their connections. 3) The history of a biological system is often an intimate and inseparable part of its structure. Furthermore biological systems never develop alone or de novo. Not only do they develop in clusters of contemporaries, they also develop in the presence of an older generation and a “culture.” 4) Not only do formal logics have some constraints that biological minds may not have (e.g., internal consistency and universality), formal logics require descriptions of qualitative phenomena in a language that is inadequate and (as a deeper issue) may always require parsing a meaningful whole into approximate parts (e.g., as in writing this abstract). Instances of contrasts between biological systems and machine-type systems are seen in language and movement phenomena, such as embodying a distinction between purposes and causes and having flexibly reorganizable subassemblies, multiple goals, and motor equivalence.",

      "abstract": "All investigative, expressive and creative endeavours—cate gorised as intellectual, artistic, scientific and so on—are ultimately attempts to search, seek or to rediscover one's relationship with the cosmos and find a place in the universe. These kinds of endeavours either arise out of some presumed—a priori— socially conditioned metaphysical assumptions or out of a recreation of new metaphysical truths, perhaps, directly perceived. At some point or points in one's life these attempts gain primacy, as in 'crisis' periods, when one needs to reaffirm a harmonious relationship between the self and the world in which one lives. (The falseness or truth of the duality of 'self and the world' need not be discussed at the moment.) The self in this case may be defined as the person (with a self-image) who projects and identifies himself with other persons and other non-human existence as also, especially, with various socio-cultural concepts such as family, society, nation and so on. Individual existence implies relationships, be it with nature or humans; whether this relationship exists in the person's mind or outside, he or she cannot do without it. The word 'person, synonym for self, is deliberately used because it means 'mask' (Latin derivative—persona). This particular use of the term 'person' is different from the category of 'being', or 'human being'. In fact, even the word 'individual' is derived from the root word 'whole' or 'complete'. In this sense, the same applies to the word 'alone'—all one (not to be confused with lonely), i.e. it is derived from the root of being One without a second—referring to a total, complete individual. In turn, whole-complete is the same as holistic, implying 'one-ness'. From this flows the idea of being holy, virtuous, and that is inseparable from the notions of beauty, goodness, love and creation. The experience of all these words may only be known within",

      "title": "Law is Not or Must Not Be Just Verbal and Visual in the 21st Century: Toward Multisensory Law",
      "abstract": "Humans are multisensory beings and live in a multisensory world. Human communication involves the production and perception of messages, as well as the five senses (hearing, vision, touch, taste, and smell). Multimodal or multisensory systems are capable of receiving and sending information by using various sensory channels involving vision, hearing, and movement, but preferably all five senses. Such computer systems are used not only in human communication but also in machine communication. These systems have brought forth a trend toward multisensory digital communication practices in the 21st century. Such multisensory digital media help us produce meaning by using two or more discrete sign systems (i.e., audio-visual, visual-kinaesthetic, tactile-kinaesthetic, and so forth). The advent of digital media and their implications for the law has prompted some scholars to suggest that a visual turn is also occurring in the legal context. Whereas this may be partly true, by restricting or confining the law to the verbal and visual, legal discourse has difficulties in becoming sufficiently aware of multisensory digital media and thus fails to adequately explore these media and their impact on the law â€” in overt contradiction to the growing significance of such media. Overemphasising both verbal and visual legal communication leads to marginalising or even to ignoring other modalities of already existing or future digital legal communication. Given these problems, this paper seeks to develop tentative answers to five key questions: 1. What is multisensory law? 2. What are the impacts of multisensory digital media on the law? 3. How could or rather should greater awareness be raised in legal discourse about the current and future relevance of multisensory digital media for the law? 4. How could or rather should the marginalising and ignoring of multisensory digital legal communication practices be challenged? 5. How are these research questions relevant to legal discourse, particularly legal history, legal informatics, legal pedagogy, legal psychology, and legal theory? In addressing these questions, this paper draws on insights from different legal and non-legal disciplines, such as the anthropology of the senses, communication studies, legal history, legal informatics, legal psychology (therapeutic jurisprudence), legal theory, multisensory law, perceptual psychology, and so forth.",

The masking is conscious when one represses some crude exclamation or modestly covers some part of the body. Man conceives of himself and passes judgment on himself in three different ways: in each of his acts, taken separately; in his being as a whole, as a person; and in the complete development of his life, his entire existence including its termination. The justification of the whole life is of concern primarily to one who feels it has come to an end, either because he considers the active period of his life to have ceased or because he is confronted with death.

Comparative research with humans and non-human great apes has typically investigated joint commitment by experimentally interrupting joint actions to study subjects' resumption strategies. However, such experimental interruptions are human-induced, and thus the question remains of how great apes naturally handle interruptions. Here, we focus on naturally occurring interruptions of joint actions, grooming and play, in bonobos and chimpanzees. Similar to humans, both species frequently resumed interrupted joint actions (and the previous behaviours, like grooming the same body part region or playing the same play type) with their previous partners and at the previous location. Yet, the probability of resumption attempts was unaffected by social bonds or rank. Our data suggest that great apes experience something akin to joint commitment, for which we discuss possible evolutionary origins.",

      "abstract": "In reality, however, every ego, so far from being a unity is in the highest degree a manifold world, a constellated heaven, a chaos of forms, of states and stages, of inheritances and potentialities.1The names of the characters in English and Dutch drama of the late medieval and early modem eras make it clear that there was a proliferation of negative conceptual characters.2 These names by themselves give little further information as to the kind of character involved: it could be a protagonist, a minor vice, a devil, or, depending on whether it is an English or a Dutch play, a Vice or a sinne ken. The distinction between these various kinds of characters resides to some extent in their dramatic function: the protagonists tend to be victims whereas the vices, Vice, and sinnekens tend to be instigators of the action. Another distinguishing factor is the prominence given to characters: the Vice and sinnekens generally have more lines and more stage presence than the minor vices. Their theatricality can also tell us something about the characters: the Vice and sinnekens are normally more entertaining and memorable than the other characters. The distinction between the devil on the one hand and the Vice, sinnekens, and minor vices on the other seems to have been primarily one of costume. The other element of difference lies in the fact that the devil is not a personification but rather a 'theological-mythological being' unlike the other kinds of negative characters who are personifications of negative human characteristics and who are to some degree represented as humans.3Three forms of personification are particularly important for the moral plays under discussion.4 Firstly, there is personification or prosopopoeia, i.e. 'the translation of any non-human quantity into a sentient human capable of thought and language, possessing voice and face', as Reason in Medwall's Nature. Secondly, characters can be formed by isotyping, i.e. 'the representation of a collective where there is only a quantitative difference between the abstract personified and its personifier', which is used in the everyman figure. Thirdly, there is typification leading to 'exemplary property characters', that is 'characters who exemplify the abstract qualities reflected in their names', such as Den Daghelicxschen Snaetere (The Daily Chatterbox) in Everaert's Tspel van dOnghelycke Munte (The Play of Unequal Coinage). Typification is a variety of isotyping, and I shall use the term type to describe characters based on either personification strat egy. The main distinction between personification, on the one hand, and isotyping and typification, on the other hand, is that the former tends to lead to unchangeable, immortal characters - even if they are visually represented as humans -, whereas types tend to be changeable and mortal.Minor vices, the Vice, and sinnekens typically are personifications whereas the protagonists are normally types. However, this distinction is not always maintained. In the Dutch plays there tends to be a great deal of emphasis on the personified nature of especially the sinnekens: they are represented as eternal, general evils and they do not fear death. In the English plays, on the other hand, the supposedly immortal and unchangeable characters can be susceptible to death: Newguise in Mankind escapes being hanged and Courage in The tyde taryeth no man (henceforth Tide) is taken off to his execution at the end of the play.5 They are occasionally changeable: Perverse Doctrine in A new Enterlude ... entituled New Cusiome (henceforth New Custom) converts.6 Given the fact that the Vice and sinnekens and the minor vices normally belong to the same personification category, and given the oscillation between different personification strategies in the English tradition, the personified status of the Vice and sinnekens cannot be used to distinguish them from other vice characters. The boundaries between the various kinds of negative characters are not firm or clear in either the Dutch or the English plays and perhaps it would be foolhardy to define the different characters rigorously as this would go against the fluidity exemplified in the plays. …",

      "title": "Physiological Role of Pleasure",
      "abstract": "A given stimulus can induce a pleasant or unpleasant sensation depending on the subject's internal state. The word alliesthesia is proposed to describe this phenomenon. It is, in itself, an adequate motivation for behavior such as food intake or thermoregulation. Therefore, negative regulatory feedback systems, based upon oropharingeal or cutaneous thermal signals are peripheral only in appearance, since the motivational component of the sensation is of internal origin. The internal signals seem to be complex and related to the set points of some regulated variables of the \"milieu interieur,\" like set internal temperature in the case of thermal sensation. Alliesthesia can therefore explain the adaptation of these behaviors to their goals. Only three sensations have been studied— thermal, gustatory, and olfactory, but it is probable that alliesthesia also exists in such simple ways as in bringing a signal, usually ignored, to the subject's attention. For example, gastric contractions, not normally perceived, are felt in the state of hunger. Since alliesthesia relies on an internal input, it is possible that alliesthesia exists only with sensations related to some constants of the \"milieu interieur\" and therefore would not exist in visual or auditory sensations. As a matter of fact, luminous or auditory stimuli can be pleasing or displeasing in themselves, but there seems to be little variation of pleasure in these sensations, that is, no alliesthesia. There may be some esthetic value linked to these stimuli but it is a striking coincidence that they are in themselves rather neutral and that it is difficult to imagine a constant of the \"milieu interieur\" which could be possibly modified by a visual or an auditive stimulus—such as light of a certain wavelength or sound of a given frequency. In the light of this theory, it is possible to reconsider the nature of the whole conscious experience. The existence of alliesthesia implies the presence of internal signals modifying the conscious sensations aroused from peripheral receptors. It is therefore necessary to question the existence of sensations aroused by direct stimulation of central receptors, such as hypothalamic temperature detectors, osmoreceptors, and others. Does their excitation arouse sensations of their own, or does the sensation have to pass through peripheral senses? Only human experimentation could answer this question. In the same way, it is possible that self-stimulation of the brain is pleasant, not by giving a sensation in itself, but because the electrical stimulus, renders peripheral stimuli pleasant.",

      "title": "감시와 강요된 대화: 『막대한 유산』",
      "abstract": "In Great Expectation, its main characters are frequently in a forced dialogue condition. The desire to make the other listen and the desire to make the other speak are dominant in this forced dialogue situation Dialogue does not arise from the various individual points of view, but demonstrates a social field of pressures and disproportions. Dialogue as free, voluntary, and interactive behaviour is put into question in this text. Social codes and contracts are overwhelming enough to overshadow its characters, which blocks the possibilities of open, genuine and unconstrained dialogue. Great Expectations explores the field of sado-masochistic coercion and challenges the conception of man as a spontaneous and creative being. Its characters are less than free human individuals and under the tight social control and total manipulations of power, instead of being presented as fully-featured alive human being cbaractenstics. \nCharacters take no absolute freedom, being always limited and restrained even when they confess. Dostoevskian liberty is refuted in the forced power field; the social contract never allows a fully liberating spiritual situation. Instead of celebrating transcendental freedom, Great Expectations presents secular scenes based upon social contract and coercion Legal institutional power dominates the contracted in the coercive field of force. Those who are under observation and psychological pressure are forced to speak against their will. Great Expectations invites a contemplation of dialogue as forceful inquisition, which challenge, interactive and communicative power. In this context, Great Expectations is sharply different from a conventional novel based on psychological and moral insight.",

      "title": "Imposter syndrome? Check your biases",
      "abstract": "“Yeah, but everyone feels unqualified sometimes.” These words, spoken by a faculty member during a panel on imposter syndrome, gaslit me; the dismissal of an experience that is my own, the blindness to a topic that's worth seeing for what it is. Reduced to “feeling unqualified.” Is this what we are talking about when we talk about imposter syndrome? Imposter syndrome describes a person who believes they are deceptive, their real self hidden behind a well-developed façade, their successes undeserved. To have imposter syndrome is to feel like a liar. It is to be successful, but to have your success tainted by your very involvement or attributed to factors outside your control. Conversely, it is to take your failings and attribute them to weaknesses in yourself. It is deeply personal. How did this become a thing? The easiest way to understand the existence of imposter syndrome is as a social phenomenon. Social theory suggests that intergroup dynamics are how people understand their roles in the world. The ingroup, or group with power, maintains a status quo through conscious and subconscious behaviors and biases that sustain its position. In medicine, this group is White men, and that tradition is well documented and persistent. Outsiders who share categories with the ingroup, such as sex, race, education, or age, are recognized as belonging with the ingroup and therefore receive social cues of belongingness that promote cognitive assonance, allowing them to accept their successes as earned by virtue of category sharing. In other words, they identify with the powerful group and accept their power because of their own socially verified, reinforced biases. This defines privilege. Conversely, outsiders who have little overlap in their categorical membership with the ingroup are not perceived by the ingroup as belonging, even with similar “success.” These outsiders perceive these ingroup biases, ultimately feeling rejected and disconnected from the group. This is why imposter syndrome is more common in groups that are cued to feel that they do not “belong” here on the basis of race, sex, or other categories. Lack of belonging is an intrinsic part of imposter syndrome, but it is not the only part. Those with imposter syndrome cannot cheer for their own successes, and they incorporate their mistakes as a moral failing. To explain this, it is helpful to look harder at the process of social categorization. Social categorization is the cognitive and often subconscious process by which we sort individuals into social groups, assigning status and importance on the basis of easily definable categories in an automatic fashion. Female? Mentor. Male? Leader. Young? Inexperienced. Old? Wise. The same process that allows outsiders to identify with a powerful group by categorical matching alone allows us each to assign individuals to many hierarchical structures as a simple heuristic. Within our subconscious, we rapidly process individuals into desirable or nondesirable categories by which we understand the world. This is bias. For those in the group we have categorized as desirable, most commonly the ingroup, we attribute their successes to them and their failures to things outside their control. In the nondesirable group, we attribute their successes to luck or circumstance and their failures to their character flaws. Sound familiar? In this way, imposter syndrome is a form of unconscious bias held by the individuals that have it against their own selves. People with imposter syndrome have socially categorized themselves, automatically and subconsciously, and found themselves lacking, placing themselves in a nondesirable group. Their bias is extrinsically reinforced by group dynamics and systemic biases that also fail to extend belonging. This climate shapes the internal dialogue of these individuals, who cannot find common categories with the ingroup, reinforcing that they are outsiders and do not belong. What that means is, imposter syndrome will not be fixed by telling outsiders to be more confident. Confidence is not the issue. It will not be fixed by hiring outsiders into a group that does not promote their inclusion. Diversity does not create ingroup belonging by itself. It will not be fixed by pretending it's something everyone goes through. It is not. Imposter syndrome grows from an individual's bias, fed by systemic bias and upheld by dominant groups. If you want to fix imposter syndrome, you need to fix the climate that sustains it. The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.",

      "title": "Those Things That Hold Us Together: Taste and Sociology",
      "abstract": "The idea of reflexivity has much to offer to the analysis of taste - but reflexivity in its ancient sense, a form neither active nor passive, pointing to an originary state where things, persons, and events have just arrived, with no action, subject or objects yet decided. Objects of taste are not present, inert, available and at our service.They give themselves up, they shy away, they impose themselves. ‘Amateurs’ do not believe things have taste. On the contrary, they make themselves detect them, through a continuous elaboration of procedures that put taste to the test. Understood as reflexive work performed on one’s own attachments, the amateur’s taste is no longer considered (as with so-called ‘critical’ sociology) an arbitrary election which has to be explained by hidden social causes. Rather, it is a collective technique, whose analysis helps us to understand the ways we make ourselves sensitized, to things, to ourselves, to situations and to moments, while simultaneously controlling how those feelings might be shared and discussed with others.",

This may be the case with MCS and Time-Dependent Sensitization (TDS), a phenomenon we discovered in rats in the late 1970s and later named. TDS refers to the ability of mild stressors--whether pharmacological or environmental--to induce physiological and behavioral effects which then progress, i.e., get stronger, entirely as a function of the passage of time since stressor presentation. This strengthening is revealed when the organism is later exposed to either the original or another stressor. The characteristics of TDS bear a remarkable resemblance to the features of MCS and that similarity is the subject of this manuscript.",

      "abstract": "The underlying units of visual representation often transcend lower-level properties, for example when we see objects in terms of a small number of generic stimulus types (e.g. animals, plants, faces, etc.). There has been much less attention, however, to the possibility that we also represent dynamic information in terms of a small number of primitive *event types* — such as twisting, rotating, bouncing, rolling, etc. (In models that posit a “language of vision”, these would be the foundational visual *verbs*.) We explored the possibility that such ‘event type’ representations are formed quickly and spontaneously during visual perception — even when they are entirely task-irrelevant. We did so by exploiting the phenomenon of *categorical perception* — wherein the differences between two stimuli are more readily noticed when they are represented in terms of different underlying categories. Observers simply viewed pairs of images or animations (presented very briefly, one at a time), and reported for each pair whether they were the same or different in any way. Cross-Type changes involved switches in the underlying event type (e.g. a towel being *twisted* in someone’s hands, replaced by a towel being *rotated* in someone’s hands), while Within-Type changes maintained the same event type (e.g. a towel being more or less twisted in someone’s hands). Critically, this distinction was always task-irrelevant, and Within-Type changes were always objectively greater in magnitude than were Cross-Type changes. Nevertheless, Cross-Type changes were much more readily noticed. And additional controls confirmed that such effects could not be explained by appeal to lower-level stimulus differences (such as the different hand positions involved in twisting vs. rotating). This spontaneous perception of a potentially continuous range of stimuli in terms of a smaller set of primitive “visual verbs” might promote both generalization and prediction about how events are likely to unfold.",

      "abstract": "According to Nanay emic ideas, shamanic disease, which affects a shaman in the period of his or her formation, also affects his or her relatives, who begin to suffer from nervous disorders and other problems but recover at their new shaman’s incarnation. A similar spiritual correlation within the group of relatives becomes apparent also when a shaman is involved in a situation which connects him or her with the spiritual world (murder, death, incest, etc.), so that the consequences of such events influence not only the shaman, but also his or her kin.&#x0D; From the emic perspective, relations with the spirits have not only spiritual, but also biological components (emerging for instance, in the idea about the possibility of human-spiritual cohabitation), which opens up possibilities for spirituality to be inherited by descendants. These circumstances suggest that the social factors that unite the clan (exogamy etc.), are secondary to the religious factors, and probably used as a means to adapt to the spiritual problems that shamanists face. Running the danger of collective clan disease, people have to remember their clan peculiarity and exclusiveness and undertake common efforts for its avoidance. Being aware of their patrilineal descent and of their own place in it, people can define the circle of possible persons who are subject to similar mental and other troubles and who should look together for the means of a cure. The wish to ensure spiritual security results in the social prescriptions and taboos that form the patrilineal clan.",

      "title": "Individualism and Personalism",
      "abstract": "The nature of the self is qualified in varying ways in philosophy but, as we shall see in detail, one thing is constant: the self is the object of a subjective reflexivity or self-involvement. By this inner folding, a person maintains not only a relationship with himself, but also ascribes a reality value to what he relates to. The self is seen, for example, as the genuine deeper reality of the ego, as that which underlies every relation to the external world. Or just the opposite: it is nothing but a part of that external world, I relate to that self as to a thing in the world. Some thinkers even doubt the existence of such a self: for them, the belief in something like a self is created by certain peculiarities of language. For instance, to what does ‘self’ refer in a statement like “I wasn’t myself”, “I will help myself”, “I should give myself some rest”, etc? I will discuss two opposed conceptions of the nature of the self and indicate the shortcomings of each approach, in order to go on to show something about self-involvement and singularity that is often overlooked. The two opposed conceptions deal with the self in different ways because they also deal differently with the relation between consciousness and the self as such. In the first conception, this relation remains external: reflection is not of the same order as the self and, conversely, the self is something that always falls outside of reflection, something against which a position can be occupied and a (critical) distance taken. Here, the self is an object whose nature does not in the least affect the nature of reflection. To the contrary, the ego must explicitly identify with that object if there is to be any trace of a connection with it at all. I will refer to this position as that of individualism. The second conception sees the self and reflection as forming an organic unity preceding any conscious identifications. They are both fused into an organic totality in such a manner that any reflection becomes an expression of the self and is affected by it. There already exists, between the self and reflection, a preobjective relationship by virtue of which the self can never be considered as an object of identification. It is not an object: I have a link with myself that is more intimate, not the result of an identification but of an intuition, a feeling or a creativity. This is the personalistic conception of the self. The self and reflection share one and the same nature, and the relation between them is internal. I am always already myself without needing to identify with a self, and without needing to take a position with respect to a self. Moreover, I can never take the same position with respect to the self as I would take with respect to an object. If I did, I would have misconceived the authentic reality of that self, or of my ‘person’ and the intimate relationship that I maintain with it. What is original in the individualistic conception appears, from a personalistic viewpoint, to be only derived and inauthentic. Individualism confuses the deeper self (le moi profond) with a social marionette (le moi social). Personalism, as we shall see, also developed in reaction to an individualistic (Bergson would say: mechanistic) conception of the person. In this article, I will draw a distinction between the two approaches on the basis of their differing descriptions of the problem of freedom.",

      "abstract": "A debt of good will (utang na loob in Filipino) is incurred when a person becomes the beneficiary of significant assistance or favor given by another. Usually, the beneficiary is in acute need of the assistance given or favor granted. This provides an opportunity for the giving of help to serve as a vehicle for the expression of sympathy or concern. The debt could then be appreciated as one of good will because, by catering to another person's pressing need, the benefactor is able to express positive dispositions towards the beneficiary. It is not merely the receipt of the assistance or favor that puts the recipient in a position of indebtedness. The indebtedness is created by the benefactor's kagandahang loob (good will). An act can be considered to convey kagandahang loob only if it is done out of kusang loob (roughly, free will); and can only be considered to have been done out of kusang loob if the agent (1) is not acting under external compulsion, (2) is motivated by positive feelings (e.g. charity, love or sympathy) towards the beneficiary, and (3) is not motivated by the anticipation of reward. These conditions entail debt-of-goodwill relationships where the benefactor has no right to demand reciprocity but the beneficiary has a \"self-imposed\" obligation to repay kagandahang loob with kagandahang loob. Debts of good will are about some forms of justice. But we should not reduce all talk about debts of good will to talk about justice.",

      "abstract": "When moving from one place to another, people encounter a variety of things and persons. They encounter physical things, meet other people, and interact with them in a way that might be sensed as ‘divine’. The meanings emerging through human interactions in life appear when there is a presence of other human beings in the surrounding. Humans realise their meaningfulness within themselves when others find the same thing as well, that is, in realising the presence. Life turns into a meaningful experience when human beings treat their neighbours as a human being, and not as an object that does not react or respond when encountered. Regarding the others as a representation of our own relatedness with the divine may enable us respect human life, more than we value ourselves, for we realise that our relationship with fellow human beings is not the same as with objects around us. Our relation with the divine is situated in connectedness with other people so as to experience the beauty in relation. The divine needs humans not because he is weak, but because he has the desire to save and to make human’s life meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;",

In this article, I examine the extrusion of eyes in the Bellum Civile , where each instance of eye removal exposes the dysfunction of relationships in Lucan's Rome. The individual citizen, the family and the state display a dearth of introspection, a lack of allegiance to or recognition of friends, family and political allies and an unproductive or perverted desire for intimacy. All these deficits result from mental, intellectual or physical blindness and ultimately contribute to the destruction of the Republic.",

People who lead lives which can be defined as generically regular (as regards work, study, etc.) from Monday to Friday completely change their ways of being and living on Friday night. In order to emphasize, face, or sustain this change, drugs, especially designer drugs, are frequently used. The hypothesis is advanced that this may mean a rejection of the existential continuum that characterizes linear time and be a return to the phasic cyclical time attitude typical of ancient ages. Methods and attitudes for dealing with this problem are proposed.",

      "abstract": "The question of what responsibility humans have toward feral cats, if any, is a hotly contested one. Cats can be categorized in a number of ways: domesticated, stray, feral, and wild. However, of all these categories, feral cats are the most marginalized. Thus, they can pose a predicament for humans in terms of how or how not to care for them. Possible responses to this predicament range from leaving them alone; feeding them, but not neutering/spaying them; adopting a practice referred to as “trap, neuter, and release” (TNR), in which humans take responsibility for feeding cats, curbing their populations, and possibly monitoring their medical conditions; and even euthanizing them. This paper will provide an introduction to the issue of animal ethics in general and feral cats in particular; identify an ethical framework with which to address the issue of feral cats; explore the history of cat domestication; utilize a framework with which to examine the relationship of all cats to their environments; consider options for how to deal with feral cats in particular (TNR); explore and analyze data on TNR from the city of Philadelphia; and offer concrete solutions to the issue of the liminal feral cat.",

      "abstract": "Although there is extensive literature on bereavement after the loss of pets, it has almost exclusively focused on traditional pets, such as cats and dogs, to the exclusion of many other species that are also popular pets. We targeted caregivers of less-traditional pets, such as reptiles, birds, fish, and exotics, to assess their experiences when grieving their loss. Specifically, we examined the manner in which they reported the loss and the degree of perceived support they received from close and more distant associates as well as their grief over the loss. We surveyed 464 pet owners, 337 of whom reported the loss of a pet other than a cat or dog. We examined whether their experiences of grief, sharing loss, and receiving support differed from those of cat and dog owners. We also assessed the role of the pet (i.e., as companion or other), whether they were housed in an enclosure, concerns about the pet, and problem behaviors as predictors, with the owner's attachment to the pet as a mediator. Pet role, enclosure, and attachment significantly predicted grief. Overall, attachment was a better predictor than pet type for grief, reporting of the loss, and perceived support from others. These findings suggest that owners experience grief similarly for traditional and nontraditional pets as long as they feel bonded to their pets.",

      "abstract": "Atypical exemplars of taxonomic categories (e.g., clothing, furniture) differ from more typical exemplars along figurative dimensions of perceptual and contextual similarity. The advent of operational thought might be expected to facilitate category acquisition because it engenders a competence to suppress figurative dissimilarities and focus on nonfigurative similarities (e.g., common function). Age- and grade-equivalent preoperational and concrete operational groups were given oddity, sort, and category membership tasks with pictorial stimuli. Concrete operational subjects showed a greater appreciation than preoperational subjects for taxonomic relations involving atypical exemplars. Subjects of both cognitive levels could appreciate taxonomic relations involving strictly typical or moderately typical exemplars of a category. Results are interpreted as supporting a contention that meanings become more general with the emergence of operational thought. Superordinate concepts are abstract organizations such as clothing, furniture, fruit, and animal, having basic object concepts (e.g., skirt, pants; chair, table; apple, banana; bird, fish) as exemplars. The basic object level of a conceptual hierarchy is the most inclusive level at which the exemplars of a concept share a large number of features (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson,",

The fixed beliefs, intense emotions and pervasive defensiveness that constitute human irrationality are hardly amenable to logic, common sense and intellectual debate. A different set of skills are needed, quite unlike those of use in dealing with the more impersonal world. The incidence of such skills appears to be quite low due, it seems, to the combined effects of personal dispositions to avoid the irrational and inappropriate forms of education. This deficiency is not unique to the environmental disciplines but unfortunate in light of their claims to a broad perspective. It is argued that professional competence in the environmental area requires some capability in dealing with both natural and human irrationality. If this is to be achieved, a different emphasis is needed in environmental education, one that involves a concern for “process,” both intellectual and irrational.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the debate between emotion-expression and motive-communication approaches to facial movements, focusing on Ekman's (1972) and Fridlund's (1994) contrasting models and their historical antecedents. Available evidence suggests that the presence of others either reduces or increases facial responses, depending on the quality and strength of the emotional manipulation and on the nature of the relationship between interactants. Although both display rules and social motives provide viable explanations of audience “inhibition ” effects, some audience facilitation effects are less easily accommodated within an emotion-expression perspective. In particular emotion is not a sufficient condition for a corresponding “expression,” even discounting explicit regulation, and, apparently, “spontaneous ”facial movements may be facilitated by the presence of others. Further, there is no direct evidence that any particular facial movement provides an unambiguous expression of a specific emotion. However, information communicated by facial movements is not necessarily extrinsic to emotion. Facial movements not only transmit emotion-relevant information but also contribute to ongoing processes of emotional action in accordance with pragmatic theories.",

Communication is paramount. This survivor behavior is distorted in the clinical setting resulting in noncompliance, manipulation of power figures (clinical staff), and distorted understanding, both ways, of communication. Suggestions are offered on the developmental history of the patient as a survivor and how survivor behavior can be incorporated into therapeutic regimes. In line with the concept of conservation-withdrawal, the action-engagement of survivor behavior is hypothesised as being biologically based.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In New Comedy, a bride is presumed to be a virgin at the time of marriage (or, more accurately, at the time of her first marriage); if she has been violated, it is by the man who is destined to become her husband. A courtesan, on the contrary, has relations with several men, and this renders her ineligible as a conjugal partner. For the courtesan, more¬ over, love is a business, and whatever the romantic feelings that may occasionally be attributed to her, her relationships with men are in the first instance commercial. This is the basis for the common characterization of the hetaera as greedy. Marriage stands outside such mercantile transactions. Far from being acquisitive, the marriageable woman seems almost to be devoid of motives altogether.

      "abstract": "some influence -upon Lope at this time made him more conscious of the problem of the will and the fatalistic implications of predestination in the plays· The contradictions in Lope's practice and, attitudes -(between fatalism and free will, for example, or between Fortune as a servant of God'ánd Fortune as an irrational independent co- or counter-divinity) can be partly explained by the tendency 'in the comedia, as in other literature of the period, to view life successively from different perspectives. If one takes a long-range view, life is a marvelous unity of Heaven-directed order and reason, an idea often expressed by Lope's characters; in such a universe Fortune and Fate can be identified with Cod's purposes. If, on the other hand, one views life, as Lope's characters also do at times, from the blindness and isolation of the moment and the individual , it appears confused and unstable, and men seem irrational, depraved, and remote from God; Fortune and Fate then lose their divine attributes and are identified with man's corrupt nature and the undependability of life on earth, as targets for men's invectives and pessimism. The terms \"determinism\" .and \"predestination\" are used here. with no specific scientific or theological connotation, but only in the general sense of a predetermination of the events of a lifetime. 2 I am indebted to Professor Otis H. Green for a concept which helps to explain the acceptance of. such devices, the orinciple of fingimientos de poetas, which permitted the poet the license of imagining unorthodox situations and details with which to embellish his writings, not to be taken seriously by his readers. A NOTE ON CALDERÓN 'S EL ASTRÒLOGO FINGIDO by, Max Oppenheimer, Jr., Washington University, St, Louis 5, Mo, According to H. W. Hilborn (A Chronology of the Plays of D. Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Toronto, 1938, pp. 6-7 and 9-11), the versification of El Astrólogo fingido and internal evidence (the mention of an intended departure for Flanders by one of the characters is reminiscent of Calderón 's own plans to depart for the wars in the north during the period 1623-25) point to the probability that the date for this comedia is about 162U-25. Professor Hilborn used the Hartzenbusch text of this comedia (BAE, VII, 573-593) to analyze its versification. His findings are listed in the table below. Hartzenbusch established the BAE text of El astrólogo fingido mainly by combining the text of the comedia as it appears in Parte XXV de diferentes autores, Zaragoça, 1632, with the one printed in Calderón's Segunda Parte, Madrid, 16UI, thus supplying lines missing in the I632 text from the 16Ul text, and vice-versa. (See my edition of the comedia, an unpublished thesis, Univ. of South. Calif., L.A., 19U7, p. 27. I am now revising this edition for eventual publication.) the I6UI text is identical, except for a few minor emendations, with that appearing in the 1637 edition of the Segunda Parte (See HR, 19U8, XVT, 336), and we know that the difference between this latter text and the 1632 version is enormous. There are U99 verses in the 1632 text, and 206 verses in the 1637 text that are absent from the 16\"3.2 text. Despite these striking discrepancies, an analysis of the versification of each of these two texts of El astrólogo fingi.do shows essentially the same. composition as that found by Hilborn in the Hartzenbusch edition, throwing no new light on the matter.

In this essay, we take the position that “addiction” is a social construct, a term that reflects a societal convention as much or more so that its manifestation in the consensual world. Its definition differs from “expert” to “expert” and from culture to culture. Nonetheless, “addiction” (from the Latin addicre) to ecstasy is a serious mental disorder for many people, whether the ecstatic feelings are due to substances (such as alcohol) or behavior (such as gambling). We have focused on substance addiction in this essay because of the plethora of research on this topic. “Bliss” is a desirable human condition, but can be attained through spiritual practices, human relationships, and positive artistic, athletic, cognitive, and other activities where the possibility of addiction is still present but less likely to occur.",

These units can only initially develop when enabled--but not necessarily produced--by a material base of a bio-physical nature, namely the central nervous system. In short, taking but three more academic factors, images, texts, and algebra, for example, are grasped by this material base. However, it is clear that the effects produced on children (and on adults, for that matter) are not equal. Scholastic goals, however, emphasize \"fables\" and \"equations\" whereas social mediatization emphasizes \"images\" and economic mediatization \"equations\". Hence the problems of appropriation of linguistic codes. To show the danger of an imbalance in these appropriations, the concept of differential semanticization is called upon: images are over-semanticized, with identification at risk; algebra is under-semanticized, at risks of obsessionalization. Texts, themselves, call upon the imagination and not on an imaginary structure imposed by a multivocal iconic pressure nor an imaginary structure rarefied by the prevalence of systems with univocal elements. Hence the importance of reading and writing for maintaining a nondepersonalizing semiotic balance.",

      "abstract": "This chapter presents the key findings of a small research project on the structure, functions, and strategic use of angel experience narratives within the Dutch angel milieu. We found that all the angel experience narratives that we collected follow the same basic pattern: the protagonist experiences danger or distress, an angel intervenes, and the problem is solved. In many cases, the tellers additionally report conversion-like life transformation as a result of their angel encounters. Equally important as the basic structural pattern, we identified five different genres of angel experience narratives, spanning a 'hierarchy of miraculousness' from subtle 'sign narratives' in which the angels make their presence known merely through signs such as feathers to stories of lifesaving interventions and full-blown visions. What is more, the various genres can be shown to each have their particular functions within the angel milieu: subtle sign narratives, for example, steer the perceptual expectations of lay believers, whereas revelation narratives, among other things, cement the charisma of the field's religious specialists (i.e. the more or less professional angel healers and angel mediums). In the final section of the chapter, we move beyond our case study to outline a general narrative research program for the study of religion that conceptualizes religions as narrative cultures. We formulate the main tasks of such a research program and reflect on how developing it may benefit the study of religion.",

      "abstract": "In a combinatorial communication system, some signals consist of the combinations of other signals. Such systems are more efficient than equivalent, non-combinatorial systems, yet despite this they are rare in nature. Why? Previous explanations have focused on the adaptive limits of combinatorial communication, or on its purported cognitive difficulties, but neither of these explains the full distribution of combinatorial communication in the natural world. Here we present a nonlinear dynamical model of the emergence of combinatorial communication that, unlike previous models, considers how initially non-communicative behaviour evolves to take on a communicative function. We derive three basic principles about the emergence of combinatorial communication. We hence show that the interdependence of signals and responses places significant constraints on the historical pathways by which combinatorial signals might emerge, to the extent that anything other than the most simple form of combinatorial communication is extremely unlikely. We also argue that these constraints can be bypassed if individuals have the socio-cognitive capacity to engage in ostensive communication. Humans, but probably no other species, have this ability. This may explain why language, which is massively combinatorial, is such an extreme exception to nature's general trend for non-combinatorial communication.",

Thus, the complexity was stable, unsolvable, and as a result, problems arose that arose as a result of the existence of a single organism. Existence in two antagonistic, according to thinkers, forms of existence in being and in thinking. In this regard, the attempt to present the signs of the biological form of existence, which indicate that the transcendental worldview is an object of the living, in which the signs of the existence of a socio-historical nature are distinctly relevant, is relevant signs of a social-historical nature. There are biological forms in which all the necessary objects exist, as well as mutual understanding, mutual understanding, and exchange of views during the evaporation process forms of existence. The fact that the existing in this area of existence is essentially not observable indicates that the transcendental worldview cannot be justified by refuting factors, and therefore does not require evidence that their reliability has not been proved, and not only in the veracity, nor in the veracity of the outlined worldview views, there are quite significant in this area.",

The word anthropomorphism derives from Greek and, literally translated, means humanlike ( ánthrpos ) in shape or form ( morphos ). In our daily lives, we do not have different languages to describe humans versus nonhumans. Therefore, humanlike characteristics are often used in a metaphorical sense to facilitate understanding (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980). For example, we might say our car refuses to start, but this does not require that we actually think the car has ill intentions. Nevertheless, anthropomorphism may have important psychological and social ramifications. In some cases, anthropomorphic agents may be thought of as actual persons in the lives of those for whom they are real. These personified agents may be deemed to have rights, responsibilities, or the potential for social interactions.",

      "title": "Altruism And Organism: Disentangling The Themes Of Multilevel Selection Theory",
      "abstract": "The evolution of groups into adaptive units, similar to single organisms in the coordination of their parts, is one major theme of multilevel selection theory. Another major theme is the evolution of altruistic behaviors that benefit others at the expense of self. These themes are often assumed to be strongly linked, such that altruism is required for group‐level adaptation. Multilevel selection theory reveals a more complex relationship between the themes of altruism and organism. Adaptation at every level of the biological hierarchy requires a corresponding process of natural selection, which includes the fundamental ingredients of phenotypic variation, heritability, and fitness consequences. These ingredients can exist for many kinds of groups and do not require the extreme genetic variation among groups that is usually associated with the evolution of altruism. Thus, it is reasonable to expect higher‐level units to evolve into adaptive units with respect to specific traits, even when their members are not genealogically related and do not behave in ways that are obviously altruistic. As one example, the concept of a group mind, which has been well documented in the social insects, may be applicable to other species.",

Certainly one cannot elucidate the notion of linguistic meaning without reference to psychological notions; the communication-intention theorists are right about this. They are, however, wrong about which psychological notions are needed. It is not possession of the ability to (intentionally) mean something that is crucial—the possession and exercise of communication intentions. What is crucial is rather the possession of certain semantic psychological attitudes. To possess such semantic psychological attitudes (semantic attitudes for short) is to be disposed to take certain publicly observable phenomena—such as sights and sounds—as (non-naturally) meaning something. The paper argues that it is possible to describe circumstances in which one can in so doing be said to understand their meaning.",

      "title": "ECHO CHAMBERS AND EPISTEMIC BUBBLES",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Discussion of the phenomena of post-truth and fake news often implicates the closed epistemic networks of social media. The recent conversation has, however, blurred two distinct social epistemic phenomena. An epistemic bubble is a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out, perhaps accidentally. An echo chamber is a social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited. Members of epistemic bubbles lack exposure to relevant information and arguments. Members of echo chambers, on the other hand, have been brought to systematically distrust all outside sources. In epistemic bubbles, other voices are not heard; in echo chambers, other voices are actively undermined. It is crucial to keep these phenomena distinct. First, echo chambers can explain the post-truth phenomena in a way that epistemic bubbles cannot. Second, each type of structure requires a distinct intervention. Mere exposure to evidence can shatter an epistemic bubble, but may actually reinforce an echo chamber. Finally, echo chambers are much harder to escape. Once in their grip, an agent may act with epistemic virtue, but social context will pervert those actions. Escape from an echo chamber may require a radical rebooting of one's belief system.",

      "abstract": "Health and/or illness (physical, mental) are not random states that manifest themselves at the level of the human body, the expression of all lived experiences. A person's life cannot be understood only in the context of knowing life events, but also in the context of deciphering the relationships, circumstances, events in which they occurred. Traumatic experiences lived from the first years of life determine a particular path of the one who experiences them. These produce, most or time, true \"psychological chasms\" and tend to be \"filled\" with those experiences that produce immediately and, at first impression, the well-being lost following the interference with the traumatic event. Even today, there are two biased views about how addictive behaviors are inserted into people's lives. The first, and most common, view is that a person who has become addicted has made bad choices and, as a result, bears full responsibility for what is happening to them now. The second view regards addictive behavior as a disease, and therefore the disease requires drug treatment. Both perspectives exclude the human element from the dependency equation. Identifying each person's particular developmental niche provides a first step toward understanding, healing and cultivating individual and community resilience for mental health. This article presents on the one hand, a synthesis of some current perspectives regarding the understanding of the trauma-addiction dyad and, on the other hand, proposes some ways to increase individual resilience to preserve and strengthen mental health in the context of family, social and community.",

I answer by developing a social understanding of how we pursue meaning in life. True to other uses of 'meaning,' I propose, meaning in a life is communicative. If you experience your life as 'unlivable,' recovery can lie in this communicative dynamic: you regain the experience of leading your life by letting others remind you of meanings you've communicated to them in leading it. My argument works from a parallel between two dimensions in which you project an investment – a care, concern, love, or the like – when you form an intention or plan. Intrapersonally, you project your investment as communicatively intelligible to your own future self at 'plan's end.' Interpersonally, you project it as communicatively intelligible to others who might come to love this thing that you love simply because you love it, as an expression of love for you. The normativity of meaning in your life puts rational pressure on you not only to abandon investments that you cannot communicate but to experience the meaning in investments that you retain.",

Most of us would certainly tend to accept that no universally valid answer can be given to the question of what kind of human life is truly meaningful or valuable and that, because of this, people should be granted as much freedom as possible to pursue a life that best corresponds with their own personal tastes and preferences. Many would go a step further and claim that people should also be encouraged to live as much as possible according to what they have themselves chosen, and that they should give up traditional forms of life and role patterns. One aspect of this cult of individual freedom or autonomy is the idea that we should develop a critical attitude towards anything established, accepted or traditional: every form of power or authority, prevailing moral norms and educational customs, traditional role patterns, etc. A further feature of this is the tendency to describe any improvement in the fortunes of the weak, the vulnerable and the less well off as an ‘emancipation’. The idea that the poor, the handicapped and the elderly should receive more support, assistance, respect and attention is translated by the assertion that they, too, should be ‘liberated’. The ideals that we associate with words like ‘emancipation’ or ‘self-affirmation’ were at one time innovative and revolutionary, but they gradually became established as accepted ways of thinking and thus became part of a new common sense. Nowadays, anyone wanting to be provocative will attain their goal more easily by scoffing at everything falling under the rubric of emancipation than by speaking out in its defence. This fact is characteristic of an ambiguity in our culture. While the ideals of self-affirmation and emancipation enjoy enormous popularity, in certain intellectual circles they are treated with suspicion. At stake here is the general image of humanity associated with these ideals. Thinkers such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida or Baudrillard have, each in their own way, attacked the idea of the autonomous subject and stressed that people’s most intimate thoughts and desires are determined by something that transcends them: by the language they speak or the culture to which they belong. Rejecting the idea of the autonomous subject is usually one aspect of a more general critique of ideas inherited from the Enlightenment. The question whether and to what extent this critique is justified occupies a central position in many contemporary philosophical discussions, and much of what goes on in contemporary philosophy can be described in terms of the opposition between those who would defend Enlightenment ideals (often indicated by the terms ‘humanism’ or ‘liberalism’) and those who would reject or cast doubt on those ideals. What I would like to discuss here undoubtedly fits into a framework that could be called ‘antiliberal’ or ‘anti-humanist’. However, it is certainly not my intention to criticize humanism or liberalism directly and systematically. In what follows, I will attempt to show that the unity or cohesion suggested by the term ‘autonomy’ does not in fact exist. It will turn out that this term is actually associated with three ideals which are not only distinct, but which are in relations of mutual opposition or tension. In addition, I would like to develop the idea that at",

      "abstract": "Abstract The haunting metaphor is rapidly catching on in anthropology and other disciplines as a way of drawing attention to aspects of social experience that typically fall outside the scope of conventional social analysis: to feelings and experiences of loss, dispossession, unease, unfairness and injustice, regret, remorse, lack of recognition or misrecognition, and so on. Yet because many scholars contributing to the hauntology literature have unwittingly confused or failed to distinguish between the metaphorical “haunting” of past injustices and the characteristics and behaviors of actual ghosts, the fundamental issues of who is being haunted by whom, under what circumstances, and for what reasons often remain muddled or unclear. I argue that the relational aspects of haunting—the fact that some people experience ghosts and hauntings while others under the same conditions do not—suggest that analyses of the dynamic forces contributing to the emergence and disappearance of ghosts must always include a concern with the complex emotional lives of the haunted.",

They perform their duties without any interior spirit, without relish and without fruit. These are in danger of mortal sin. Sometimes they are in a state of sin without realizing it, because they never seriously enter into themselves and their examination of conscience is extremely superficial. In this state of inattention innumerable objects pass through their mind each day, their heart is carried away and seems intoxicated with the turmoil of exterior matters; it is ceaselessly deceived by the illusions of nature and the devil, and it blindly follows their impulses.",

There are, it seems to me, certain metaphors, images and dramatic situations that tend to recur when ironists, or other people writing about irony, consciously or intuitively visualize their concept of its nature. These metaphors, images and dramatic situations are often, as will be seen, variants or transformations of each other not entirely, however, for they fall into three groups or constellations of which one is much older and much richer in associations. This older archetypal image of irony can be shown to have affinities at the symbolic, hence psychological, level with the archetypal images of knowledge and power and with the related phenomena of voyeurism and sadism (in the popular senses); these all have the same very simple basic structure, which can be represented as shown in Figure 1:",

Body parts like the chest and heart are conceptualized as containers for emotion. More common is the figurative exploitation of the dynamic, changeable parts of the head, in particular the face, the eyes, and lips. No correspondence seems to hold between specific emotions and specific body parts. Most are used to refer to both positive and negative emotions, the latter found to be more frequent. Interestingly, the conceptual metaphors good is up and bad is down are not always applicable: up does not always convey good in Estonian body part expressions, but rather means activated, with either a positive or negative evaluation. It is proposed that conceptualizations are made from either an Emoter’s or an Observer’s perspective and are found to correlate with metaphorical and metonymic codings, respectively.",

      "abstract": "There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the \"symbol grounding problem\": How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. \"An X is a Y that is Z \"). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic \"module,\" however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically \"dedicated\" symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.",

      "abstract": "In The Deep History of Ourselves, Joseph LeDoux distinguishes between behavioral and physiological responses caused by the activation of defense circuits, and the emotion of fear. Although the former is found in nearly all bilateral animals, the latter is supposedly a unique human adaptation that requires language, reflective self-awareness, among other cognitive capacities. In this picture, fear is an autonoetic conscious experience that happens when defense circuit activation is integrated into self-awareness and the experience labeled with the \"fear\" concept. In this commentary I will propose a different view, in which fear is a skillful activity that we coordinate with others as our social interactions unfold in time. If this is true, two important conclusions will follow. Firstly, the relevant brain circuits we should be looking for in our theory of emotions are those involved in affective social learning, social cognition, embodied intersubjectivity, and so on. Secondly, emotions may not be uniquely human, and may be present in any creature with the right kinds of social skills required for affective enactments. Therefore, although LeDoux is right to hold that emotions are not as deep as defense circuits, they are not as shallow as other cognitively sophisticated human capacities.",

If we have suffered or expect to suffer some willful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behavior, or by some ill temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremist peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, but until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

Classical research and traditional forms are changing, and we are searching for new research and development strategies. The Star Status philosophy is viewed in a social context as a section of design process. It is part of the alternative design programme of design thinking, education and training, which also comprises Open Sphere Strategy and Authentic Design Essence. Together they create a flexible system for the action-centric design process, research and education with a spirit of avant-garde thinking. In general, this system can define Designers as Individuals (Stars) in Society Groups (Constellations); they are connected to other members by various Relationships (Status). Some stars form connections, constellations and new compositions with other stars. Through new connections, the stars in constellations create a new composition, new context, new lifestyle. The acquiring and mastering of design drawing is the most credible technique of an autonomous artistic exploration, of drawing as a way of thinking in the most natural form in the designing process, functional as technology in the Star Status Philosophy. The ability to create a visual communication language is an important part in the fusion of the Action Centric independent artistic research and development. As part of interdisciplinary experience, the acquiring and mastering the common strategy in designing process between the designer and engineer, mastering the philosophy and method of design strategy, synthesis of designer drawing and 3D environment are the basic layers of Synergic research and development Design Strategy.",

Beliefs, goals, intentions, collective intentionality, etc. play a key role in the explanation of individual and collective behaviour; these categories of intentionality are at the base of agents action plans. New properties emerge because in a context of ignorance and radical uncertainty agents form new combinations or conjectures about the future state of affairs. Thus, they discover or invent new actions and/or new goals; and/or rearrange previously existing actions and goals in a new way. A by-product of interactive deployment of intended action is the generation of new knowledge. When emergent properties - such as innovation - are generated by interactions in product markets cum interactions in knowledge production, the outcome is usually beyond agents intentionality. However, the fact that unexpected consequences arise from the interaction of plans does not eliminate the fact that its origin was intentional.",

Right parietal lesions impair body image. Left-sided neglect, anosognosia, and anosodiaphoria can arise from destruction of the hemispheric module controlling body image and the physical relation of self to the environment. Right parietotemporal lesions impair topographic orientation, the relation of the body to environmental location. Right frontotemporal lesions impair impulse control. Right temporal disorders affect the sense of the familiar and unfamiliar, evoke fear and mania, and evoke experiential phenomena. Right frontal lesions impair social behavior, impairing the relation of self to others, the social self. Whereas linguistic consciousness is a function of the left hemisphere, consciousness of the corporeal and emotional self and aspects of the social self may be a right hemisphere-dominant function.",

In the current experiment, individuals with different types of explicit afterlife beliefs were asked in an implicit interview task whether various mental state types, as well as pure biological imperatives, continue after death. The results suggest that, regardless of one's explicit reports about personal consciousness after death, those who believe in some form of life after death (and, to a certain extent, even those who do not) implicitly represent dead agents' minds in the same way: psychobiological and perceptual states cease while emotional, desire, and epistemic states continue. The findings are interpreted according to simulation constraints — because it is epistemologically impossible to know what it is like to be dead, individuals will be most likely to attribute to dead agents those types of mental states that they cannot imagine being without. Such a model argues that it is natural to believe in life after death and social transmission serves principally to conceptually enrich (or degrade) intuitive conceptions of the afterlife.",

      "abstract": "As social beings, humans will not be separated from its name a symbol of communication. Therefore, the purpose and objective of the research is to find out the symbols of communication and the meaning and message of using symbols of support communication for the persebaya among the SBK supporters community. In giving their support, this community mostly expresses it through certain symbols with their own meanings and messages. So the type of research used is descriptive qualitative using the Symbolic interactionism theory approach. Data obtained through interviews and direct observation in the field. From the results of the data obtained, it was concluded that the symbols of communication that happens or is done within the community to support SBK there are two symbols of verbal and non-verbal. Verbal symbols are used in the form of yells, songs or chants that they have created and always sung throughout the game. While non-verbal symbols there are three, namely, in the form of apparel / clothing made and worn every game. Certain facial expressions that appear or occur. And body movements that are intentionally done or occur accidentally.Sebagai makhluk sosial, manusia tidak akan terlepas dari namanya simbol komunikasi. Sebab itu, Maksud dan tujuan penelitian adalah untuk mengetahui simbol komunikasi serta makna dan pesan dari penggunaan simbol-simbol komunikasi dukungan pada persebaya dikalangan komunitas suporter SBK. Dalam memberikan dukungannya, komunitas ini kebanyakan mengungkapkannya melalui simbol tertentu dengan makna dan pesan tersendiri. Sehingga tipe penelitian yang digunakan adalah deskriptif kualitatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan teori Interaksionisme Simbolik. Data diperoleh melalui wawancara dan observasi langsung dilapangan. Dari hasil data yang diperoleh, disimpulkan bahwa simbol-simbol komunikasi yang terjadi atau dilakukan kalangan komunitas SBK dalam mendukung ada dua yaitu simbol verbal dan non verbal. Simbol verbal yang digunakan berupa yel-yel, nyanyian atau chant yang diciptakan dan selalu dinyanyikan mereka sepanjang pertandingan. Sedangkan simbol non verbal ada tiga yaitu, berupa pakaian/busana yang dibuat dan dikenakan setiap pertandingan. Ekspresi wajah tertentu yang muncul atau terjadi. Dan gerakan tubuh yang sengaja dilakukan atau terjadi secara tidak sengaja.",

      "abstract": "Not only is it weirdly hard to evaluate what you yourself look like … but it turned out that consumers’ instinctively skewed self-perception, plus vanity-related stress, meant that they began preferring and then outright demanding videophone masks that were really quite a lot better-looking than they themselves were in person. High-def mask-entrepreneurs were ready and willing to supply not just verisimilitude but aesthetic enhancement. — David Foster Wallace, Infinite Jest (148) To combat the physical and emotional effects of Zoom Face, “cosmetic injectables … give a natural, rejuvenated appearance.” — Stacey Leasca, Forbes (quoting medical aesthetician Gabby Garritano) Technological forms of life are disembedded, they are somehow “lifted out”. As lifted out, they take on increasingly less and less the characteristic of any particular place, and can be any place or indeed no place. This lifted-out space of placelessness is … characterised not so much by a multiple of identities, but by an absence of identity. Its context is no context at all … . In all cases, social interaction is on a different level from ordinary forms of life. — Scott Lash, Critique of Information (21) Introduction: Communication-Image To zoom, in its original verb form, describes a decisive movement of a body through space, as in the abrupt upward climb of an aircraft, or a modulation of the space between two bodies, as in the play between the film camera and its subject (“Zoom”). The term carries connotations of speed, distance, proximity; it is suffused with kinetic energy and intensified affection. Zoom, Inc.—the pandemic era’s prevailing video communications platform—inverts these received senses of the word, as it liquidates the body, prunes away affective charge, and promotes an insipid aesthetic of atomised talking heads, rigid grids, noise suppression, and facile customisation. Along the way, the screen experience becomes increasingly dominated by a preponderance of talk. As we acclimate more to the look and feel, and to the attendant routines of working and learning and socialising from home, the platform refashions the screen from an aesthetic surface to a channel of multimodal communication, from a vehicle for the circulation of affect to one for the circulation of verbal, visual, and text-based information. This essay takes aim at Zoom in its principle, normative form, as enterprise software developed for professional and educational uses. The ensuing critique is thus not directed at art and craft adoptions, at hobbyists, or at the many creative, experimental, or otherwise alternative deployments of the software. Rather, in enumerating some of the more numbing, oppressive features and effects of the Zoom standard, I hope to supply some basic benchmarks for what such alternative uses might strive for, beginning with a resuscitation of affect, embodiment, and aesthetic experience. For Massumi, affect derives from movements of and in the body, circumscribing a “real-material-but-incorporeal” dimension of experience (5). Affect studies, in turn, part ways with the “linguistic model” that had held sway over poststructuralist cultural theory for decades (Massumi 4). As a communications channel, Zoom dampens the affective dimension of any encounter, discouraging movement in its privileging of information exchange. (“Don’t … walk around during the class meeting”, read a multitude of college and secondary school guidelines for Zoom etiquette.) With Shannon’s classic diagrammatic model of communication in mind, we could say, on Zoom, the bodies of sender and destination are forever obscured by the mechanisms of transmission and reception. The eclipse of aesthetics and embodied affect by information in the contemporary screenscape is hardly unique to Zoom, nor is it a particularly novel trend, but one whose genealogy harks back to film newsreels and broadcast television’s nightly news. It is akin to the way the podcast has in recent years captured much of the sonic attention that had once been disposed toward music listening, or to the way, with the adoption of the PC some four decades ago, the screen has become an at-home workspace. In a pandemic year, Zoom has for many become a quintessential mediator of synchronous interaction in both work and educational contexts. In mediating two or more speaking bodies, it also mediates our relationship with ourselves, as we see ourselves speaking more closely and more often than ever before. My approach in this essay draws on critical discourse analysis, affect theory, and science and technology studies to interrogate the standard Zoom experience and its disciplinary effects. My primary case study takes the shape of auto-ethnographic exposition of Zoom teaching in a university setting. Within this framework I probe the “technological forms of life” screened on Zoom (Lash 21)—the emerging behavioural and perceptual norms, and new forms of standardised experience manufactured by and through the platform. At work, in school, and in social life, Zoom has reorganised our habits and redesigned our capacities to experience and reflect on ourselves. Through its formal constraints and basic audio-visual setup, as well as through the common practices and etiquettes in effect for business and classroom usage, Zoom extends and intensifies many trends of our algorithmically mediated scopic field: a surge in self-reflection paired with a twin expulsion of otherness and environment; an occlusion of expressive and perceptive acts by rapidly accumulating instances of communication. Fulfilling David Foster Wallace’s 1996 premonition of a videophonic culture “spiral[ling] totally out of control”, Zoom has the power to monstrously augment modes, habits, and customs of self-reflection (148). It thus makes an archetypal communications medium for our age of extreme self-concern. My analysis of Zoom—as a ubiquitous “site” for social reproduction in the classic disciplinary spaces of the school and the workplace—reveals a suite of mutations around self-self, self-other, and self-environment relations, between my body and my sense of self, and between my body and the bodies of others (Foucault, Discipline 135–169). At stake is nothing short of how we organise and narrativise our lives and the space for spontaneity, otherness, equality, and bodily autonomy therein. In the specific constellation of powers and parameters of the standard Zoom experience—the fixed close-up on the face, the constraints on gesture, the stillness and frequent mute(d)ness, and, of course, the constant glitching—subjectivity is remade around diminished affective powers and ubiquitous self-reflection. From Talking Head to Glitching Gaze: The Dispositif of the Face At work, in school, and in many social settings, the communication-image on Zoom is typically an image of a face, a few faces side by side or nested one in the other’s frame, or an entire grid of faces. The Zoom standard exemplifies what in documentary cinema is known as the talking-head format: experts and eyewitnesses are interviewed on screen, framed typically from the shoulders up and set against a generic backdrop. Whether it is Edward R. Murrow on the CBS Evening News or Edward Snowden in Citizenfour, the interviewee, as talking head, projects authority and authenticity; in the Zoom room, we are all such talking heads. While facial expressions and mise-en-scène also contribute information, the prevailing emphasis remains on the discourse issued forth from the mouth on the face. Zoom generalises the talking-head format so that, particularly during pandemic lockdowns, all our conversations, lectures, and meetings look the same, and each of our interlocutors—whether a student taking a turn to talk in class, an eminent speaker at a conference, a colleague at work, or a friend in the throes of a nervous breakdown—speaks through the visual trappings of authenticity and expertise inherited from the documentary tradition. That, through a “picture-in-picture” format, we see ourselves commanding such authority may boost the ego, fuel neuroses, or both. In his seminar on the psychoses, Lacan locates the origins of psychotic delusion in a basic feature of the relationship between language and sensation: we hear ourselves speak and, even when not speaking aloud, we continue to “hear” our thoughts as if they are speech (Lacan 161–62). Zoom propagates a potent visual supplement to this phenomenon: not only do we hear ourselves speaking, but we see ourselves speaking, too. Although Lacan ridicules those who refuse to recognise the (typically) latent psychotic in themselves, my point is not that Zoom (along with similar video-chat apps that nest a mirrored self-image in the picture of the other) is making psychotics of us all; rather, as we grow more accustomed to this view, new dimensions and experiences of subjectivity open up. Our “self-view” becomes a constituent factor in the schema of the normative subjective. In describing the solipsistic state of public discourse after a decade of social media saturation, we commonly reach for terms like disinformation, alternative facts, and fake news. In its standard, most common usages, Zoom proffers an image of ourselves to match. The platform has positioned itself as the foremost expositor of what I call the dispositif of the face. I use dispositif in Jean-François Lyotard’s sense, as a setup or trap for libidinal drives, as well as in Foucault’s sense, as a “thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble” of architectures, visibilities, and propositions that metes out “history’s destruction of the body” (Lyotard, Dispositif 246; Lyotard, Libidinal 23–25; Foucault, “Confession” 194–95; Foucault, “Nietzsche” 148; Crano 3–8). A dispositif synchronises the coordination of libidinal, corporeal, and industrial production. On Zoom, the face functions as such a dispositif, as its form appears in uncompromising close-up and interminably multiplied, and as its promise sustains social harmony and economic efficiency through an extended public health crisis and waves of state-mandated isolation. In its disembodying and “disembedding” of communication (Lash 21), Zoom crystallises the iconicity of the face, and, while an iconised and overcoded face is perhaps as old as human civilisation itself, never before has the face—not the face of a queen or a tyrant or a god, but my face and your face and any face whatsoever—been exposed up close so often to so many people. The self-care industry has been quick to respond. Glamour describes how “excessive video conferencing can trigger damaging repercussions for our mental health and our body image” and offers a series of predictable tips to stay positive and put on your best “Zoom face” (Turner). Similarly, with special attention to body-dysmorphic disorder, Vogue reports on “how staring at our faces on Zoom, is impacting our self-image” (Valenti). In classrooms, students plead to keep their cameras off, and, while some may do so simply to mask their distractedness, it would not be unreasonable to take a preponderance of black screens as an index of increasing anxieties around being seen—and seeing ourselves speaking and seeing—in this way. Elsewhere in the self-care industry, one might even get a new face. The “aesthetic doctor” Sarah Hart explains: “the increase in the use of Zoom seems to have caused a post-lockdown boom in patients seeking facial improvements. … Not only are more people getting cosmetic injectables, they’re also looking into plastic surgery … . Jowls, double chin, frown lines and lip lines are the top features people tell me they would like to correct” (Hart). In the era of the ubiquitous closeup, success and self-optimisation might hinge on the refurbishment or reconstruction of one’s own face. Coworkers, teachers, students, and even some friends are not used to seeing each other’s faces this closely, and, even though this hardly amounts to seeing each other, many are turning to Zoom Face Experts (ZFEs) for tips on (as a Forbes headline reads) “how to look and feel your best on those constant video calls” (Leasca). Although a scant few may go so far, “cosmetic injectables like wrinkle reducers and dermal fillers are a great place to start”, or so advises one of the Forbes-featured ZFEs, whose firm seeks to produce “a natural look” in “adding lost volume to improve the overall dimensions and contour of the face” (Leasca). One might reasonably contend that this has little to do with Zoom, that these cosmeticians and plastic surgeons are simply seizing the pandemic moment to ply their trade; I concede this point, but it remains subsidiary to the revelation in popular discourse of a heightened regard for self-image now that we attend meetings, classes, and social gatherings in front of a mirror. Zoom parades the face in an immobile, long-take close-up, and, in a socially competitive consumerist society, it is only natural that some in this scenario would feel compelled to “fix” their face along the lines suggested by the ZFEs quoted above. Indeed, Kember and Zylinska situate cosmetic surgery within a broader context of “makeover culture” and the neoliberal imperative of perpetual self-improvement (134–136). In this vein, face-fixing could hardly appear farther removed from the practices of posthuman metamorphosis and post-disciplinary modularity that scholars have typically invoked to think plastic surgery alongside the novel affordances of digital cultural production (Duckett 209–224; Shaviro, “Post-Cinematic” 13–15). While many have found the proverbial virtual realm to be conducive to identity play and self-transformation (e.g. Turkle, Life), I am tracking a countercurrent: Inhabiting the communication-image on Zoom, one strives to become more like oneself. Face-fixing feels as banal as changing one’s virtual background; lured by the self-expressive promise of customisation, we hollow out our contexts and lift ourselves out (Lash 21, 148), conforming ever more to our own self-identity, becoming increasingly the same. Turkle has long warned of the civilisational threats posed by digital communication technology and practice, seeing the easy affordances of text messaging and social media as so many means of sidestepping the awkward and difficult moments that make conversation meaningful and make us full participants in human sociality (Turkle, Alone; Turkle, Reclaiming). Only in face-to-face interactions, she argues, can we fully develop our empathetic powers, and, despite its highly marketable promise, Zoom comes up short (Pasternack). While Turkle roundly disputes “the idea that [Zoom] is successful communication” (Pasternack), the ZFEs contract to help one achieve a verisimilitude commensurate with the platform’s success. Despite their differences, Turkle’s cautionary work shares with the ZFEs and the Zoom marketers a paradigm-defining, all-too-human devotion to and investment in the face. As dispositif, the face is venerated and desired perhaps more than ever before, something to reveal or withhold strategically, an icon of the person, a synecdoche for the body. The larger problem for human communication is not that we see too little of the face; it is rather that we see too much, and too much of our own. As it lubricates the social and institutional machinery of capital, Zoom likewise marks a retreat into the human, a reinvestment in the dispositif of the face. It is here that we arrive at what Kember and Zylinska, in a different context, name “the limits of becoming” (136). No matter how we look or feel about our self-image (and no matter how creative or revealing or obfuscating our backgrounds), the platform will always render impossible any shared emplacement or reciprocity between self and other. This is in part because, in speaking and listening, I cannot look at another’s face and make eye contact at the same time: I can look like I am making eye contact, but to do so I must look into the camera. This is commonly recommended in professional circles. According to Forbes, “looking into the camera is the equivalent of making direct eye contact” (Goman). Turkle likewise adopts this strategy but is ultimately dissatisfied with its results (Pasternack), as we all should be. My conversation partners surely know that I am in fact not looking at them, as I gaze into the green light atop my laptop screen. The alternative is for me to look directly at the other’s face, but without looking like I am making eye contact. In one case, the other might well understand that I am looking at them, even though it does not look as if I am; in the other case, I show an effort to try to find them, to search (confusedly, or perhaps with a feigned, Forbes-inspired dose of confidence) for their eye through the tunneling eye of the camera. Either way, the contact is only ever indirect and asymmetrical. The implication is that, to Zoom, eye contact is inessential for “successful” face-to-face communication, no longer codified as part of the message. Everywhere my eye might meet the gaze of the other, it gets displaced onto the camera-eye or deflected into self-reflection. This experience—of a communicative act with all trappings of face-to-face contact but nothing of the reciprocal gaze—is only further complicated in group settings. As a teacher leading class, I frequently scan the grid of faces on my screen, out of habit, as if to simulate what in an emplaced setting would signal recognition. As I lean in, those on the other end might notice my eyes darting around my laptop screen, perhaps able to acknowledge that I am acknowledging them, but this comes through an attunement to micro-movements of the eyes rather than to my body moving through space. Without direct eye contact, there can be no genuine reciprocity between the I and the other. To Levinas, the face of the other acts as a check on my self-certainty and my otherwise limitless capacity for self-extension into the world of things. On Zoom, as the power of the other—that is, the other’s counter-power of “total resistance” (Levinas 197–98)—breaks down, the powers (as well as the psychical maladies) of the self expand. In the Zoom room, I am but a floating head, framed in close-up, consigned to the spiritlessness of indirect eye contact and hyper-mediated expression. In the Zoom room, the gaze no longer binds two or more bodies in talk; my look finds not the other but only myself looking, and so builds the infinite circuit of self-reflection. My point here is not simply to advise turning off “self-view”. Having self-view as the default alone speaks volumes about our everyday experiences of and in technoculture more broadly. Whereas media scholars have for decades been keen on the powers of digital mediation to decompose the liberal humanist individual, I see Zoom, in its standard operations, to be tacking the other way. We would do well to recall Benjamin’s observation of the dire consequences of a revolution in communications technology without a concomitant revolution in property relations (236). Zoom can afford a safe and easy means of expression, but only so long as we steer our desire for mutuality towards the platform’s own proprietary transmission and the spotlighted properties of the face. No Object, Still Life If there is anything revolutionary about Zoom, it is in its freezing up, glitching, and breaking down, which I return to below. When functioning smoothly, Zoom, at a macro level, sustains the communication and sociality essential to the maintenance and growth of capitalist institutions; at a micro level, it marks the apogee of digitally induced narcissism (Han 1–9). In the Zoom room, the other is no object; all modes of non-self get squeezed out. Neither my interlocutors nor the environment present an obstruction to my pursuit of self-regard. Zoom illustrates in real time what Han identifies in social media culture more broadly as “the expulsion of the other” (Han 40–43). The other becomes less ob-ject than ab-ject, thrown out rather than thrown in the way, their body cast aside instead of being something my body might be cast into. Kristeva explicates the abject as “not me. Not that. But not nothing, either. A ‘something’ that I do not recognize as a thing. A weight of meaninglessness that … familiar as it might have been in an opaque and forgotten life, now harries me as radically separate” (Kristeva 2). I take this to neatly capture the status of the body—my body, other bodies—in the Zoom room. In Irigaray’s work, as in Levinas’s, the other provides a necessary and healthy yet also troublesome counterweight to the gravity of sameness and self-interest that pulls so hard on modern lives. “The other interrupts the system of cross-references of my world, re-opens my horizon and questions its finality. As such, the other undoes the familiarity that was mine. The other is always a stranger who crosses the limits of my territory and upsets my habits” (Irigaray 97). As I have been charting here, this formidable otherness is perhaps not impossible but exceedingly hard to come by in the rarified air of your or my personal(ised) Zoom views, with each of us visually confined to our own box in the grid, our bodies drawn so far apart that the distance between them becomes immeasurable, dissolves, transmutes into the flattened reticulation of our inviolable compartments and our impermeable worlds. Over three-and-a-half semesters of Zoom teaching, I have regularly deployed on-the-fly polling and informal follow-up interviews to glean what students have missed most about in-person learning. The leading response has to do with the spontaneous conversations that happen right after class, rehashing a lecture or a text on the way out of the building. Another frequent response has to do with the embodied act of covering distance; students (and teachers too, I would wager) miss ranging across campus in a crowd, the collective rambling, or the commute by bike or by foot or by bus, as physical activities that are purposeful and goal-directed yet at the same time marginal and transitional, in between events or destinations, where a serendipitous encounter might prove illuminating or might even throw one off course. Again, Massumi’s framing of affect in terms of movement—“phase-shifts of the body”—provides an instructive cross-reference for our grasping the somatically restricted world of experience that Zoom has helped usher us into (5). A body moving through space is a body modulating space and modulated by its various currents and moods. In the experience of distance—which is space considered from a temporally subjective point of view, space temporalised—an affective body is made. Embedded in space, one makes oneself an affective body. In collapsing space and distance, Zoom drains affect from the body and the body from the subject, instead anchoring selfhood in the immobile, implacable form of the face. While hardly alone in doing so, Zoom expedites the ongoing unsnarling of self and other and the subsequent thickening of the former and “expulsion” of the latter (Han). In the loop of self-reflection, under the spell of the dispositif of the face, no relation between bodies can be forged. Evacuating the body from the scene—displaced from the office and the classroom as easily as it is cropped from the frame—Zoom detours us from everyday architectures of spontaneous encounter. Even with friends, our conversations—which is to say our talking, our everyday inhabitation of language—become more intentional. No longer does one bump into a colleague and strike up an exchange. Unannounced telephone calls grow increasingly rare; one sends a link or an invite in advance. Occasion for discourse becomes increasingly planned. Like language, so too our habitual actions have, in pandemic times, been reconstructed to cut out contingency. Without a commute, our arrival to work and school remains distraction-free. Chance interruptions are limited to domestic affairs: a leaky appliance, a noisy neighbor, a bothered pet. Here, getting sidetracked entails shoring up the space of the same. Otherness, in the form of the unexpected, is barred from the scene. This weeding out of randomness in everyday life occludes corporeality, dampens cultural creativity, and directs libidinal energies exclusively towards predetermined investments. Like all electronic media, Zoom promulgates an “atopic info space-time”, as it accelerates communication while promoting somatic inertia (Lash 147). In a great irony of its branding, Zoom, Inc. forecloses the very action that its eponym describes. Zoom immobilises bodies and accommodates little in the way of movement on screen. The affective intimacy of the cinematically zoomed-in close-up, for example, can be feigned but never fully achieved, as there is no initial distance that must be overcome. Nothing in the Zoom view pulls closer; nothing drifts away. There is no “swift movement” or “rapid change” (“Zoom”), no distance to cover, and neither “resonation” nor “sensation” of such (Massumi 14). Both the face in the frame and the body at the desk must tend toward stillness to minimise noise and streamline the communication. Gone are the shared sounds of the classroom, the ambient and incidental noises, the constant soundtrack of co-presence, of scores of bodies gathered in the same space: the unzipping of jackets and backpacks as students come in, the abundant small talk before class, the controlled cacophony of small-group breakout sessions, the comically overwhelming sounds of an airplane overhead or a nearby grounds crew. By contrast, the ubiquitous silence on Zoom is deadening—a ripe score to our increasingly pervasive processes of asocial reproduction. One might be prompted to recall, again noting the obvious irony, the onomatopoetic, mid-nineteenth-century origin of zoom: to make a zoom-like sound, “as made by something traveling at speed” (“Zoom”). In the soporific stillness of the Zoom classroom, there can be but an alienating silence, save the sound of my own voice, doubly discombobulating in the intermittent echoes and distortions attendant to the algorithmic compression and buffering that take the place of spatial experience. There is something lost in the way of proprioception here as well, understood as “the sensibility proper to the muscles and ligaments”, which “effects a double translation of the subject and the object into the body” (Massumi 58–9). In the classroom, my voice projects and resonates in ways that are shaped by the space; as I pace the front of the lecture hall, or around the seminar table, I get a sense for my environment in part by hearing the sound of my own voice bouncing around the room. By contrast, alone in front of the laptop camera, not only am I trapped in silence, but I am also locked in place, facing the screen. If I stray too far, or if I fail to direct my speech sufficiently towards the microphone, the communication may collapse. Those subtle sonic reverberations of the classroom permeate my sensory apparatus, register my movement, help bind me to a space, and inform my dispositions. And others hear them too, in more or less the same way, but adjusted slightly according to their relative location and orientation in the classroom. The sounds of shared spaces—and the shared sounds of a space—help fuse an ephemeral group subjectivity, a being-together in the sonic body of language. In the placeless place of the Zoom room—the room without room—the body is bound before the desk, its gestures distilled to generic icons, its broad movements reduced to micro-expressions, clicks, and swipes. One sees other spaces without hearing them or feeling them; the faces and voices issuing from them come “lifted out”, with background noise and room resonance algorithmically sifted away. In short, the success of Zoom comes at a tremendous cost to the body: Fatigue compounds. Eyes strain. Backs ache. The body itself becomes abject—that which escapes the subject but is itself neither an object nor an other—that which makes something other of the self (Kristeva 5). Conclusion: Frozen Frames Zoom abounds in aesthetically pleasing and socially creative uses, but what I have been after are the normative, standardised sorts of everyday experiences one has on the platform, in the scenarios it was designed for, and the function of those experiences in the formation of subjectivity. It is left to artists and other experimenters to expose and undermine the workings of power in the standard corporate, neoliberal modes of engagement I have been interrogating here. Short of such alternative uses of the platform, it is in the glitch—bearing witness to the cutup versions of ourselves (freezing, muting, skipping, jumping, pixelating)—that affective embodiment returns in unanticipated ways. The ZFE quoted above proclaims that, with their naturalistic injectables, “the days of frozen faces are over” (Leasca), but, if there is any universal to the Zoom experience, surely it is the intermittent lags, the regular but unpredictable freezing and glitching of voice and face. These visual stumbles reveal the duplicitous space-time of the medium: the time is no more “real” than the “room” is roomy. All the blips and glitches and frozen faces unmask the ruse of co-presence—the shared experience of temporal continuity always subject to sudden and indeterminate breakdown. In the glitch, in the moment of lag, right when the image freezes up, when a party to the conversation suddenly disappears, or when a teacher’s audio cuts out, or when you yourself keep speaking after everyone else became stuck only to realise that you are the one stuck to everyone else—in these moments of uncertainty (Will the connection resume? When? Can I quit trying to reconnect yet?), embodied experience gets a jolt; proprioception no longer divides into the rooms on the screen. So we see ourselves speaking as neve",

      "abstract": "Abstract The book discusses the diversity of mechanisms by which prey can avoid or survive attacks by predators, both from ecological and evolutionary perspectives. There is a particular focus on sensory mechanisms by which prey can avoid being detected, avoid being identified, signal (perhaps sometimes dishonestly) to predators that they are defended or unpalatable. The book is divided into three sections. The first considers detection avoidance through, for example, background matching, disruptive patterning, countershading and counterillumination, or transparency and reflective silvering. The second section considers avoiding or surviving an attack if detection and identification by the predator has already taken place (i.e., secondary defences). The key mechanism of this section is aposematism: signals that warn the predator that a particular prey type is defended. One particularly interesting aspect of this is the sharing of the same signal by more than one defended species (the phenomenon of Mullerian mimicry). The final section considers deception of predators. This may involve an undefended prey mimicking a defended species (Batesian mimicry), or signals that deflect predator’s attention or signals that startle predators. The book provides the first comprehensive survey of adaptive coloration in a predator-prey context in thirty years.",

      "abstract": "‘Self-realization’ is the development and expression of characteristic attributes and potentials in a fashion which comprehensively discloses their subject’s real nature. Usually, the ‘self’ in question is the individual person, but the concept has also been applied to corporate bodies held to possess a unitary identity. What constitutes the self’s ‘real nature’ is the key variable generating the many conceptions of self-realization. These can be grouped broadly into two types: (1) the ‘collectivist’, in which the self-realizing lifestyle, being either the same for all or specific to a person or subgroup of people, is ultimately definable only in the context, and perhaps with reference to the common purposes, of a collective social body; (2) the ‘individualist’, in which a person’s self-realization has no necessary connection with the ends of a particular community. As an ethic, self-realization can be proposed as the means to achieve a life identified as good by some criterion independent of the self-realizing process, or held to be that which actually defines the good. Its critics typically argue that human nature is such that any equation of ‘self-realization’ and ‘goodness’ is implausible or undesirable.",

      "title": "On some of the Causes of Insanity",
      "abstract": "It is not an easy matter, at least I have not found it so in my experience, when brought face to face with an actual case of in sanity, and asked to state the cause of it, to do so definitely and satisfactorily. The uncertainty springs from the fact that, in the great majority of cases, there has been a concurrence of co-operating conditions, not one single effective cause. Two persons are exposed to a similar heavy mental shock: one of them is driven mad by it, but the other is not. Can we say then that the madness has been produced by a moral cause? Not accurately so; for in the former case there has been some innate vice of nervous constitution, some predisposition of it to disease, whereby insanity has been produced by a cause which has had no such ill effect in the latter case. The entire causes have not, then, been in reality the same. And what we have to bear in mind is, that all the conditions which conspire to the production of an effect, whether visibly active or seemingly passive, are alike causes, alike agents, and that therefore all the conditions, whether they are in the patient himself or in the circum stances of life in which he is placed, which in a given case co-operate in the production of insanity, must properly be viewed as its causes. Mental derangement sometimes appears as the natural issue of all the precedent conditions of life, mental and bodily, the outcome of the individual character as affected by certain circumstances; the germs of the disease have been latent in the foundations of the character, and the final outbreak is but the explosion of a long train of antecedent preparations. In vain, then, is it in many cases to attempt to fix accurately on a single cause, moral or physical; a common mistake on the part of those, who think to do so being to fix upon what is really an early symptom of the disease as the supposed cause of it. Religion, self-abuse, intemperance, have all at times been put down as the causes of mental derangement, when they were really morbid symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Something is ’private’ if it can be known to one person only. Many have held that perceptions and bodily sensations are in this sense private, being knowable only by the person who experiences them. (You may know, it is often said, that we both call the same things ’green’; but whether they really look the same to me as they do to you, you have no means of telling.) Regarding the relation between private states and language two main questions have arisen: - Could there be a ’private language’, that is, a language in which a person communicates to themselves, or records for their own use, information about their own private states – this language being in principle incomprehensible to others, who do not know the nature of the events it is used to record. This question is primarily associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein. - Can the nature of our private states affect the meaning of expressions in the public language, that is, the language we use for communicating with each other? Or must everything that affects the meaning of expressions in the public language be something which is itself public, and knowable in principle by anyone? Michael Dummett has argued that we must accept the second of these alternatives, and that this has far-reaching consequences in logic and metaphysics.",

      "abstract": "Famine belongs to one of several divine punishments which are referred to again and again in the Hebrew Bible and throughout the Ancient Near East. Oracles and curses mention famine as a future-conditional event. This paper focuses on a subgroup of texts announcing not only famine and aggregate food-supply shortfalls but expressing the abolition of the regular order and the connection between deed and punishment (e. g., people will plant but never enjoy the fruits, they will eat but never have enough, etc.). While in the so called indictment/judgment oracles (e. g. Hos 4:10–11; Am 4:6–8; 5,10–11; Mic 6:9–16; Zeph 1:12–13) the offence has already be done, in the so called “treaty curses” the punishment will only be fulfilled in case of violation of the inscription (Statue from Tell Feḫerīye; Bukān Stela), the treaty (Sfīre Stela) or the covenant (Lev 26:14–39; Deut 28:15–44). In either case the emotion of fear plays an important part. These dystopian texts (“futility curses”) convey a warning predicting a bleak future and in some cases the expectation of the future even surpasses what has been experienced in the past by stressing the futility of action.",

      "abstract": "What does it look like to cultivate a community in right relationship with God? In taking the focus off individual members and placing it on the community itself, we recognize that the whole of a university is greater than the sum of its parts, and that individual parts are repeatedly and continually shaped and defined by the whole. Being in right relationship with God begins with acknowledging our longings to be loved, to be known, and to belong in ways encouraging us to put ourselves intentionally and consistently in God’s gaze of love. Coming before God empty-handed and agenda-less, rather than starting another discipleship program or Bible Study, helps us lean into God’s love already at work—common grace. Gratitude flows from opening our eyes to the wonder of God’s sustaining love active around us. As we gaze at God, who is gazing at us, we are transformed—saved from envy, pettiness, selfishness, and sense of entitlement. Transformation begins with grace, where the response is a gratitude that moves back to God and is expressed in love of neighbor—love of all created things, both seen and unseen, held together by Christ. This movement of God in our college communities is cultivated by a shared identity as a Christian community, by seeing and knowing each other, being seen and known, using chapel as a Holy Place, and turning our love outward.",

According to Lehman and Ramil (chapter 1 of [1]), the term evolution reflects a process of progressive, for example beneficial, change in the attributes of the evolving entity or that of one or more of its constituent elements. What is accepted as progressive must be determined in each context. It is also appropriate to apply the term evolution when long-term change trends are beneficial even though isolated or short sequences of changes may appear degenerative. For example, an entity or collection of entities may be said to be evolving if their value or fitness is increasing over time. Individually or collectively they are becoming more meaningful, more complete or more adapted to changing environment. Our understanding of the term related to the workshop theme covers the following key aspects: • Modification, change, progress, extension over time • State of an artefact at different points of time • Models change: dynamic versus static • Evolution versus revolution while revolution means the replacement of an existing system by new one",

Disorientation also impaired the judgment of changes to a scene after viewer movements, suggesting a similar egocentric updating process.

      "title": "Caring is costly: People avoid the cognitive work of compassion.",
      "abstract": "Compassion-the warm, caregiving emotion that emerges from witnessing the suffering of others-has long been considered an important moral emotion for motivating and sustaining prosocial behavior. Some suggest that compassion draws from empathic feelings to motivate prosocial behavior, whereas others try to disentangle these processes to examine their different functions for human prosociality. Many suggest that empathy, which involves sharing in others' experiences, can be biased and exhausting, whereas warm compassionate concern is more rewarding and sustainable. If compassion is indeed a warm and positive experience, then people should be motivated to seek it out when given the opportunity. Here, we ask whether people spontaneously choose to feel compassion, and whether such choices are associated with perceiving compassion as cognitively costly. Across all studies, we found that people opted to avoid compassion when given the opportunity, reported compassion to be more cognitively taxing than empathy and objective detachment, and opted to feel compassion less often to the degree they viewed compassion as cognitively costly. We also revealed two important boundary conditions: first, people were less likely to avoid compassion for close (vs. distant) others, and this choice difference was associated with viewing compassion for close others as less cognitively costly. Second, in the final study we found that with more contextually enriched and immersive pleas for help, participants preferred to escape feeling compassion, although their preference did not differ from also escaping remaining objectively detached. These results temper strong arguments that compassion is an easier route to prosocial motivation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

Second, it is proposed that humans, but not other primates, understand the causal and intentional relations that hold among external entities. In the physical domain only humans understand causal forces as mediating the connection between sequentially ordered events; in the social domain only humans understand the behavior of others as intentionally directed and controlled by desired outcomes.

Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance. Like the other types of stigma, undesirable physical characteristics isolate some individuals, disqualifying them from “full social acceptance” (p. 1). Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the non‐stigmatized is often awkward and uncertain. Tension is manifest in people's tendency to avoid eye contact, make guarded references to the stigma, or avoid everyday words that suddenly become taboo; it leads both parties to consider avoiding or withdrawing from encounters.",

      "title": "Illness and Innocence",
      "abstract": "You have the flu? How did you get it?” The simple medical answer is, “I was attacked by a flu virus.” Ah yes, but what did you do that gave the virus the opportunity to attack you? There is always a way to wring at least a little blame and guilt out of an illness. Perhaps you haven’t been eating well, taking the right vitamin supplements, keeping your stress level down, or simply avoiding others who have the flu.It’s easy to extend the list of possible missteps in a spiritual direction: You’re sick? You must have done something to separate yourself from God, spirit, good karma, or the life-sustaining force of the universe and now you’re paying the price. The link between misconduct and medical consequence is built into the very language we speak; words such as “blind” and “sick” not only describe a physical condition but also point metaphorically to wrong behavior. The word “ill” derives from the Middle English “ille,” meaning evil or wicked.The association between illness and punishment exists in multiple languages and is deeply embedded in many of the world’s cultural and religious traditions. Judaism and Christianity, for example, commend kindness to those who suffer, but such sympathy is often compounded with disapproval. The Torah, for example, links piety to health and links impiety to suffering and death, claiming, “If you do not obey the Lord, your God . . . the Lord will strike you with consumption, fever, illnesses with burning fevers” (Deuteronomy 28:22). Jesus, following the healing he performed at Bethesda, remarks, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you” (John 5:14).The Qur’an similarly asserts that human beings are responsible for their own misfortune: “Whatever of good befalls you, it is from Allah; and whatever of ill befalls you, it is from yourself” (Qur’an, Surah an-Nisa’ verse 79). Some forms of Buddhism attribute sickness and suffering to unrighteous behavior in a past life or in this one. According to Tibetan lama Sogyal Rinpoche, for example, “Whatever is happening to us now mirrors our past karma.”None of these faith traditions attributes all illness to wrong thoughts or actions; the illness and poverty visited upon Job, for instance, are not caused by anything he has done, and God admonishes Job’s friends for assuming that somehow he must be to blame for his own suffering. And, while it’s easy to find religious texts that attribute illness to sinfulness and portray God as a punitive figure, there exists in these scriptures as well a counter-tradition that associates illness not with divine retribution, but with the inherent vulnerability of being human. The Book of Isaiah, for example, suggests that our lives are fragile as blades of grass and that illness should be met with compassion and all the support we can give.This counter-tradition provides a foundation for a nondualist, integrative approach to health and healing that views the body in its wholeness and interconnection with all life. The human body is at once astonishingly resourceful and inherently vulnerable — and it is never “fallen,” alien, shameful, or mechanical. Perceiving human beings as embedded in nature, not as masters over it, unhinges the traditional Cartesian binaries of mind and body, self and other, health and sickness, and reward and punishment. Mediation of these opposites becomes possible within a seamless reality that at once enables and constrains the scope of our actions.Buddhism approaches health and healing in this way, recognizing that aging and illness, like birth and growth, are integral to the human condition. Our bodies are subject to laws (niyama in Pali) of physical and biological determination that interact with, but are relatively independent of, human purpose, will, and action (karma). Illness, then, is not blameworthy any more than health is praiseworthy. Like the proverbial eddies in a river and passing clouds in the sky, we arise, reside in the world for a brief time, and then vanish. Yet we can make the most of that brief time and cherish this wonderful thing called life!People who are moderately healthy are apt to assume that in the normal course of their lives and, despite missteps here and there, they are doing their part, and life will continue to meet them halfway. When serious illness strikes, however, and this illusion collapses, our ability to respond in a thoughtful way may get trampled on by the way we feel inside, and we may imagine that somehow life or destiny has condemned us and cast us aside.Replacing the traditional dualism of spirit and flesh with a more unified view does not always lead to more charity and forgiveness but can actually intensify negative self-judgment and guilt. For if body and mind are one, then does not a “fault” in the body signify a fault in the mind as well? Thus we arrive at a view not so far removed from the punitive ideas of the past: something is profoundly wrong with those who fall ill; removed from grace, they fall and fail.The view of illness as punishment is reinforced within a culture that regards health and happiness as the inevitable outcomes of an optimistic frame of mind. Faith is packaged as a promise to overcome human limitation altogether and becomes, as it were, a magic carpet that sails over the human condition and conveys the believer to a land of boundless wealth and health. “We are Creators of the Universe,” proclaims life coach Kate Corbin. “Quantum physics takes a spiritual perspective in which there are no separate parts, in which everything is fluid and always changing. . . . As we focus our thoughts on what we want to attract, we can literally call into existence whatever we desire.”Such spiritual counsel is commercially successful, but how well does it work? Author and political activist Barbara Ehrenreich points out that the United States, home-land of the prosperity and happiness gospel, accounts for two-thirds of the global consumption of antidepressants and is ranked twenty-third among nations in self-reported happiness. “How can we be so surpassingly ‘positive’ in self-image,” Ehrenreich asks, “without being the world’s happiest and best off people?” In the United States, “a land of opportunity,” neither mainstream nor New Age religion solves life’s problems for most people.The flip side of proverbial American optimism is this country’s repudiation of those who do not pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. Success and health are thought to result from sincere effort and the right mindset. So being ill, like being poor, gets blamed on a failure of individual initiative.Jimmie Holland, a psychiatrist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York quotes a patient expressing precisely this mindset: “I know I have to be positive all the time and that is the only way to cope with cancer — but it’s so hard to do. I know that if I get sad, or scared or upset, I am making my tumor grow faster and I will have shortened my life.”Dr. Holland comments: “How did this phenomenon of blaming the patient for the disease come about? It undoubtedly is related to the fact that cancer has been a mystery for so long, as to both cause and cure. When we know little about something, we become even more frightened by it and develop myths to try to explain it.”Over the past several centuries, we have brought many illnesses within the scope of medical science and have come up with effective remedies. So why would anyone today attempt to account for illness in terms of destiny or retribution? One reason is that so many chronic physical conditions still baffle the medical profession and leave patients feeling helpless. Viewing illness as a kind of punishment is one way of bringing it within the scope of explanation and possible control. We human beings are infinitely resourceful meaning-making machines, and if necessary we’re willing to reach beyond the boundaries of medical science in pursuit of answers.Moreover, the accounts of illness that medical science gives are, in a way, ultimately unsatisfying, because they don’t adequately explain why a particular person falls ill. Suppose for example that my doctor tells me that I have an incurable cancer caused by a tumor whose growth is ravaging my body. That news just raises the next question: why have I been cursed with a body that falls prey to such ravaging? Even if my cancer was environmentally caused, I still don’t understand why my body in particular has turned out to be so vulnerable to an environmental toxin. No matter how elaborate any explanation may be, it halts at the doorstep of the question, “Why me?” Wrestling with this question, the mind sometimes comes up with a facile answer such as “This was meant to be” or “Somehow, I deserve this.”The connections we make between illness, responsibility, and self-esteem are often conflicting, even tortured, ones. Understanding our own contributions to illness can, of course, help us find a way to get well. Sometimes these contributions are collective ones. For example, humans are poisoning the environment to the point that it increasingly endangers us — hence we “reap what we sow.” Karma, understood as an account of social consequences, expresses the same insight. But when we regard ourselves individually as tainted or cast into a spiritual shadow, then our search for meaning is stretching beyond its plausible reach.When we fall seriously ill, we may yet retain (or discover!) a sense of gratitude for the body’s healing power, for the health care we receive, for the company of those dear to us, and for the wider world that sustains us all. On the other hand, illness can lead us to feel terribly alone, bereft of any sense of community, of protection from harm, and even of a sense of continuity between today and tomorrow. Humbled, we take the hand of a beloved, walk along a beach, meditate in a cathedral, or play with a child. In choices like these (along with good health care) may lie our best support.Going forward with our lives in this way does not signify resignation to a medical condition — or, for that matter, to any unacceptable situation in the world around us. Many Tikkun readers will be familiar with the famous first verse of theologian Reinhold Niebuhr’s “Serenity Prayer,” written during World War II:Vast and life giving universe, grant me theserenity to accept the things I cannot change;courage to change the things I can;and wisdom to know the difference.Less well-known is the prayer’s second verse, adapted as follows:Living one day at a time, taking,as have wise sages of old, this fallen worldas it is, while acknowledging the distancebetween this and our true potential,may I be reasonably happy in this life,within this mysterious cosmos,abiding in this understandingas long as consciousness allows.Amen.",

We start from some well-known processes, such as Young's double-slit experi- ment and EPR, in order to extend relevant feedback processes and nonlocal co- herence to living organisms and their influence on the environment. 3. We explain how retroaction emanating from living organisms may take the shape of goal orientation and make psychokinesis (PK) and clairvoyance easier to understand. We discuss concrete models of PK and clairvoyance and of strik- ing coincidences and telepathy. 4. Our physical model joins with the observational that dominates in professional parapsychology. 5. We investigate how far such a model implies humankind to be a four- dimensional organism up to a certain degree, taking into account hitherto un- known interindividual unconscious communications. 6. In all, our theory implies a change of paradigm, which also leads to an integra- tion of deterministic God does not play dice and antireductionist A micro- process acts as a whole. That is, it introduces nonlocal determinism in which the psychological dimension is inherent.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There can be no happy outcome in the contemporary debate that pits the priority of individual fulfillment against more traditional claims about the distinctive benisons of shared sources of meaning. This is, at least partly, because there are at least two different kinds of human flourishing, each one being raised up by one side or the other as the comprehensive human good. One kind of flourishing involves the distinctive development of what is unique to each individual agent as irreplicable subject. Although the total content of our identities may be ultimately unknowable,1 most advocates of this view allow agents some substantive insights into their personalities—enough, in any case, to give determinate content to notions of self-interpretation. Another kind of flourishing stems from what given communities take human beings to be in some universal sense (given human nature, basic human capabilities, and so on). The successful formation of communally valued character traits is thought to enable participants to fulfill the highest possibilities afforded by that (or any) community’s way of life. Both forms of flourishing represent very significant goods, and both are, in my judgment, indispensable to a nuanced understanding of the fullest human potential. To slight either, as both sides of the contemporary debate slight one or the other, is not only to impoverish ethical reflection but also to falsify human experience.",

      "abstract": "Empirical and observational studies of animal cogni-\ntion will truly benefit if different behavioural manifes-\ntations of higher cognitive processes can be defined\nfunctionally. This is vitally important because, when\nstudying animals, cognition has to necessarily manifest\nin behaviour for it to be tractable, and the performance\nof such behaviour, in turn, needs to be unambiguously\nascribed to an effect of particular cognitive processes.\nOne theoretical framework to investigate cognition in\nanimals in terms of mentalistic notions is that of the\nintentional stance, which assumes that each individual\nis an intentional system capable of mental states like\nbeliefs, desires and emotions. To attribute such mental\nstates to both oneself and to others is to have what has\nbeen termed a theory of mind. Social primates appear\nto be knowledgeable about one another's behaviour to\ndifferent extents. But do they know as much about one\nanother's beliefs and intentions? Are they adept at\nrecognizing the similarities and differences between\ntheir own and others' states of mind? Attribution of\nmental states to other individuals could manifest itself\nin diverse situations as, for example, when individual\nanimals closely observe the actions of others, when\nthey interact competitively, or when they deceive each\nother in the social sphere. Such behavioural constructs\nneed to be analysed carefully in order to ascertain\nwhether true higher-order intentionality can indeed\nbe invoked as underlying mechanisms governing these\nacts.

But the socio-cultural world of everyday activity often presents a fragmentary and irresoluble array of experience which seemingly prevents this resolution. At the root of this fragmentation is not, however, the experiences themselves, but rather a lack of understanding concerning human cognition and consciousness. Without clarifying the possibilities of human intellection in the constitution of consciousness, we will remain at a disadvantage in the pursuit of coherent personal identities.

A number of citations display the different features salient to each of these two lines of interpretation. It is argued that, for some “singularities”, which take themselves and their powers and properties to be self-sufficient and self-legitimating, exposure to the “world” is in practice morally reductive or destructive. In other “singular” cases, such exposure amounts to, and offers an understanding of, Shakespearean versions of protagonism, heroism, and empathetic charm.",

      "title": "Accounting for Spiritual Well-Being: God Wins over Other Transcendents",
      "abstract": "At our very core, human beings are spirit; we have a soul, which comprises mind, will and emotions; and we live in a body. These aspects of humans interpenetrate each other. Neither spirit nor mind can be seen physically. However, various properties or behaviours can be attributed to these aspects of our beings. For example, spiritual well-being is reflected in the quality of relationships that people have in up to four areas of life. In a study in which 257 measures of spirituality, spiritual well-being (SWB) and related measures were evaluated by the author, 86% opted for items reflecting relationship with self, 53% for relationship with others, 18% for relationship with nature/environment, and 47% for relationships with God or the Transcendent Other. All spirituality/well-being measure studies except mine record only respondents' lived experiences. The Spiritual Health and Life Orientation Measure that I propose differs since it elicits each person's ideal regarding relationships in four areas of SWB, against which their actual relationships (lived experiences) are compared. Most people agree that relationships with the self, others and nature express aspects of SWB, but relationship with God/Transcendent is considered controversial. My research, however, has shown that relating with God provides greatest explanation for variance in SWB. As such, it is the most important one for SWB, which raises concerns about half of the existing spirituality measures. The research described in this chapter provided 18 alternative Transcendents from which respondents could choose 'some-One or some-Thing that influences life beyond the human and natural worlds.' A 19th alternative, 'not an area in which I believe' was also provided. A web survey sent to 600 people worldwide elicited 453 responses. The 19 alternatives for Transcendent were compressed into four categories – theistic, other religious, non-religious and not believe. Relating to God (theistic) was shown to significantly enhance people's relationships with self and others, which was not so for other Transcendents, hence the title of this chapter.",

Theorists of crosscultural exchange like Raimundo Panikkar have argued that instead of projecting oneself into the other party or absorbing it into a system of one’s own devising that one should be open to something completely new and different in the other culture.

      "abstract": "It is plausible that current generations owe something to future generations. One possibility is that we have a duty to not harm them. Another possibility is that we have a duty to protect them. In either case, however, to satisfy the duties to future generations from environmental or political degradation, we need to engage in widespread collective action. But, as we are, we have a limited ability to do so, in part because we lack the self-discipline necessary for successful collective action. Given that having an obligation hinges on being able to satisfy it, the apparent duty to future generations is at odds with our apparent inability to satisfy it. Thus, we either need to rethink our duties to future generations or rethink the nature of our abilities. I argue in this chapter that we should rethink the nature of our abilities. Specifically, we should enhance our self-discipline, which is distinct from enhancements of motivation, judgment, or emotion. Even the most intelligent, motivated, and empathetic actor is likely to slip up, which encourages others to withdraw their cooperation. Without the necessary self-discipline to sustain our public cooperative behavior, collective action is likely to fail, leaving us with one alternative: to abandon our duties to future generations.",

After all, when we ascribe thoughts and feelings to another person, it seems that all we have by way of supporting evidence is what we observe, namely his external behaviour.

Humans have always estimated the risks of their actions or inactions in making personal decisions.

      "title": "The Pultibec System for the Medical Assessment of Handicapped Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The Pultibec System was evolved as an attempt to fulfil the recognised need for a global, yet concise, system for coding the difficulties of children with multiple handicaps in functional terms. The child's individual functional capacities are placed under eight main headings (in English the code letters of these headings form the term ‘Pultibec’). These eight headings embrace four mainly physical qualities , i.e.: P = Physical capacity (endurance and general health) U = Upper limbs (divided into hand—H, arm—A, right and left) L = Locomotion (divided into right and left lower limbs) T = Toilet and four qualities mainly of behaviour and communication , i.e.: I = Intelligence B = Behaviour E = Vision (Eyes) (divided into right eye—E and left eye—E) C = Communication (divided into hearing—H and speech—S). Each of the above qualities and their subsidiaries is divided into 6 main grades, but in relation to hand, arm and lower limb, 5 additional intermediate grades were found necessary. Generally speaking, grade I denotes complete normality in every respect, grades 2–5 progressively poorer function and finally grade 6 which denotes that function in that quality is virtually absent. When doing the Pultibec there are 114 possible grades under the 14 ‘qualities' to be considered during a medical examination. In practice, the appropriate grade is often obvious and the system is much quicker than it would first appear to be on paper. In contrast, when reading a Pultibec, only 14 ‘qualities' under the 8 main headings have to be read and, as the majority are likely to be normal, the number actually needing perusal is far less, rendering its interpretation a relatively quick task. The Pultibec system is an attempt to translate the complexities of medical terminology and case note‐taking, into a common language which is concise and easily understood in functional terms as between medical practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, education officers, teachers, psychologists, youth employment officers, employers and last, but by no means least, the parents of the handicapped child. RÉSUMÉ Le système ‘Pultibec’ a été développé pour tenter de remédier au manque évident d'un code en termes fonctionnels, complet et pourtant concis, desdi fficultés des enfants atteints de multiples handicaps. Les capacités fonctionnelles propres à chaque enfant sont rangées en 8 chapitres principaux (les initiales des titres de ces chapitres en Anglais forment le mot Pultibec). Ces 8 titres comprennent: 4 qualités essentiellement physiques, à savoir: P = Physical capacity (capacité physique), endurance et état général U = Upper limbs (membres supérieurs), divisé en bras A et main H, droit et gauche L = Locomotion (locomotion), divisé en membres inférieurs, droit et gauche T = Toilet (habitudes d'hygiène) et 4 qualités essentiellement de comportement et de communication, à savoir: I = Intelligence (intelligence) B = Behaviour (comportement) E = Vision (Eyes) (vision, yeux), divisé entre oeil droit E et oeil gauche E C = Communication (communication), divisé en ouïe H et diction S. Chacune des qualités mentionnées plus haut et de leurs subdivisions est estimée par 6 cotes principals, mais pour la main, le bras et les membres inférieurs 5 cotes intermédiaires ont dûêtre ajoutées. D'une façon générale la cote 1 dénote la normalité complète sous tous les rapports, les cotes 2 à 5 une fonction progressivement apprauvie, et, finalement, la cote 6 dénote la perte virtuellement totale de la fonction. 114 cotes possibles rangées en 14 ‘qualités' sont à considérer au cours de l'examen médical par le Pultibec. En pratique, la cote appropriée est souvent évidente et le système est bien plus rapide qu'il n'apparait à première vue sur le papier. Par contre, à la lecture du Pultibec on n'a à lire que 14 ‘qualités' rangées en 8 chapitres et, comme la majorité risque bien d'être normale. le nombre qui demande réellement attention est moindre, ce qui fait de l'interprétation une besogne relativement rapide. Le système Pultibec est une tentative de traduction des complexités de la terminologie médicale et des notes d'observation d'un cas en un language commun, concis et facilement compris en termes fonctionnels par médecins, infirmières, physiothérapistes, éducateurs, instituteurs, psychologistcs, personnel des bureaux de placement des jeunes, employeurs, et, cités les derniers mais certainement pas les moins importants, les parents de l'enfant handicapé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Das ‘Pultibec’ System wurde erfunden, um dem allgemeinen Bedarf, einer auf der ganzen Welt gültigen einfachen Verzeichnisweise der Schwierigkeiten von Kindern mit multiplen Behinderungen in funktioneller Terminologie nachzukommen. Die einzelnen funktionellen Fähigkeiten des Kindes wurden unter acht Haupttitel (im Englischen formen die Anfangsbuchstaben das Wort ‘Pultibec’) gegliedert. Diese acht Titel treffen auf vier hauptsächlich körperliche Eigenschaften zu, d.h.: P = Physical capacity (körperliche Fähigkeit) Ausdauer und Allgemeinzustand U = Upper limbs (obere Glieder) eingeteilt in Hand‐ H, Arm=A, rechts &amp; links L = Locomotion (Fortbewegung) eingeteilt in rechts &amp; links der unteren Glieder T = Toilet (Toilet‐Training) und vier hauptsächlich Verhaltungs—und Umgangsfähigkeiten, d.h.: I = Intelligence (Intelligenz) B = Behaviour (Benehmen, Verhaltung) E = Vision (Eyes)—Augenvision, eingeteilt in rechtes Auge = E, und linkes Auge = E C = Communication (Umgansfähigkeit) eingeteilt in Hören = H, und Sprache = S. Jede dieser Eigenschaften und ihre Nebengruppen werden in sechs Hauptstufen gegliedert, jedoch war es notwendig, in Bezug auf Hand, Arm und die unteren Glieder, fünf zusätzliche Zwischenstufen zu setzen. Im Allgemeinen bezeichnet Stufe No. 1 einen vollkommenen Normalzustand in jeder Beziehung, die Stufen 2–5 steigernd verschlechterte Funktion, während die letzte Stufe (No. 6) einen Zustand bezeichnet, bei dem die Funktion praktisch fehlt. Bei Gebrauch des ‘Pultibec’ Systems ist es möglich, 114 Stufen in den 14 ‘Fähigkeiten’ während der medizinischen Untersuchung zu unterscheiden. In der Praxis, ergibt sich die passende Stufe meistens leicht und man kann das System viel schneller anwenden, als die Beschreibung auf dem Papier andeutet. Hingegen ist es nur nötig 14 ‘Fähigkeiten’ unter den acht Haupttiteln zu lesen und, da die Mehrzahl davon normal sein werden, ist die eigentliche Anzahl, die zu ermessen ist, eine viel kleinere, was die Deutung eine verhältnismässig leichte Aufgabc macht. Mit dem ‘Pultibec’ System wird ein Versuch gemacht, die Schwierigkeiten der medizinischen Terminologie und des Annotierens der Fälle, unter einen gemcinsamen Nenner zu bringen, in einer Sprache, die einfach und leicht verständlich im Bezug auf funktionelles, für Mediziner, Krankenpflegepersonal, Jugendfürsorger, Arbeitgeber und schliesslich auch und ebenso wichtig, für die Eltern des behinderten Kindes geeignet ist.",

      "abstract": "Body language expresses a type of non-verbal communication that depends on body movements, such as: facial expressions, movements, and various gestures made by a person, and they are used consciously or unconsciously sometimes, and usually these physical signals accompany a spoken message, or are It is used instead of speaking, and this language is greatly noticed by others, because it is more honest than verbal communication. Body movements must often be identical with the words that accompany them, and when these signs do not match the words that come out with them, there becomes a contradiction between what the person says. And what he means, which provokes others to question his meaning again.Although there are some common gestures, body language differs from one person to another. Each body has its own language, which is called the \"standard.\" It is simply the natural state of a person in which he is, far from any kind of pressure, fear, anxiety, Sadness and all the factors that may lead him to hide a certain truth or feelings. The process of analyzing body language is the process of comparing the rest of the person's behavior and this standard that we draw through our knowledge of the person.",

      "abstract": "The Argument Pain has important biomedical socioanthropological, semiotic, and other facets. In this contribution pain and the experssion of pain are looked at from the perspective of evolutionary biology, utilizing, among others, cross-cultural data from field work in Melanesia. No other being cares for sick and suffering conspecifics in the way humans do. Notwithstanding aggression and neglect, common in all cultures, human societies can be characterized as empathic, comforting, and promoting the health and well-being of their members. One important stimulus triggering this caring response in others is the expression of pain. The nonverbal channel of communication, particularly certain universal — i.e., culture-independent facial expressions, gestures, and body postures, convey much of the message from the painstricken person to the group. These behaviors signal the person's physical and psychical pain, sadness, grief, and despair in ways very similar to the signs given by infants and small children: the body loses tonus and sinks or drops to the ground, the gestures are those of helplessness. Pain and grief may be so strong that control is lost not only over the body's posture but also over the mind's awareness. In such cases the afflicted person may carry out actions endangering himself or others. In general, these behavior patterns resemble those of infants in situations of distress and danger, and it is not surprising that the response of the members of the group is basically parental: taking care, assisting and consoling. Perceptive and behavioral patterns which developed in the course of avian and mammalian phylogeny to serve the well-being of the young have proven, as was shown by Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1989), to be powerful building blocks for actions in other spheres of human interaction. Love is one such field, the reactions to a conspecific suffering pain is another.",

      "abstract": "The experience of confinement and the current distancing measures keep showing up the paradoxes of distance, its constraints and its resources. Social distancing mobilises a number of technological, physical and semiotic mediations. In this way social distancing makes us see how presence is constructed, thus revealing the paradox that presence is only the effect of the organisation of several distances. Presence is always an effect of distance. Presence is the effect of differences, mediations, distances, which as a whole constitute what I call ‘play’ (or jeu), in the French sense of the word il y a du jeu, or the notion of play in terms of having slack or space to play with, meaning that there is a gap, an interstice, a delay. In order to have presence, you have to be able to create the conditions for this being ‘in between’, and this is exactly what the social uses of digital technology do. There is play, and presence consists in the harmonisation –always laborious and never finished– of these spatio-temporal disjunctions.",

      "title": "Appearance and culture: oral pathology associated with certain \"fashions\" (tattoos, piercings, etc.).",
      "abstract": "Humans are characterized by a compulsive tendency to distinguish themselves from the rest: differences in clothes, hairstyle or \"decorative\" details are used to this effect, based on highly diverse criteria. Such differentiating practices may be aimed at identification with a certain ideological group, for example, or with a concrete \"fashion\", and involve the use of jewelry, clothes, unusual attire, hairstyles, mutilations, etc. In this context, the present review addresses certain aspects of mutilation practices from both the general and specifically dental perspectives. Mutations imply permanent or lasting sectioning or lesions of a part of the body, and comprise skeletal deforming, dental mutilations, circumcision, ablation of the clitoris, scarification, tattoos, and perforations (particularly of the soft tissues). In this sense, tattoos and perforations or piercings are popular -- particularly among adolescents. This trend may be interpreted as a form of communication, identity expression, or as a type of body cult (i.e., so-called \"body art\"). Such mutilating practices reflect different motivations including fashion, rebelliousness, differentiation, sexual motives, the remembering of events, physical sensations, and ethnic or tribal influences. However, these practices can cause complications such as infections, laceration and soft and hard tissue damage, hypersensitivity reactions and other alterations of variable severity. Under these premises, questions are raised concerning the competence of those who perform these mutilations, the preventive measures adopted, and the legal conditions under which tattoos and piercings are made in our society.",

The person feels a sense of internal dirtiness, beneath the skin, not localized, evoked, or intensified by images, memories, or thoughts about the violation and/or the violator. The violator is the central, most intense contaminant. The basis of the contamination is obscure and perplexing because it is not obviously linked to common sources of dirtiness, and the human origin of the disorder is not recognized. The feelings of contamination are unique to the affected person. Objects and people can appear to be clean but feel dirty. Washing, even compulsively, is ineffective and it is difficult ever to feel completely clean. Usually there is a moral element in mental contamination.",

His description of the encounter between torturer and tortured victim includes no description of the victim's being as hands or instruments of pain lay into his flesh, nor of the torturer in tactile contact with the victim. Instead, the encounter is used to depict the torturer's vulnerability to being rendered a being-for-others as he becomes aware of the gaze of the victim (Sartre 1966: 525-7). In Nausea, the contact with the world is a repeated example of the horror of the world, our encounter with its brute being and contingency. In Being and Nothingness, tactile encounters with the in-itself (my hand engulfed in honey, for example) are again depicted in negative terms and serve as a metaphor for how the for-itself is threatened with engulfment by the in-itself (Sartre 1966: 775).",

      "title": "The Most Influential Theories of Second Language Acquisition in the 20th Century",
      "abstract": "1. IntroductionTheories of second language acquisition are various theories and hypotheses in the field of second language acquisition about how people learn a second language. Research in this field is closely linked to several disciplines such as linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and education. Although second language acquisition is an interdisciplinary field and the precise starting date is really hard to pin down, in the 1950s and 1960s the idea that language teaching methods had to be justified in terms of an underlying learning theory was well established, since the pedagogic reform movements of the late 19th century at least.The 1950s and 1960sThe advocates of behaviorism (Bloomfield, 1933; Skinner, 1957; Thorndike, 1932; Watson 1924) see language learning like any other kind of learning as the formation of habits. Behaviorism is a worldview that operates on a principle of stimulus-response. All behaviors are caused by external stimuli (operant conditioning) and can be explained without the need to consider internal mental states or consciousness. In such a view a learner is essentially passive responding to environmental stimuli. The learner starts offas a clean slate (i.e., tabula rasa) and behavior is shaped through positive and negative reinforcement. Behaviorism rejects structuralism and is an extension to Logical Positivism.From this point of view the process of learning a first language is relatively simple: a set of new habits should be learnt as children learn to respond to stimuli in their environment. However, it is not the case when it comes to learning a second language since a set of well-established responses exists in our mother tongue. The second language learning process therefore involves replacing those habits by a set of new ones. The point is that the old L1 habits interfere with this process, either helping or inhibiting it. L2 structures, then, which are different from L1s, are difficult to learn. The logical outcome of such a view was the work termed as Contrastive Analysis which concentrated on areas of difference in the learning process. There are certain pitfalls attributed to behaviorism, for example the production of novel utterances which have never been heard by children, lacking of some categories in production (e.g. function words) and no explanation for the logical problem of first language Acquisition. Behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the cognitive revolution and Chomsky's claim of an innate faculty (LAD).1970sIn the 1970s the general trend in SLA was for research exploring the ideas of Corder and Selinker, particularly in their two publications which are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA : Pit Corder's 1967 essay The Significance of Learners' Errors, and Larry Selinker's 1972 article Interlanguage. Corder's essay rejected a behaviorist account of SLA and suggested that learners made use of intrinsic internal linguistic processes; Selinker's article argued that second-language learners possess their own individual linguistic systems that are independent from both the first and second languages.Corder and Selinker refuted behaviorist theories of language acquisition. Examples of research in this time include research into error analysis, in transitional stages of second-language ability, and the morpheme studies investigating the order in which learners acquired linguistic features. The 70s were dominated by naturalistic of people learning English as a second language.1980sBy the 1980s, the theories of Stephen Krashen had become the prominent paradigm in SLA. The input hypothesis, also known as the monitor model, is a group of five hypotheses of second-language acquisition developed by this linguist (Stephen Krashen) in the 1970s and 1980s. Krashen originally formulated the input hypothesis as just one of the five hypotheses, but over time the term has come to refer to the five hypotheses as a group. …",

Can trust between people be formed on the basis of Internet contact alone? Forming the required expectation in regard to another person, and so trusting them on some matter, may be due to believing that they are trustworthy; to believing that they seek es teem and will be rationally responsive to the good opinion communicated or promised by an act of trust; or to both factors at once. Neither mechanism can rationally command confidence, however, in the case where people are related only via the Internet.

Conceptions of intelligence have largely been appropriated by schools as tools by which to select and grade both pupils and materials. Intelligence, it has been argued, may be defined in terms of good performance in the official school curriculum or in terms of an ability to 'mess' or 'have a laugh'. Intelligence becomes defined in terms of 'knowing how to handle oneself under a variety of circumstances. One who knows how to 'handle' his or herself may be called 'smart' or 'street-wise' in one social set, 'brilliant' or 'sparkling' in another. The denial of opportunity through the unequal distribution of the fruits of social labour violates an individual's sense of moral order and also the individual's intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract I address the question of \"animal precursors to language\" by focusing on the symbolic or functional, that is, communicative, dimension. I look first at the communicative activities of our nearest primate relatives, the great apes, with a special focus on their communicative gestures, which are much more sophisticated from a functional point of view than are their vocalizations. I then compare great ape gestural comunication to the prelinguistic gestures of human infants (especially pointing) and the cognitive and social-cognitive skills underlying these: such things as joint attention, communicative intentions (intentions about intentional states), and the motivation to share experience with others. I end by arguing that the reason both the pointing gesture and linguistic conventions come naturally to humans, but not to other great apes, is because they both rely on a common social-cognitive, social-motivational infrastructure of shared intentionality.",

      "abstract": "Reports of not feeling understood are frequent in testimonies of psychological trauma. I argue that these feelings are not a matter of a cognitive failure but rather an expression of the absence of a more pervasive background feeling of belonging. Contemporary accounts of we-intentionality promise but ultimately fall short in explaining this sense of belonging. Gerda Walther offers an alternative account of communal experiences. Her notion of “habitual unification” can explain the background feelings of belonging that are woven through the individual’s everyday experience of being in a shared world. Having unified with another person, the world feels different. It is now experienced in light of a “we.” This is not only the case in actual, singular person-to-person encounters. Unification with others becomes habitual: it retreats into the background of the individual’s awareness, colouring their experience of the world. Thus sedimented, it forms a background sense of belonging to a shared world. Unification is enabled by experiencing others as being similar in a significant way, such as having the same experiences, values, or basic attitude: in Walther’s words, as being a “human, who also….” This, I shall argue, is impacted through traumatizing experiences. Trauma survivors struggle to experience others as “humans, who also…,” resulting in a failure of unification and thus impeding feelings of belonging.

      "title": "What If? The Evolutionary Basis for Different Pathways",
      "abstract": "All too often, we see our evolutionary past as some inevitable ladder of progression. In considering our emotional connections, it is easy to imagine that the increased external friendliness and sensitivity seen in ‘modern’ humans represents some progressive or superior development from a more aggressive past. However, a close consideration of how external friendliness changes in closely related species reveals a far more complex picture, with advantages and disadvantages to different evolutionary pathways, each displaying a different type of prosocial or collaborative behaviour. There are always many possible evolutionary pathways, affecting brains, bodies and behaviours. Here, however, we focus on simple contrasts in the adaptive routes followed within our nearest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, and those within our closest friends, wolves and dogs. This brings some insights into how an increased openness, and the capacities to develop new external bonds, may have evolved. We reveal that each evolutionary pathway brought both advantages and disadvantages, depending on context, rather than any specific pathway being a progression. Our similar physiological and behavioural adaptations under pressures to be more tolerant (discussed in Part 2) suggest that the same processes that occurred in these species also affected humans. An understanding of our evolutionary past as one of different alternative trajectories, and of possibilities and constraints along these, helps to frame our understanding of the process of human evolution, and the story of our origins.",

      "title": "Dominant Cultural Attitudes in Manu’a*",
      "abstract": "Chiefly concerned then with their social pattern, the Samoans have time for little else. Pondering upon the exigencies of ordered society, they take small interest in the world of the supernatural, nor are they puzzled and perplexed by the world of natural phenomena. The wavering line which divides the animate from the inanimate, the personal from the impersonal, borders their field of attention instead of threading its way among their preoccupations. For an interest in the intractability of material, the unaccountable tendency of wood to split or gardens to languish, they have substituted an interest in the personnel of carpentering or gardening parties. It is not that they have a clearer knowledge of the properties of material things than the Maori, who must perform long rituals to remove the sacredness from a tree which they wish to cut down. Occasional particular tapus, explicit beliefs in some animate phenomenon, attest to their typical untrained confusion. But their all inclusive social formula gives them no acceptable basis of interest in the mysterious properties of material things or natural phenomena. As the development of a human personality may be expressed in terms of choices made between many interests in an effort to bring all parts of one's character within one coherent picture, so a culture like Samoa may be envisaged also. A diffuse cultural equipment which drew from attitudes 247widely distributed in the Pacific has been reshaped to an individual people's emphasis. White civilization, on coming in contact with a primitive people, may teach them that material things must not be regarded animistically or that their gods are false. So the adult's world takes the varied conceptions of the child, pooh-poohs its rituals, ridicules its tapus and insists upon an acceptance of the findings of science. But without definite pedagogic discipline, many children will make some of these selections for themselves in terms of their own temperaments; one child will spend all his strength striving to control the world by means of formulas; another will devote himself to a careful investigation of the properties of material things or the principles of mechanics; a third will throw all his energies in establishing social rapport with his fellows. So human societies, left to themselves, will select parts of their heritage for elaboration, and the original choice will gain in impetus from generation to generation until a coherent individual culture has been developed. A strong religious interest, a premium upon aberrant individual gifts, a permission to love without social sanction and give without stint to that which is loved; all these would disturb the nice balance of Samoan society and so are outlawed. Samoa may be said to have a formal social personality, to be a devotee of a careful observance of all the decreed amenities.",

      "abstract": "As an operative force, the well-known mechanism of catharsis (cleansing, elimination, purification, purge, purgation of emotion, epuration...) can easily be used or misused, depending on the context of its appearance. A mediating question would be whether this mechanism is set in motion spontaneously, or if it must be seen as almost always assembled and constructed. What are the conditions in which it appears? Can it be elicited anywhere, at any moment? Can it be set in motion by anyone? In order to fulfill its purpose as an artistic practice, and thus to have a far-reaching impact, it needs to be conceptually unobtrusive and inconspicuous. Conversely, with its improper use, any content aiming to convince, to leave an impression or an imprint of authenticity, can be viciously exposed to ridicule or scorn. Worse, it can lose its credibility altogether. Briefly, my thesis is that the use or misuse of the mechanism of catharsis (I would dare to contend – even of affect itself as the power of performing) is directly tied to the functionality or disfunctionality of a community, which in our case means a community with democratic aspirations.",

Possibly this ability to shut out the everyday world with its reality-bound constrictions is a very useful adjunct to exploring and stretching the boundaries of thought in play. Watch the baby stare at her eyes, play with her fingers, become alert at her voice, finger her face, explore her mouth. Play comes first; toys merely follow. Children who are given a wide choice of toys will exploit the different qualities and properties of different kinds in a very eclectic and catholic manner.

They are, in fact, driven on by the requirements of their position to the elaboration of ideas, and in the end to some sort of social philosophy; and the philosophies that have driving force behind them are those which arise after this fashion out of the practical demands of human feeling.

      "title": "Sampling in Ethnographic Fieldwork",
      "abstract": "An ethnographer cannot avoid selecting some people, objects, or events for study, thereby renouncing, for a time at least, the possibility of studying others. From a vast range of possibilities, he takes up work in a particular tribe, village, or town; questions certain respondents; employs a few informants; observes some artefacts, situations, or behavioural events, and makes observations at restricted times. If the word 'sampling' is used so broadly, then fieldworkers are constantly sampling the universe of people, situations, objects and behavioural events with which they are occupied. Seldom, however, do they keep track of how they drew a sample or report its composition. Even statements as general as my pseudonymous list of principal Kaska Indian informants and subjects,1 and Margaret Mead's 'neighbourhood maps',2 identifying the adolescent and pre-adolescent girls she observed, are rare. An anthropologist characteristically extends his remarks beyond his sample and talks about 'the' Kaska Indians and Samoan girls or about child rearing, quarrels and pottery techniques in general-as though he had studied the community, category, or topic exhaustively. The usual spoken implication is that for his problem, the sample adequately represented a larger universe of actors, topics, culture patterns, techniques, or other units under study and, therefore, could provide reliable information about that universe as it existed at a particular time. A statistically conscious observer might object and point out that for a sample to be considered in a strict sense representative of the universe whence it came, it must have been selected in a suitable manner. Anthropologists are likely to respond by protesting that it is not they who decide what persons or events to use as sources of data; such decisions are practically made for them when certain individuals volunteer their help, some groups extend welcome, and some techniques happen to be accessible to observation.3 That units force themselves on a researcher's attention, is merely a figure of speech. It overlooks the fieldworker's readiness to respond positively or negatively to certain cues in the field situation and ignores his active involvement in deciding how to respond to environmental opportunities or when to surrender to unbreachable limitations.",

This doesn't mean that she cannot provide reasons for or a narrative about her actions. It is just that those reasons and that narrative are someone else's. People abnegate part of their agency regularly; for example, this is done within hierarchical institutions. In other times, the self-abnegation is all-encompassing; for example, this happens to victims of brainwashing. An agent in such a position can completely fail to understand herself or be understood as having a self. This can arise from internal and external forces. After describing the features of self-abnegation, Wieland concludes by considering whether the self-abnegated person is owed respect. Should a person be treated as if her reasons and narratives were her own even though they are derived from the will of another? Are we obligated to cultivate self-affirmation in the self-abnegating agent?",

      "abstract": "Silence is an universal language. If there is anything that crosses multiple cultures, in ways that seem so familiar to anyone, this can be achieved by silence. The concept of silence does not need grammatical forms, declinations or accents, although it includes them on a subtle level, silence does not need, most of the time, translation, it goes without saying, because its peculiarities are predominantly emotional, and emotions are universal. Of course, there can be cultures of noise, just as, for example, there are cultures of silence, inclined towards an expression that includes to a very large extent the need for silence. In theatrical art, we cannot get rid of the “other” or the “others” – stage partner, audience, director, etc. The profile of a so-called “other” is a hypostasis that seems to offer a more intimate setting, a direct connection, without witnesses, that moment of wholeness to which a man, from time to time, aspires. The silent being attracts the being in need of an answer. Is “the other” a foreign, separate, culturally or metaphorically distanced formula? This study aims to x-ray moments where the other (either a character, a state, a world, etc.) meets another and decides to “complete” him, to adhere to each other's world, or, on the contrary, to cause him to distance himself and close himself in his own world. The gaze cast at the “other” is a glance thrown beyond the boundaries of one's own person – the gaze of one is silently linked to the gaze of the other.",

This has the consequence that one cannot sincerely assent to a prescription without becoming disposed to comply with it or to wish others to comply with it. The most obvious members of this class are those typically expressed in the imperative mood. The fact that many languages devote a grammatical mood specifically to this kind of speech act shows that their speakers assign a particular role to them. We must not assume, however. either that imperatives are the only kind of prescriptions, or that all imperatives are similar to each other in all their features, The imperative mood can be used to express military commands, polite requests, instructions for using hair-driers or cooking omelets or finding a friend’s house, entreaties, prayers. and any number of other kinds of prescriptive speech act. The most general term for speech acts of this kind is telling someone to do something, in contrast to telling him (or her) that something is the case. This applies even to prayers, where the speaker has no authority or power of enforcement, but is in a completely subordinate relation.",

      "abstract": "Early cognitive development benefits from nonlinguistic representations of skeletal sets of domain-specific principles and complementary domain-relevant data abstraction processes. The principles outline the domain, identify relevant inputs, and structure coherently what is learned. Knowledge acquisition within the domain is a joint function of such domain-specific principles and domain-general learning mechanisms. Two examples of early learning illustrate this. Skeletal preverbal counting principles help children sort different linguistic strings into those that function as the conventional count-word as opposed to labels for objects in the child's linguistic community. Skeletal causal principles, working with complementary perceptual processes that abstract information about biological and nonbiological conditions and patterns of movement, lead to the rapid acquisition of knowledge about the animate-inanimate distinction. By 3 years of age children con soy whether photographs of unfamiliar nonmammalian animals, mammals, statues, and wheeled objects portray objects capable or incapable of self-generated motion. They also generate answers to questions about the insides of animate items more readily than ones about the insides of inanimate items. Although these children already ore articulate about matters relevant to a theory of action, their limited knowledge of growth illustrates that early skeletal principles do not rule out the need to acquire new principles, in this case ones that underlie a biological account of animacy (Carey, 1985).",

They seem a necessary ingredient of our attempts to sustain a basic sense of identity, or as Erikson (1950) described it, to protect a sense of personal continuity, unity, and social recognition. As such, they make us an individual in the eyes of others as well as ourselves. But they are also the orientating instruments by which we try to bring some coherence to our own life or to set out new directions. For psychologists, self-referential processes retain an intriguing, though somewhat elusive character, which makes it difficult to capture them in a single, neat conceptual and empirical framework. In a sense, the content of such processes seems to typify the person one has grown to be. Yet, in another sense, they constitute the foreshadowing of the person one could become. Moreover, in both cases, as James explained, these processes introduce an element of recursivity in the way we experience ourselves, without totally merging with ongoing mental, behavioral, and social processes.",

However, a perceptual object is usually defined by many perceptual dimensions and related to many physical dimensions. Accordingly a multidimensional state-space model of perception is proposed. The state space of visual perception consists of several dimensions including perceptual dimensions of color, shape, size, as well as spatial dimensions. A point in the state space represents a perceptual object which has some color, size, shape, and is located at a certain point in the visual space of an observer. Different points in the state space correspond to different perceptual objects in some perceptual characteristics and/or in location. Distances between these points correspond to differences in perceptual characteristics and/or perceived spatial separation. Interactions between different points indicate some perceptual phenomena related to these objects, e.g. perceptual grouping, apparent motion, etc.",

      "abstract": "Narratological studies have quite frequently focused upon linguistic structures, considered to be paradigmatic cases of narrativity, whereas pictorial signs (such as icons and symbols) or indices have received comparably much less attention. In this paper, however, I intend to outline some basic and regularly occurring narrative aspects of pictures and non-pictorial objects. As a point of departure, I shall suggest (influenced by approaches from cognitive psychology, e.g. the work of Roger Schank) that cognition basically consists of the storage and retrieval of action scripts or schemata (i.e. narrative structures) which may occur on various levels of abstraction. These schemas incorporate generalized knowledge about event sequences (e.g. the order in which specific events will take place; causal, enabling, or conventionalized relations between these events, and what kind of events occur at all in certain action sequences). Moreover, there are also scene schemas which are rather characterized by spatial than temporal relations. This means that we have mentally stored inventory information, i.e. what kinds of objects normally appear in such situations, as well as spatial-relation information, i.e. concerning the usual spatial layout of a scene. Through previous experiences we acquire a large amount of such culturally based event and scene stereotypes (along with idiosyncratic variations), either due to our previously acquired, direct familiarity with instances of events, or due to our acquaintance with written, oral, and of course pictorial descriptions of them (e.g. religious or mythological tales). They include settings, sub-goals, and actions in attempting to reach specific goals. The production and comprehension of pictorial signs, as I will claim, is frequently based upon the existence and activation of such mentally stored action and scene schemas on part of the beholders. Actually, even things in general, whether artificial or natural objects, are capable of expressing or triggering such narrative structures, thus “telling us stories”. In this paper, I shall present some examples of pictures and non-pictorial objects where narrative structures become activated and, indeed, their recognisability and comprehensibility as such presupposes these structures.

To give rise to the manifestations of energy, these substances must have a certain degree of instability or lability; that is, must be capable under definite conditions of undergoing changes in structure, disruptions, etc., all of which give rise to motion.

      "title": "Pride and Identity",
      "abstract": "Abstract How is it that pride has gone from being one of the traditional seven deadly sins to becoming, in recent decades, the banner under which social movements have declared their objectives (Black Pride, Gay Pride, and so on)? How are we to understand the shift from a theology of sin to a politics of self-assertion (and an accompanying psychology of self-esteem)? Is it simply that times have changed? That, God having died, attitudes have changed—so that what once was thought to precede a fall now seems a condition of rising? Or is it perhaps that the nature of pride is to be understood differently in the two contexts? There may be an inherent ambiguity in pride: associating it on the one hand with arrogance, conceit, egotism, and vanity, and on the other hand with self-respect, self-esteem, self-confidence, dignity. (On certain readings, these may all be seen as different kinds or degrees of self-love.) Thus at different times, different aspects of the nature of the emotion come to be given prominence. Or is the difference in the objects? One place to start is with the recognition that the object, and the subject, of the traditional sin was the individual. The social movements that argue for pride are concerned with groups. How do individual and group identity come together in pride?",

      "title": "Love Without the Obligation to Love",
      "abstract": "Love Without the Obligation to Love1 Cindy Patton (bio) It’s frightening to feel so little attachment to a life that’s so full of the things other people long for—rightly long for, I think: a lot of intimacy, enough money, peace and privacy, intellectual stimulation, plenty of recognition, time for my own work, no violence, both parents living, mostly good health, a long, tender relationship with my fella, oodles of terrific friends. . . . It’s not that these things don’t seem miraculous. . . . I’ve the most acute sense that things not only could be infinitely worse, but actually are for most people. Though I can’t imagine why that’s supposed to be a cheering realization!2 [T]he naturalization of social arbitrariness causes it to be forgotten that, in order for this reality called “family” to be possible, certain social conditions that are in no way universal have to be fulfilled. . . . [T]he family in its legitimate definition is a privilege instituted into a universal norm: a de facto privilege that implies a symbolic privilege—the privilege of being comme il faut, conforming to the norm, and therefore enjoying a symbolic profit of normality. Those who have the privilege of having a “normal” family are able to demand the same of everyone without having to raise the question of the conditions (a certain income, living space, etc.) of universal access to what they demand universally.3 No reader—therapy fellow traveler, critic, homologously positioned academic or artist—can help but be moved by the eloquence with which Eve Sedgwick’s A Dialogue on Love conveys the gripping struggle with mortality, [End Page 215] not first in the face of her own cancer or others’ AIDS, but rather in the context of feeling out of place in the world. There is so much in the text and, yet, so few hints about how to be a worthy reader. In a classroom, one might be tempted to say, “What is Sedgwick saying?” But I remember a conversation with Eve in the late 1980s.4 I was grappling with how to write elegantly, recursively, but clearly in the then-popular deconstructionist High Style. I think I said, “I’m trying to communicate . . .” and she laughed in that high-pitched voice of hers, as delicate and tentative and unpredictable as a flat pebble skipping across the surface of a faintly rippled pond: “That’s the difference!” She described her writing process and explained that however much she shaped her prose through meticulous editing, it was the reader who would bend her works to their place and their meanings. Writing is poesis, not communication. From its title to its ending, through graphic design and shifts in voice and address, A Dialogue on Love is Sedgwick’s own high-water mark in this understanding of writing, blurring the line between forms of self-assertion and forms of listening, forms of intending meaning, and forms of not being heard. “Eve” plays hide and seek with the reader, offering various angles on her body and feelings, and then veiling these with (her therapist) Shannon’s words, perpetually grafting fragments of her poems onto fragments of therapy notes, sometimes Shannon’s official record, sometimes her therapy journals, in one moment her once estranged sister’s childhood diary accounts of Eve, in other places e-mail exchanges with friend Tim—any of which might be Kathy Acker–like plagiarism or faked autobiography.5 Although Eve did a great deal to make me smarter, I turned out to think like a busted-up social scientist, the bastard issue of qualitative empiricism and rhetorical deconstruction, a lost wild child from the literary turn in the social sciences (now passed, I note with regret). I therefore leave it to the literary critics to say how A Dialogue on Love works as a text and instead I open this particular iteration of Sedgwick’s corpus to a sociohistorical, or historicosocial, reading. I do not ignore her aesthetic devices, but recognize them as necessities for marking a place so personal and specific as sometimes not to communicate, as the techniques of a gifted mind that sprung from a quirky but quite...",

      "abstract": "Once the chimpanzee has been exposed to language training, it solves certain kinds of problems that it does not solve otherwise. Specifically, it can solve problems on a conceptual rather than a sensory basis. For example, it is only after it has been language trained that the normal chimpanzee can match, say, ¾ apple with ¾ cylinder of water, i.e., match equivalent proportions of objects that do not look alike. Similarly, it can match not only relations of sameness to sameness, but also difference to difference. The change from sensory to conceptual responding that language training appears to induce in the chimpanzee thus resembles a developmental transition that normal children undergo in the 'natural' course of things – though whether the two changes are genuinely comparable is one of several ontogenetic questions that remain to be answered.",

La naturaleza de los estímulos sensoriales es variable en función de las características de cada órgano sensorial. Algunos de ellos detectan ondas electromagnéticas o sonoras; otros moléculas odorantes o gustativas; otros más la presión ejercida en ellos o la temperatura, e incluso el equilibrio y la aceleración del cuerpo. La entera gama de los sentidos humanos provee de información al cerebro para poder organizar e interpretar la plétora de sensaciones aprehendidas, a través del proceso de percepción. Al ligar los estímulos recién percibidos con las emociones, la experiencia previa, y demás contenidos mentales (conscientes o inconscientes), la percepción es una suerte de artista que ofrece una imagen significativa y coherente; una pintura de la realidad. Tal imagen puede resultar muy distinta para otros animales que cuentan con menos sentidos o alternativas, percibiendo menos aspectos de la realidad que nosotros; tal como ocurre con los perros, quienes cuentan con una visión dicromática del color (Neitz et al., 1989). O, al contrario, al estar dotados con sentidos que nosotros apenas podemos imaginar, como la detección de campos eléctricos o magnéticos, o la icónica ecolocalización (de la cual los murciélagos y los delfines son los representantes por antonomasia), el retrato de la realidad con el que cuentan otros animales se ve enriquecido con estos matices que no aparecen en nuestra pintura.",

To the extent that the symbol poses a moral question it should be spiritual, emotive, and applicable to instances of overexploitation and excessive waste. Technology should not be automatically excluded, nor should the focus be restricted to organizations ( versus people) or specific age-groups. The essential message to be communicated is wholeness through feedback. Suitable geometric forms include irregular lines ending where they begin, circles, spheres, and (in terms of computer imagery) pulsating objects.

      "title": "Discrimination Forms in the Professional Area 1",
      "abstract": "Relevant theoretical background for approaching the discrimination phenomenonDiscrimination (Latin discriminatio - separation) a concept closely related to the one of difference. The original meaning of separation has the significance of a neutral act, even a passive one of establishing a difference - which closely linked to the identification process. Territoriality the one determining individuals to notice the presence of a different being in their proximity and, in the identification process, to adopt an attitude against this being, either aggressive or non-aggressive. Hence, when a group, irrespective of the species, uses elements/signals of identification between its members and ones of differentiation against one or more individuals for adopting a certain delimitation attitude, we deal with discriminatory behaviour, which does not presuppose moral connotation. Thus, identity represents a posture adopted for the duration of an interaction, a possibility of an individual, (or of a group of individuals) to organise relationships against one another (...) From this perspective, the individual not perceived as determined by his belonging because he the one which gives a significance to the latter! (Ogien, 1987, p. 135)In the fifties, under the influence of social movements, the negative connotation developed with respect to the term of discrimination. The initial, neutral meaning, synonymous with the distinction, took over a pejorative connotation. Now, it about differentiation actions either abusively or illegally, by separating a social group and treating another in a disfavouring manner, one way or the other. At the same time, the term of non-discrimination emerges, with the entire associated conceptualisation.There are differences in the social contexts in which individuals practicing discrimination function. In the case of Europe, we might talk about a shared common definition of discrimination, and of its institutionalisation/regulation by laws, actions of repression taken by authorities against discriminatory acts. However, there are outside the democratic states, governments openly legitimising, in the name of morality, religion, or ideology, forms that we call discrimination. Examples therefore are the laws limiting fundamental liberties of women, or that deny the rights of indigenous people; it a type of discrimination depriving de facto individuals from the viewpoint of human rights. As result, defining discrimination related closely to the values of the societies. Some individuals may be discriminated based on the complex of elements constituting their identity, such as the case of an indigenous woman - she can be discriminated as woman, but also as person belonging to the indigenous populations.According to the sociologist Mihailescu loan (1993), discrimination represents difference, restriction, exclusion, preference or differing treatment which disadvantages an individual/group, as compared to others in the same situations, or the use of unequal treatment against a person or against a group of persons in relationship with other categorical features: racial, ethnic or religious belonging, or class attachment. The term is used for describing the action of a dominant majority in relationship with a minority and involves a prejudice caused to an individual or to a (Mihailescu I., in Zamfir and Vlasceanu, 1993, p. 177).The discrimination represents, consequently, the differentiated treatment applied to an individual by its inclusion into a certain social group. Discrimination an individual action, but if the members of the same group are treated similarly, then it represents a social model of collective behaviour (Banton, 1998). In social sciences, the term refers to the differentiated treatment against the large majority, with negative effects on the individual exposed to it.The United Nations Organisation includes in discrimination any conduct based on the distinction operated in relationship with certain natural and social categories and which not related to the individual capacities and merits, or to the actual behaviour of an individual. …",

      "title": "AN ANALYSIS OF LINGUISTIC NORMATIVITY AND COMMUNICATION AS A RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS TO A BIOPSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATION FOR LINGUISTICS",
      "abstract": "1.The Objection from Linguistic NormsThe Scientific and Manifest Images of LanguageThis paper considers how scientific understanding of language fits together with our everyday, commonsense understanding of language, according to which language is used for communication between persons, and follows or fails to follow certain essentially normative constraints.The scientific view of world poses theoretical threat to our commonsense understanding of our place in it as persons. As Sellars writes in Philosophy and Scientific Image of Man:Does manifest of man-in-the-world survive attempt to unite this in one field of intellectual vision with man as conceived in terms of postulated objects of scientific theory? bite to this question lies, we have seen, in fact that man is that being which conceives of itself in terms of manifest image. To extent that manifest does not survive in synoptic view, to that extent man himself would not survive (18).Something similar could be said regarding manifest of human language. of language as normative (as opposed to merely descriptive), personal (as opposed to merely sub-personal), social (as opposed to merely individual), and serving communication (as opposed to merely serving thought) would be lost if not shown consistent, somehow, with its scientific counterpart.Because use of language is important to commonsense understanding of human beings as persons, consideration of Sellars' analysis of scientific and manifest images of human beings is relevant to apparent conflicts between scientific and manifest images of language.Humans appear in different ways to different sciences. We have images in social science, psychology, physiology, biochemistry, and all way down to physics, in which we appear as a swirl of physical particles, forces, and fields (Sellars, Philosophy and Scientific Image of Man, 20). The scientific of humans is an idealization of bringing together of these various special images. All of them, and thus the scientific itself, Sellars writes to be contrasted with man as he appears to himself in sophisticated common sense, manifest which even today contains most of what he knows about himself at properly human level (20).Though, historically, scientific of human beings and of world in general grows out of basis in their manifest image, once generated and developed, scientific presents itself as rival, conflicting with theory and ontology of manifest image. Though scientific of world stems from manifest as an historical basis, it also views manifest itself as an object in world and, from lens of scientific image, this manifest is at best pragmatically useful approximation of ultimate scientific reality (Sellars, 20).The conflict of scientific and manifest images of human beings, Sellars notes, leave us with seemingly inescapable trilemma. We are apparently forced to choose between: dualism in which men as scientific objects are contrasted with 'minds' which are source and principle of their existence as persons; (b) abandoning reality of persons as well as manifest physical objects in favor of exclusive reality of scientific objects; (c) returning once and for all to thesis of merely 'calculational' or 'auxiliary' status of theoretical frameworks and to affirmation of primacy of manifest image (38-9).To accept (a) means resorting to an outdated, Cartesian conception of human mind, at best rendering scientific incomplete, and at worst leaving our fundamental conception of personhood mere epiphenomenon. To accept (b) is simply to eliminate our fundamental conception of personhood altogether. And to accept (c) is to rob scientific enterprise of its claim to legitimately pursuing truth. …",

      "title": "How to Walk Your Talk: Effective Use of Body Language for Business Professionals",
      "abstract": "Introduction1Human beings cannot survive without each other; in other words, we are all dependent on each other for our survival. And, we need to communicate with each other for the same. Thus, communication has become the lifeblood without which we cannot progress in personal or professional life. The growing importance of communication in each and every field has created an awareness about using body language effectively. It is our body language which makes our communication complete. When thinking about body language, one needs to remember that our overriding objective is to ensure that the audience listens to what we have to say, and is not distracted by the way we are saying it, consciously or subconsciously. Body movements and gestures are unconscious forms of expressions and therefore they have a language of their own. When we communicate, 99% of our concentration remains on the subject matter and we remain unaware of our gestures and body movements. But one can easily understand our mood, intention and thoughts if one notices our gestures and movements.The very moment we interact with others, people perceive and judge us by what they see and feel. This process of having a first impression just takes less than 10 seconds but the impression becomes permanent. Hence, the paper aims at understanding the effective use of body language for business excellence and success.Significance of Body LanguageIt is really difficult to decode body language; however, once we understand our client's gestures and body language, we can read our client like a book. Here, we can take the example of oriental business people who are experts in this regard. They are usually good at making out and using nonverbal signals. The study of body language has become so vital that behavioral tests are introduced in order to map a candidate during an interview.Research reveals that the human body can produce over 700,000 unique movements. These movements have been categorized into about 60 discrete and symbolic signals and around 60 gestures (Brenner, 2004).So, if we just know some of these, it can help us communicate better in our personal and professional life. For example, open hands while communicating signifies open to ideas and suggestions and go ahead attitude; rubbing the nose with fingers while someone is speaking shows disagreement; sitting cross-legged means alertness; a smile that suddenly turns into laughter shows true happiness.However, some nonverbal signals may have several meanings such as crossed arms can signify simply a comfortable position or defensiveness; or touching the nose can imply doubt in what the person is hearing or it could be a response to soreness or itch from a recent cold. Similarly, an unbuttoned jacket can signify cooperation and openness. The arm extended with thumb pointed up and hitchhiking pose can give a negative meaning in some cultures.We need to understand that nonverbal signal is not a complete message. We can watch for a pattern of signals that have the same meaning and endeavor to recognize them separately. The body language should match the verbal expressions. It should also match the context of the situation. So we can look for body language in clusters of signals with common meanings. Once we comprehend body language, we can use our own voice and body to sync and give an apt presentation.Reasons to Improve the Body LanguageThe growing awareness about body language indicates just how important a factor this has become in business. As mentioned earlier, when thinking about body language, one needs to remember that the overriding objective is to ensure that the audience listens to what we have to say, and is not distracted by the way we are saying it, consciously or subconsciously.* Words are only 7% of your communication: The rest is our voice tonality (38%) and our body language is 55%, according to research done by Albert Mehrabian. …",

      "title": "Morphogenesis versus structuration: on combining structure and action<sup>1</sup>",
      "abstract": "The fundamental problem of linking human agency and social structure stalks through the history of sociological theory. Basically it concerns how to develop an adequate theoretical account which deals simultaneously with men constituting society and the social formation of human agents. For any theorist, except the holist, social structure is ultimately a human product, but for any theorist, except advocates of psychologism, this product in turn shapes individuals and influences their interaction. However successive theoretical developments have tilted either towards structure or towards action, a slippage which has gathered in momentum over time. Initially this meant that one element became dominant and the other subordinate: human agency had become pale and ghostly in mid-century functionalism, whilst structure betook an evanescent fragility in the re-flowering of phenomenology. Eventually certain schools of thought repressed the second element almost completely. On the one hand structuralist Marxism and normative functionalism virtually snuffed-out agency – the acting subject became increasingly lifeless whilst the structural or cultural components enjoyed a life of their own, self-propelling or self-maintaining. On the other hand interpretative sociology busily banished the structural to the realm of objectification and facticity – human agency became sovereign whilst social structure was reduced to supine plasticity because of its constructed nature. Although proponents of these divergent views were extremely vociferous, they were also extensively criticized and precisely on the grounds that both structure and action were indispensable in sociological explanation.2 Moreover serious efforts to re-address the problem and to re-unite structure and action had already begun from inside ‘the two Sociologies’ (Dawe 1970), when they were characterized in this manichean way. These attempts emerged after the early sixties from ‘general’ functionalists (e.g. Blau 1964; Gouldner 1976; Buckley 1967; Etzioni 1968; Eisenstadt and Curelaru 1977), ‘humanistic’ marxists (e.g. Lockwood 1964; Pizzorno 1968; Touraine 1968; Wellmer 1971; Habermas 1971 and 1972; Anderson 1976) and from interactionists confronting the existence of strongly patterned conduct (e.g. Goffman 1964; Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson 1974). Furthermore they were joined in the same decade by a bold attempt to undercut the problem by disclosing ‘hidden structures’ which simultaneously governed overt structural organization and observable action patterns (Lévi-Strauss 1963; Sebag 1964; Piaget 1968. See also Boudon 1968; Glucksman 1974; Bottomore and Nisbet 1979). Building on these bases in a very eclectic manner, two new perspectives have since begun to mature which directly tackle the relationship between structure and action and seek to unite them. One is the ‘morphogenetic approach’,3 advanced within general systems theory, whose best known exponent is Walter Buckley (Buckley 1967, 1968. See also Maruyama 1963). Its sociological roots go back to the three kinds of theoretical revisionism mentioned in the last paragraph, but the other part of its pedigree is cybernetics. The second perspective is ‘structuration’, recently spelt-out by Anthony Giddens. Whilst integrating some of the same revisionist material, this approach leans much more heavily on the newer linguistic structuralism, semiotic studies and hermeneutics. Both the ‘morphogenetic’ and ‘structuration’ approaches concur that ‘action’ and ‘structure’ presuppose one another: structural patterning is inextricably grounded in practical interaction. Simultaneously both acknowledge that social practice is ineluctably shaped by the unacknowledged conditions of action and generates unintended consequences which form the context of subsequent interaction. The two perspectives thus endorse the credo that the ‘escape of human history from human intentions, and the return of the consequences of that escape as causal influences upon human action, is a chronic feature of social life’ (Giddens 1979: 7). Where they differ profoundly is in how they conceptualize it, and how, on that basis, they theorize about the structuring (and re-structuring) of social systems. In dealing with ‘structuration’ this paper concentrates exclusively upon Anthony Giddens's book Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure and Contradiction in Social Analysis (1979), since its density and range require close textual attention. Giddens's whole approach hinges on overcoming three dichotomies and it is these dualisms which he strips away from a variety of sources, then recombining their residues: First he insists on an account of human agency which is intrinsically related to the subject acting in society, thus seeking to transcend the dualism between voluntarism and determinism. Hence both deterministic attempts to get behind the ‘backs of actors’ (as in organic functionalism and orthodox Marxism) and the excessive voluntarism which neglects the structural context (as in contemporary action theories) are equally condemned. Second he seeks to mediate the dichotomy between subject and object by assigning a prime role to the knowledgeability of actors in producing and reproducing their society, whilst acknowledging that they necessarily employ societal properties in the process. Thus structuralism and functionalism are criticized for subordinating the individual to society and Giddens aims to transcend the subject/object dualism by elaborating on common elements in the work of Marx and the later Wittgenstein which construe the generation of society as the outcome of praxis. Finally he rejects any theory which represses time by separating statics from dynamics and analysing the two separately. For to Giddens, any theory embodying the interdependence of structure and action is predicated upon grasping the temporal and spatial locations which are inherent in the constitution of all social interaction. Thus the division between synchrony and diachrony must also be transcended in order to capture the temporal release of unintended consequences and their subsequent influence on later action. Because of this rejection of the three dichotomies, ‘structuration’ is quintessentially concerned with duality not dualism, with amalgamating the two sides of each divide. This is to be achieved through the central notion of the ‘duality of structure’ which refers to ‘the essential recursiveness of social life, as constituted in social practices: structure is both medium and outcome of the reproduction of practices. Structure enters simultaneously into the constitution of the agent and social practices, and “exists” in the generating moments of this constitution’ (Giddens 1979: 5). This involves an image of society as a continuous flow of conduct (not a series of acts) which changes or maintains a potentially malleable social world. In turn it obviously proscribes any discontinuous conceptualization of structure and action – the intimacy of their mutual constitution defies it. ‘Structuration’ is predicated upon the ‘duality of structure’: analytically it disengages continuities or transformations in the reproduction of social systems. Because of the dynamic interplay of the two constituent elements, ‘structuration’ does not denote fixity, durability, or even a point reached in development. ‘Structuration’ itself is ever a process and never a product. In elaborating his theory of ‘structuration’, however, Giddens completely ignores existing efforts to perform the same task of re-uniting structure and action from within general systems theory. This perspective has an even better claim than the former to call itself a ‘non-functionalist manifesto’;4 since a major part of its background was the growing disenchantment on the part of neo-functionalists with every remnant of the Organic Analogy – with the over-integrated view of social structure and the over-socialized view of man; with the assumption of immanent equilibration unrelated to human decision-making; with its failure to incorporate time – a double failure involving the absence of an analytical history of systemic emergence (grounded in human interaction, taking place in prior social contexts) and a failure to appreciate that the structural elaboration thus produced carries over to future time, providing new contexts for subsequent interaction. ‘Morphogenesis’ is also a process, referring to the complex interchanges that produce change in a system's given form, structure or state (morphostasis being the reverse), but it has an end-product, structural elaboration, which is quite different from Giddens's social system as merely a ‘visible pattern’. This to him can best be analysed as recurrent social practices, whereas to general systems theorists, the elaborated structure has properties which cannot be reduced to practices alone, although these are what generated both it and them. The emergent properties5 which characterize socio-cultural systems imply discontinuity between initial interactions and their product, the complex system. In turn this invites analytical dualism when dealing with structure and action. Action of course is ceaseless and essential both to the continuation and further elaboration of the system, but subsequent interaction will be different from earlier action because conditioned by the structural consequences of that prior action. Hence the morphogenetic perspective is not only dualistic but sequential, dealing in endless cycles of – structural conditioning/social interaction/structural elaboration – thus unravelling the dialectical interplay between structure and action. ‘Structuration’, by contrast, treats the ligatures binding structure, practice and system as indissoluble, hence the necessity of duality and the need to gain a more indirect analytical purchase on the elements involved. Hence Giddens's whole approach turns on overcoming the dichotomies which the morphogenetic perspective retains and utilizes – between voluntarism and determinism, between synchrony and diachrony, and between individual and society. In ‘place of each of these dualisms, as a single conceptual move, the theory of structuration substitutes the central notion of the duality of structure’ (Giddens 1979: 5). The body of this paper will: question the capacity of this concept to transcend such dichotomies in a way which is sociologically useful; defend the greater theoretical utility of analytical dualism, which underpins general systems theory; and, seek to establish the greater theoretical utility of the morphogenetic perspective over the structuration approach. Basically what Giddens is seeking to enfold here are two views of social institutions – institutions as causes of action (which has certain deterministic overtones) and institutions as embodiments of action (which has more voluntaristic connotations). Condensed in the brief statement that ‘structure is both medium and outcome of the reproduction of practices’ (1979: 69) is his method of bridging this dichotomy. The central notion of the ‘duality of structure’ makes up the bridge by dropping two planks from opposite banks so that they lie juxtaposed. First he advances the essential contribution made by knowledgeable actors in generating/transforming recurrent social practices – which in turn creates the ‘visible pattern’ that constitutes the social system for Giddens. Simultaneously, he lays down the fundamental proposition that when actors produce social practices they necessarily draw upon basic ‘structural properties’– these essential factors being viewed as a matrix of rules and resources. Ideally what he wants to integrate is the way in which the active creation of social conditions is itself unavoidably conditioned by needing to draw upon structural factors in the process. Perhaps this is clarified by consulting the kind of practical images Giddens has in mind. The references to agents producing recurrent social practices summon-up a picture of the ‘ruttedness’ of routine action – in bureaucracy, for instance, where life is constantly breathed into inert rules which then deaden their animators through routinization.6 But this is not the only picture he invokes. There is also metamorphosis, the generation of radically new practices when agency rides on the coat-tails of structural facilitation to produce social change of real magnitude. Although the ‘duality of structure’ spans both images, it provides no analytical grip on which is likely to prevail under what conditions or circumstances. The theory of ‘structuration’ remains fundamentally non-propositional. In other words the ‘central notion’ of the ‘structuration’ approach fails to specify when there will be ‘more voluntarism’ or ‘more determinism’. In fact, on the contrary, the ‘duality of structure’itself oscillates between the two divergent images it bestrides – between (a) the hyperactivity of agency, whose corollary is the innate volatility of society, and (b) the rigid coherence of structural properties associated, on the contrary, with the essential recursiveness of social life. Hyperactivity is an ineluctable consequence of all rules and resources being defined as transformative, in contradistinction to the rigid transformational grammar of linguistics. Resources are readily convertible, rules endlessly interpretable; the former providing material levers for transforming the empirical domain, the latter transfiguring codes and norms. Consequently the spatio-temporal constitution of society is ordered in terms of the mediations and transformations made possible by these two structural properties, as manipulated by agents. However it follows that if structural properties are inherently transformative then actors generically enjoy very high degrees of freedom – at any time they could have acted otherwise, intervening for change or for maintenance. Hence the counterfactual image of hyperactivity in which actors explore and exploit these generous degrees of freedom. Hence too the outcomes must be correspondingly variegated; society is not just ‘potentially malleable’ (Giddens 1979: 56), it becomes highly volatile if ‘the possibility of change is recognized as inherent in every circumstance of social reproduction’ (Giddens 1979: 210). The other side of the ‘duality of structure’ is intended to rectify the image and introduce a more recognizable picture of social life. Instead I believe over-correction takes place, generating a counter-image of ‘chronic recursiveness’ in society. Basically this arises because actors have to draw upon rules and resources in social interchange and these structural properties are thus reconstituted through such interaction. However Giddens goes further than this, now endorsing the kind of linguistic analogy disavowed in (a). Thus when actors do draw upon rules and resources they necessarily invoke the whole matrix of differences which constitute structures, ‘in the sense in which the utterance of a grammatical sentence presupposes the absent corpus of syntactical rules that constitute the language as a totality’. (1979: 71) In this way Giddens commits himself to an enormous coherence of the structural properties, such that actors' inescapable use of them embroils everyone in the stable reproduction of social systems. The pendulum swings so far the other way that we are now presented with another over-integrated view of man, for the ‘duality of structure’ relates the smallest item of day-to-day behaviour to attributes of far more inclusive social systems: ‘when I utter a grammatical English sentence in a casual conversation, I contribute to the reproduction of the English language as a whole. This is an unintended consequence of my speaking the sentence, but one that is bound in directly to the recursiveness of the duality of structure’ (Giddens 1979: 77–8). This rigidity of the recursive image is open to criticism on two counts. On the one hand, rules and resources are not so coherently organized as grammar, often lacking the mutually invocating character of syntax (to have a council house does not necessarily mean no telephone, low income, job insecurity etc.). On the other hand, action is not really so tightly integrated by these structural properties: not only may some of the smallest items of behaviour be irrelevant to the social system, certain larger ones may also be trivial, mutually cancelling or self-contained in their effects, whilst still other actions can produce far reaching aggregate and emergent consequences – yet these different possibilities remain undifferentiated by Giddens. What is wrong with this image, as with the previous one, is that it does not allow for some behaviour engendering replication whilst other action initiates transformation. Rather than transcending the voluntarism/determinism dichotomy, the two sides of the ‘duality of structure’ embody them respectively: they are simply clamped together in a conceptual vice. This oscillation between contradictory images derives from Giddens not answering ‘when’ questions– when can actors be transformative (which involves specification of degrees of freedom) and when are they trapped into replication (which involves specification of the stringency of constraints)? These answers in turn require analysis of the potential for change, which is rooted in systemic stability/instability, and the conditions under which actors do/do not capitalize on it. Although Giddens admits that structures are both facilitating and constraining, indeed it is one of the major theoretical tasks to discover what aspects of social organization govern the interconnection between the two (1979: 69–70), this is precisely, with one exception, what he does not do. His theory consistently avoids concrete propositions of this type. The reason for this omission is his principled but misguided distaste for the constraint concept (contaminated by functionism) (1979: 50–2): the exception, his analysis of contradiction, is of course on the contrary an example of systemic facilitation. Specification of the stringency of constraints is sedulously avoided at all three levels of analysis – structural properties, social institutions and social systems. Structural Properties are integral to social constitution and reconstitution, but when do they throw their weight behind the one or the other? Generally in sociology this has been tackled through an appreciation that some properties are more resilient or engender more resistance to change than others, at any given time. This specification of the strength of constraints is both impossible in Giddens's conceptualization and unacceptable to him. First his properties (defined reductively as rules and resources) are outside time and space, having a ‘virtual existence’ only when instantiated by actors. Second, since what is instantiated depends on the power of agency and not the nature of the property, then properties themselves are not differentially mutable. Excessive voluntarism enters through these two doors which are conceptually propped open. However, why should one accept this peculiar ontological status for structural properties in the first place? Where resources are concerned he argues that what exists in a spatio-temporal sense is only a ‘material existent’ which, to become operative as a resource has to be instantiated through power relations in conjunction with codes and norms (1979: 104). This is an argument of necessary accompaniment and it is not a very convincing one, for the so-called ‘material existents’ often constrain in their own right. Examples include various kinds of scarcity which can arise without power or normative regulation and involve nothing other than physiological signification, like famine, over-population, shortage of skills or land. In what possible sense do these require instantiation? They are there and the problem is how to get rid of them or deal with them. Less obviously, why should World Three knowledge, even if it lives on only in libraries, be regarded as outside time and space; it is there continuously and thus awaits not instantiation but activation.7 Yet when it is activated it contains its own potentials and limitations independent of the constructions and regulations imposed upon it. The fact that resources and their uses are usually entangled with rules of signification and legitimation and that these do make a difference should not be confounded with them making all the difference. Indeed the rules themselves are usually contested and are so precisely because the distribution or use of real resources is at stake. The latter in turn can also affect signification and regulation, instead of the relationship being exclusively the other way round. Furthermore the quality of the structural properties makes its own contribution to differential malleability, independent of the amount of power actors bring to bear. Some properties can be changed relatively quickly (tax rules), some take longer to change (demographic or knowledge distributions), some prove highly resistant to change (bureaucracy, gender distinctions, ethnicity), and some are unchangeable (exhausted natural resources or environmental ruin). Even more importantly, central configurations of rules and resources (the Law, the Constitution, or capitalism) display this differential mutability among their internal components. The key point here is that during the time it takes to change something, then that thing continues to exert a constraint which cannot be assumed to be insignificant in its social consequences, whilst it lasts. Nations can fall, polities be deposed and economies bankrupted, while efforts are being made to change the factors responsible. As a general theoretical proposition this holds good however short the time interval involved. Yet this is what Giddens spirits away by making structural properties atemporal and according them only a pale ‘virtual existence’. Social Institutions are conceptualized as standardized practices, enduring and widespread in society (Giddens 1979: 80). In dealing with social practices rather than with institutional operations, the earlier conceptual exercise (in which structural properties were transmuted into agents' power) is directly paralleled. It has identical effects; it amplifies voluntarism and minimizes constraint. The combined accentuation of actors' institutional knowledgeability and underemphasis of how institutions work ‘behind our backs’ (or before our faces for that matter) produces a complementary neglect of institutional characteristics in their own right. What this omits are characteristics of which people may well be aware (such as centralization, electoral systems or inflation), but which constrain them none the less (as well as others which constrain without much ‘discursive penetration’ of them, like international monetary policy or high science). Here explanatory reductionism attends treating the effects of, say, centralization as reducible to the exercise of power by determinate actors.8 The voluntaristic bias means that institutions are what people produce, not what they confront – and have to grapple with in ways which are themselves conditioned by the structural features involved.9 For Giddens institutional recursiveness never reflects the durability of constraint: it always represents the continuity of reproduction. Only at this level does Giddens concede that ‘unintended consequences of action stretch beyond the recursive effects of the duality of structure’ (1979: 78), producing what others would term ‘emergent properties’, but which he calls ‘self-regulating properties’. Immediately and categorically he asserts that it is their facilitating effects upon which theory should centre –‘the self-regulating properties of social systems must be grasped via a theory of system contradiction’ (1979: 76). The reason for this one-sidedness is that to Giddens contradictions represent cracks through which radical change can be forced by social conflict –‘ceteris paribus, conflict and contradiction have a tendency to coincide’ (1979: 144). But is he warranted in concentrating on systemic contradiction alone and in ignoring systemic compatibilities altogether? From the morphogenetic perspective contradictions, though very important, are only one of many deviation-amplifying mechanisms. To Maruyama the latter are ubiquitous: accumulation of capital in industry, evolution of living organisms, the rise of cultures of various types, interpersonal processes which produce mental illness, international conflicts, and the processes that are loosely termed as ‘vicious circles’ and ‘compound interests’: in short, all processes of mutual causal relationships that amplify an insignificant or accidental initial kick, build up deviation and diverge from the initial condition. (Maruyama 1963: 164) Obviously some of the above examples involve conflict, but ‘felicitous circles’ and ‘compound interests’ do not, yet they contribute to structure-building. The close relationship between conflict and change belongs more to the history of sociology than to theories of self-regulation in complex systems. Giddens's studious neglect of compatibilities – those relations and exchanges among components which tend to preserve or maintain a system's given form, organization or state – derives partly from his valid rejection of functional equilibration but perhaps owes more to the fact that such morphostatic processes are experienced as constraints by others in social life. Nevertheless in complex socio-cultural systems, the positive and negative feedback loops producing morphogenesis and morphostasis respectively, also circulate simultaneously. This means that Giddens provides an inherently partial account of the systemic conditions of change and stability. His attempt to bow out of this by contesting that there is ‘little point in looking for an overall theory of stability and change in social systems, since the conditions of social reproduction vary so widely between different types of society’ (1979: 215) fails on three counts. First it implies a descent into specificity (not necessarily historical uniqueness) which Giddens himself tends to eschew throughout the book. Second, in pin-pointing ‘contradiction’ as the focus of theoretical analysis he is specifying a general condition of change and to do so must have eliminated other contenders. Third, he does indeed provide an overall theory of stability, if rudimentary in form, to which we will now turn. As we have seen, the systematic underplaying of constraints artificially inflates the degrees of freedom for action. To correct this Giddens counterposes two factors which limit them, thus tempering hyperactivity and volatility, i.e. his ‘attempt to show the essential importance of tradition and routinization in social life’ (1979: 7). However while a full specification of constraints details who is limited, when and how, distinguishing these people from others with vested interests in stability, Giddens only stresses that society forms actors in general terms by inducing habitual action. Yet ‘habit’ lumps together a variety of conditions promoting stability in a way which is not only methodologically unhelpful but is also positively misleading in its implication that all that is required for destabilization is a change of habit. Thus instead of a specification of degrees of freedom related to systemic features and the action contexts they create, Giddens provides a general account of ‘deroutinization’ detached from variations in structural configurations. Primarily it is treated as a passive process in which external events (war, cultural contact, industrialization) disrupt ingrained habits. In practice this repudiates Weber's tenet, embodied in the studies of world religions, that it is only through acknowledging both the restrictions that social organization imposes on people, and the opportunities for action that are rooted in the internal instability of social structures, that we arrive at detailed theories of deroutinization, rationalization and change. At most Giddens allows that there are ‘critical situations’ or ‘critical phases’ where the drastic disruption of routine corrodes the customary behaviour of actors and heightens susceptibility to alternatives. Then ‘there is established a kind of “spot welding” of institutions that forms modes of integration which may subsequently become resistant to further change’ (1979: 229). Not only is the concept of a ‘critical situation’ dubious because of its post hoc designation, but also this formulation begs more questions than it answers. What makes a phase ‘critical’– are structural factors not always germane? What produces a particular crisis – do specific systemic features not generate distinctive crises?10 What produces subsequent resistance? Logically this cannot be attributed to the long term sedimentation of habits. Does Giddens's formulation fare any better if we look at it the other way round, i.e. not focusing on what curtails freedom (tradition and routinization), but on the conditions under which higher degrees of freedom prevail? Unfortunately this is not the case, the reason being that the ‘transformative capacity’ of actors is immediately conflated with the concept of power. On the contrary I would maintain that degrees of freedom are logically independent of the power of agents, the relationship between them being one of contingency. Systemic patterning determines a given potential for transformation, but: this may not be capitalized upon by those with the power to do so; its exploitation does not necessarily involve power; considerable power can be deployed in this context without producing any transformation. The example of our decentralized educational system should clarify points (a) and (b), for this provides considerable structural d",

Animals should base the decision to help others on expected future help, which they may judge from past behavior of their partner. Although many examples of cooperative behavior exist in nature where reciprocity may be involved, experimental evidence for strategies predicted by direct reciprocity models remains controversial; and indirect and strong reciprocity have been found only in humans so far. Here we show experimentally that cooperative behavior of female rats is influenced by prior receipt of help, irrespective of the identity of the partner. Rats that were trained in an instrumental cooperative task (pulling a stick in order to produce food for a partner) pulled more often for an unknown partner after they were helped than if they had not received help before. This alternative mechanism, called generalized reciprocity, requires no specific knowledge about the partner and may promote the evolution of cooperation among unfamiliar nonrelatives.

      "abstract": "The behaviour of a group cannot be simply reduced to the sum of the behaviour of individuals (Le Bon, 1895). Examples abound in nature: school of fish or swarms of insect act like a single individual, but with emergent properties, i.e. properties which none of the individuals in the group possess, but which appear when these individuals are grouped into a system. A key element characterising a crowd is that the individuals should know that they are part of an ensemble (Le Bon, 1895). In other words, there must be interactions between them, on a short or long range. Otherwise they only constitute a system of several isolated individuals without emergent properties. Whatever the system, it is usually much easier to access its global behaviour, compared to the behaviour of individuals and their method of communication. However, the understanding of the global behaviour, in order to be able to control it subsequently, necessarily requires the knowledge of individual behaviour and of their interactions. According to these criteria, the magnetic behaviour of structures composed of magnetic entities embedded in a non-magnetic matrix must be considered as a crowd: entities talking to each other via exchange or dipo lar interactions depending upon the distance that separates them. Therefore, the behaviour of the global (or collective) structure may differ from that of the local (or individual) entities. This difference will be accentuated in the presence of non-uniformit y (geometric, structural, etc.) of the entities. To access the magnetostatic properties of a system (coercivity, remanence, interactions, etc.), one usually uses a magnetometer to measure the major hysteresis curve.

      "abstract": "An animation character can be applied an Elasticity principle to strengthen an action and expression. That principle is called as Squash & Stretch in animation. The application of this principle gives the illusion of weight and volume to an animation character, and makes it possible that an animation action be the smooth and soft by escaping from the stiffness and rigidity. If an action of human or object on animation is expressed like a real world, it seems to be unnatural. Any action without Squash & Stretch will look rigid, uninteresting and not alive. It can be applied to movement of all objects, characters' actions, dialogues and facial expressions with a basic rule of mass, volume and gravity. Havier characters squash and stretch more than thinner ones. Any action will not be well expressed without this principle. To be a good animation movement, it should be widely applied in all type of animation, not only 2D animation.",

So it is with the action of per-ception. So it is with perception of apperception, and what it means to perceive. Traveling across tongues, leaving, as it were, can you perceive this, the trace of another’s perception in your own, Latin to French to English. To perceive: seize, understand, take entirely. The other’s tongue, in its being carried over into my mouth, knows me. I believe I take it on, make it conform to my will, to the power of my language — as if there were such a thing — when, and here is the other perception, perception that will never be mine, in imagining the other’s perception, percep-tion of the other, I perceive indirectly, I apperceive, that there, there is the other perception, perception of, on perception. In taking the other, seizing its tongue, making it conform, I take on a perception that perceives without being perceived necessarily, and which, in so doing, apprehends me.

      "title": "Spirituality and Religiosity as Correlates of Happiness among Elderly : a Gender Study",
      "abstract": "Happiness is a multidimensional construct comprising of emotional and cognitive elements. It is related with positive emotions whereas intellectual, emotional and spiritual growth balance our material pursuits and make us happy. Happiness can be achieved provided one has the wisdom of discovery, the wisdom of contentment, the wisdom of gratitude, the wisdom of giving and wisdom of self-actualization. Spirituality is to some extent an one-to-one communication with the divine without the influence of any organization or a set of dogmatic views. It is based more on personal experiences rather than the experience of others. Religion may be defined as a way of life revealed in emotional expressions and inspired by faith in God or in a supernatural power which controls and guides the action of man and the destiny of world. Man often feels that his life is incomplete and imperfect. He longs for perfection. This longing makes him to seek the help of some supernatural power which can do for him things that he cannot do for himself. Hence, the objectives of the present research were framed to study the state of happiness, spirituality and religiosity among male and female elderly and to study the relationship and contribution of spirituality and religiosity towards the state of happiness. The sample comprised of 360 elderly persons (180 males and 180 females) in the age group 65years and above, only those elderly were selected for the sample who were leading a retired life, were not suffering from any deadly disease and belonged to middle socio-economic status families. The sample was equally distributed over the three cultural zones of Punjab naming Malwa, Majha and Doaba. Data were collected through questionnaire-cum-interview method. Results revealed that significantly more happiness was perceived by elderly males as compared to their female counterparts. Positive and significant relation between spirituality and state of happiness but non-significant relation between religiosity and state of happiness among elderly were found. Correlation analysis showed positive and significant relationship of happiness with spirituality but negative and non-significant relationship of happiness with religiosity among elderly.",

The art of offerings is the art of symbols in which concrete and abstract could create artistic as well as symbols of supernatural characters; ten characters, five characters which are applicable and have different functions. And sometimes contradictory according to the needs and intended use. From these observations arose the interpretation of a meaning that, in meeting the needs of human life, basically has two major potential attractions to each other and complementary, i.e. doing structuring/restructuring or order which is oriented on the arrangement of a better life.

The concept of the balance contained in the upakara or offering means in comparison to the meaning of life phenomena that occur in society today seems to have been neglected and even abandoned. This can be proven where there has been deviation measures both the nature and the human life, among others, the exploitation of natural resources, discrimination in law and human rights, gender, and abuse of authority in the field of public administration, and will impact the spread of ecological crisis and moral degradation, as well as heighten the level of community poverty.

      "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that jealousy is unique to humans, partially because of the complex cognitions often involved in this emotion. However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some \"primordial\" form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans.",

      "title": "Time &amp; Other Dimensions",
      "abstract": "Time is complicated. One hurdle in studying the subjective experience of time is that we don’t have a sense for duration and time as we have for light (the visual system) and sound (the auditory system). However, everything we do, perceive, or cognize about is always extended in time – the way human minds work is inherently temporal. Time never occurs alone, but is embedded in context, change, and other dimensions. The studies reported in this thesis explore time in relation to other dimensions: numerosity (i.e., the total number of things given at a specific point in time), space, and human-like movement.We found that participants use different sources of information to make temporal decisions – there are different types of “timers” or strategies to extract duration information. We showed that time can be translated into different representations with only little costs in accuracy and precision. No matter how complex the to-be-timed event, observed timing performance adheres to general time perception laws. Overall, in line with the interval perception literature, we observed great flexibility in timing behavior regarding task and stimulus design. It therefore seems unlikely that there is one underlying mechanism or neural substrate (i.e., an “internal clock”) orchestrating all of this observed behavior. In the final chapter of the thesis, I discuss how there is actually no need for such an internal clock, because time is integral in all other dimensions, in the way we cognize about and interact with our environment.",

I am going to tackle absurdity in three ways: as (a) the residue left in reality after intelligibility has been exhausted; (b) the complement of intelligibility; and (c) as a mode of intelligibility (which is one of the absurdest words in the language, when you come to look at it). Although no doubt it raises all sorts of problems to talk like this, it does seem that one can meaningfully say that there is a certain intelligibility built into reality. This would appear to be involved in any doctrine of creation, whether Platonist or otherwise. To start with ‘otherwise’: in English we more naturally talk of people understanding one another, than of understanding nonpersonal objects, trees for instance; as against Platonist thought, where the object of intellection is generally non-personal. Understanding each other means, let us say, being on each other’s wavelength, speaking the same language, and so on. It has something to do with the old definition of friendship as idem sentire and so on. I see what you mean’ does not merely indicate that I, with my inner eye, perceive your meaning; it also suggests that with my outer eye I see things from your point of view, with your perspective: we share for a while a common vision.",

Because neither the expansion of science’s adequacy nor the concomitant pressure toward philosophical naturalism show signs of abating, the recent emergence of religious naturalism marks a significant moment in religious thought. Defined minimally, religious naturalism involves (1) a commitment to a naturalistic cosmology and (2) an affirmation that living in a religious way is good, important, or appropriate. Of course, this vague definition leaves room for enormous variation, and, indeed, religious naturalists vary significantly in how they interpret both of the above criteria.1 One of the most significant disagreements concerns the extent to which God-talk or reference to a transcendent ground or source of nature is employed. Thinkers who advance conceptions of Ultimate Reality—whether using Tillich’s ground of being language or Spinoza’s natura naturans2—in expressing the religiousness of their religious naturalism risk destabilizing the self-enclosure of their naturalistic cosmologies.

The inherent conservatism of unmediated, natural behavior is broken, and behavior passes on to a new, higher level of development: from a world of static things, the individual moves into what is for him a new world of object relations. A thing need no longer be merely an object toward which behavior is addressed; it can now serve as an instrument of behavior.

      "title": "Noir as Affect",
      "abstract": "Noir as Affect Christopher Breu (bio) Like most forms of popular fiction, crime fiction is known to produce affective responses in its readers. One of the defining features of most genre fiction is that it produces effects in the body, whether it is the excitement of adventure, the fear produced by horror, the arousal of pornography, or the sense of longing and fulfilment produced by romance. Indeed, popular fiction is often denigrated precisely because it produces such “vulgar” bodily affects, in contrast to the complex and distanced contemplation instilled by capital “L” literature. The production of such forms of embodied affect may be lamentable for the guardians of high art, but for scholars interested in questions of affect, popular fiction can be seen as a privileged medium. Popular fiction does not just instill affects in the reader, it also narrativizes them. Put simply, affect can be defined as that which affects a body in a given cultural, communicative or intersubjective context. They are bodily and intersubjective states that are both conscious and unconscious and are often experienced consciously as emotions or moods. Affects attach not only to characters and spaces but to the very workings of narrative itself. As psychoanalytic critics have demonstrated, central to the drive of detective fiction is the desire to know. In conventional detective fiction, this desire to know often manifests itself as a will to mastery. Thus, the classical detective narrative is premised on the movement from fear, suspense, and disorientation to mastery, clarity, and order. While the hardboiled detective story may forego much of the conventional resolution associated with the classical narrative, it too is predicated on a sense of mastery, even if this mastery is proven to be more about the toughness or endurance of the protagonist rather than any restoration of justice. Similarly, crime fiction that narrates the exploits of the master criminal, from the Memoirs of Vidocq forward, is predicated on the daring and mastery of the criminal. Whereas detective and crime fiction are finally about mastering affects (as well as mastery as an affect), noir, as a reworking of these other genres, is about the opposite. Noir is predicated on the inability of the protagonist to master the affects dramatized by the narrative. Instead, the affects typically master the protagonist (who is unmastered by them) and define the coordinates of the fictional world. Noir thus has a privileged position in understanding affect in relationship to crime and detective fiction. It demonstrates the power of affect to both shape individual actions and the larger landscape in which such actions take place. Noir takes shape as a specific affective mood or atmosphere. Central to noir is the staging of negative affects. Negativity clings to the very bones of the noir crime story. Noir works via the staging of negative affects such as guilt, sadness, (often murderous) rage, cynicism, loss, resentment, fear, anxiety, destructive desire, often including an erotic attachment to death. Initially, this definition of noir may seem counterintuitive. Noir is often associated in popular culture with a certain kind of nostalgic image of mid-twentieth-century life, featuring tough guys, femme fatales, shadows, crime, and a dangerous yet alluring urban demimonde. It is also usually associated with film, with such actors as Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Veronica Lake, Robert Mitchum, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Indeed, it has only been in the past thirty years or so that the category of the noir novel has gained critical currency in the work of Christopher Metress, James Naremore, William Marling, myself, and others. Yet, many film noirs were adaptations from crime novels that shared many of their thematic concerns and narrative structures. Moreover, the novels often were resolutely darker and more disturbing than many of their filmic counterparts, since the latter had to negotiate the Hayes code. Thus, the term noir seems to fit the novels even more fully than the films, even if the naming was belated and the films were named first, if also retrospectively, as Marc Vernet has noted. If we focus just on the noir crime novel (leaving to one side the detective novel), we can construct a timeline that begins with the writings of James M...",

Thinking in terms of untethering places a value on freedom conceived of as personal liberty and calls attention to how freedom might be pursued. Hugh rejected the psychiatrist's range of medication, and his life continued. He is excited, feels super-fortunate. He is in the right place at last, but also he is making good social connections and is trusted. Psychosis can look like performance art.

One may wonder whether it is ever possible in our ordinary lives to have an experience where the “I” is not present, or briefly, have a self-transcendent experience.  I describe below a few of my experiences of short duration that are quite ordinary with nothing mysterious about them and argue that they are all self-transcendent.  To explain how the self (ego) is present or not in an experience, I describe some properties characteristic of the self such as its sense of personal identity and ownership of action.  Manifestation of these properties in an experience indicates the presence of the self and absence of these properties indicates its absence.  In an act of observation, full attention paid to what is being observed seems to push every thought, including the self, out of the conscious mind and keep it fully occupied with the act of observation.  A characteristic property of the self-transcendent state seems to be that one can only recognize such a state as being free from the self, but one cannot prove that it is so because the outward effect of the state may be the same as that of an alternative state where the self is present.",

      "abstract": "In face-to-face communications, the occasional need for intentional lies is something with which everyone can identify. For example, when we get mad, circumstances may force us to put on a big smile instead of expressing our anger; when we feel miserable, good manners may dictate that we greet others warmly. In short, to abide by social norms, we may consciously lie. On the other hand, if we consider the signs that our bodies express as communications (body language), we can say that the body does not lie even when the mind does. Considering this phenomenon, we propose a means of \"touching the heart\" in a somewhat Japanese way by measuring the heartbeat of the \"honest\" body and using other technologies to develop a new code of non-verbal communications from a hidden dimension in society. We call this \"Meditation art\" or \"Zen art.\" \"Zen\" is Buddhist style meditation.",

Fourth, all the bicaudatus of an organism cooperate through various modes of grouping in functional correlation, in compensation, in sex linkage.

In Albert’s description of the temporal drama of human foetal life, the emergent, ‘intellectual’ energies of human psychê or anima or soul cannot be at all predicated on the material or psychic agents that give rise to them. Though standing in a real continuity with those natural, causal agents, human psyche knows itself as existing discontinuously from them and as enacting, in and through the dimension of time, kinds of knowledge and types of experience which display complex potentialities that appear to be irreducible, or, at the least, not fully measurable: in art, in science, and also in cultic action.",

Anybody who loves cats is irresistibly drawn to treat them as though they had some of the characteristics of humans. Cat owners project themselves into the heads of cats and, in so doing, empathise with them. Whether or not they are right to do so raises a big and largely unanswered question. In any event, owners will have seen their cats behave in ways that are often puzzling and enigmatic. Why are they sometimes so friendly and at other times so distant? Those who study the behaviour of cats scientifically are often asked to provide the real answers to such questions. Unfortunately, many aspects of cat behaviour that most interest the lay public have not been the subject of extensive investigation. In part this is because the implied question is: ‘Why does the animal need to behave in this way?’ This is a question about the current utility to the animal of behaving in a particular fashion and is not an easy one to answer. The question also raises questions about the evolution of the domestic cat.",

      "abstract": "Moral standing is the property by which an entity is considered to be capable of being wronged or is morally considerable. For example, when I kick a rock, I do not do anything wrong, nor is the rock wronged. On the other hand, if I kicked an innocent child, I do something wrong, but more importantly I wrong the child. I argue that sentience (the capacity to feel pleasure and pain) and rational autonomy (the conscious capacity to self-govern) are both individually sufficient for moral standing and disjunctively necessary for moral standing. I argue against a variety of alternative positions such as consciousness (the capacity to have any experience such as the color blue), biological life, and dispositional agency, in order to strengthen my position. Moral status refers to the set of normative features governing the way we treat those with moral standing. When it comes to moral status regarding moral patients, I argue that they have at least two kinds of basic moral interests which are based on their wellbeing and their autonomy. I argue in favor of a hierarchical system of moral status whereby moral patients and agents possess higher, weaker, or equal moral status based on their capacities. I conclude by arguing that we may have impersonal obligations (moral obligations owed to no moral patient) towards the environment because the natural environment may be a possible source of beauty. Thus, our moral obligation would be to beauty rather than the environment itself.",

      "title": "Complicated Exchanges: The Handling of Authorised and Unauthorised Gifts",
      "abstract": "The early modern idea of gift-giving primarily involved binding exchanges of a wide spectrum of objects with varying degrees of value. As a rule, a gift either resulted in a gift or favour in return, or expressed gratitude for a service rendered. A 1735 German encyclopedia by Johann Zedler explained: ‘Giving gifts and to receive something in return is thus not wrong ... [although] ... wisdom is required if one wishes one’s gifts to achieve the desired effect.’. While the fiction of altruistic gift-giving — corresponding to the courtly virtue of generosity — may have been maintained, there were distinct rules of gift-giving, attesting to a multitude of presents and occasions. By today’s definitions, such gifts could be classed as awards or rewards, bribes or payments. They ranged from private, individual presents for relatives or friends to prestigious, highly symbolic public presents. Some of these were gifts of honour (Ehrengaben), acknowledging peers or persons of higher status; others were known as ‘gifts of grace’ (Gnadengaben) and presented to those of lower rank, usually in recognition of some service or event. Then there were ceremonially regulated diplomatic gifts, donations to churches, monasteries and convents, prizes for festivals and contests, testamentary donations and so on. As the exchange of presents occurred purposefully, with a specified goal, it was subject to certain standards and ceremonies similar to those governing other courtly behaviour patterns. These rules were probably implicit; they were rarely written down. Occasionally there were infringements of rules, and these instances are especially revealing. Focusing principally on paintings, this paper considers the rules and handling of authorised and unauthorised royal gifts.Schencken also, daß uns der andere wieder was dagegen erweise, ist gar nichts unrechtes (...)

      "abstract": "Learning is a capacity whereby an individual undergoes a distinctive kind of change: a change of what she is able to think or do, a change either in the scope or quality of her capacities. It is widely held that the capacity for learning takes a unique shape in humans and differs from how non-human animals learn. This view is popular among philosophers, psychologists, and anthropologists. In spite of the wide agreement about its uniqueness, it remains unclear what exactly it is about human learning that makes it special. In this article, we take an Aristotelian approach and argue that the uniqueness of human learning can only be understood against the background of the human form of life. This form of life is characterized by a self-conscious relation between the form of life and its bearers. Learning is the form of the development from immature to mature bearers of the human form of life and carries the following three characteristics: It is second-personal, its content is general, and the learner's relation to the knowledge or the capacities she acquires is reflective.",

      "title": "Sensuality and Consciousness III: To Dance with Nature's Forces",
      "abstract": "In remote regions of the eastern Andaman, into the 1990s, a remarkable rapport with nature's forces was occurring.1 Most strikingly expressed during adolescence, it emerged spontaneously from a local type of consciousness. Both the capability and the underlying consciousness were conceived within a pervasive milieu of lushly sensual infant nurture.2 So dependable was the pattern of affection, it spawned a tactile language long before onset of speech. Speech, learning and sociality then followed in the eros‐driven paradigm already set. So did a rare rapport with nature's forces. With nothing in the culture to discourage it, eros was not walled‐off as children grew. It remained firmly at the root of consciousness on through teens. To be a child out in those seas was to move spontaneously and digressively out into life pursuing sundry passion pulses. When erotic power escalated during adolescence, rapport with natural forces dramatically increased. Spectacular gambolings with nature began bursting forth—sometimes astonishingly complex rhythmic ones. No clouds of moody adolescent angst discouraged spontaneity; no flattening of affect suppressed adolescent verve; no emotional dissimulation confounded purpose. Adolescence was a time for a blossoming of affect, for melding deeply and dynamically with habitat. It was a time to profoundly dance with nature's forces. Possessing a protean character, love lies more fluidly within the human frame than language. Following its own inner protocols, love seems able to evade the stable kinds of labeling required for logical inquiry. In exotic cultures it is hard to see at all. In the eastern Andaman, its workings were initially invisible to Western eyes. It was necessary to firm up subliminal awarenesses before the workings out of eros could even be detected there. Though difficult to deal with scientifically, love plays such a profound role in the affairs of humankind that it begs experimental types of scrutiny. A fracturing of love into Bacchanalian and Sublime occurred during the early Greek foundations of Western culture. Out of that schism Western ethos grew. The ethos molded the Western type of consciousness. In the eastern Andaman, eros was not cleaved at all. It shaped a type of psyche not countenanced by the West since its prehistory.",

Neither the social conventions of landscape, nor the individual constructions of landscape, nor their material foundations are stable. Rather, they are subjected to ongoing processes of change. These often take the form of dissonance, which means that changes in material space are often met with displeasure. This applies, for example, to physical manifestations of the energy transition, at times especially wind turbines. The displeasure is based on stereotypical landscape-aesthetic ideas, that are socially shared and individually updated. The formulation of this displeasure is based on sensory (besides optical also acoustic and olfactory) perceptions. In contrast phenomena, especially those associated with radiation, are beyond sensory perception. Their rejection is accordingly based less on aesthetic displeasure than on fear. We will explain and reflect on the respective interconnections exemplarily in relation to the negotiation processes surrounding the expansion of mobile networks in Germany.",

      "title": "Speaking of Elves, Dragons, and Werewolves",
      "abstract": "Abstract Much has been written on how individuals construct and maintain their identities through the stories they tell about themselves and the stories others tell about them. Often, but not always, there is enough convergence between these inner and outer stories not to cause significant conflict. However, it is also the case that certain identities are deemed more acceptable than others, and, while such acceptability may wax and wane for some identities, others remain very much marginalized and excluded. Such is the case of Other-than-human (OtH) identities—Otherkin, therians, vampires, and the like: How is it possible, and what does it mean, for an individual who is human in appearance and acting in the human world to self-identify as Otherkin—that is as an other-worldly, mythical, or fantastical creature such as an elf, dragon, or werewolf—or as therian (i.e., a this-worldly animal such as a dog, wolf, bear)? The visible disjunction between individuals’ experienced identities and the perceived reality of others raises hermeneutical issues. Following general reflections on narrative hermeneutics this chapter explores the process of “awakening”—the realization or coming to understand oneself as Otherkin or therian—and origin stories. The authors discuss OtH identities as “believed-in imaginings,” the limits of narrative acceptability, and how features of unnatural narratives might help in interpreting OtH identity narratives.",

This paper questions both the principles and the need of digging too deep into the often intangible world of high-consequence low-probability events that have the potential to impact systems and society as a whole. The engineering community has recently taken to referring to certain events as black swans, perfect storms or events caused by a priori unknowable unknowns, as if such appellation would constitute an apology for their sudden occurrence. We show that many of these metaphoric notions are either conceptually inappropriate, mostly from an epistemic point of view; or else, that they have little operational bearing on our knowledge base and on best practice rational decision-making.

      "title": "Living in the afterlife: clues from direct experiencers",
      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to obtain detailed information about the afterlife, and how discarnate entities live there by using for the first time 18 independent sources of information comprising seven selected participants claiming to be able to interview entities living in the afterlife, and eleven books written by different authors who claimed to be able to visit or communicate with entities from this dimension.The information obtained from these 18 sources was analyzed for their content consensus level using three artificial intelligence tools, namely ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to control their agreement level.Among the main common characteristics related to the afterlife, it emerged that individual consciousness continues after physical death, that the afterlife is a realm of spiritual growth and evolution, consisting of multiple levels, dimensions, or planes of existence, and that it is thoughts and emotions responsive.Differences were noted in the description of individual soul’s appearance, the natural and artificial environment, types of communications, and types of mental activity. These variations may reflect different stages of spiritual evolution or different perspectives given by entities at various levels of understanding as well as representing the limitations of human language in capturing the essence of non-physical existence.Although most of the information obtained by our different sources converge on the general description of the afterlife, and how life proceeds in these realms, they cannot be considered conclusive evidence of the afterlife and its characteristics. However, they can be used as preliminary information for future studies using different sources of information and methods of investigation.",

      "title": "Arbitrary and Natural Reinforcement",
      "abstract": "Some psychologists, experimental and otherwise, felt so strongly about aversive control that they raised their children as much as possible by positive reinforcement alone. Negative reinforcement, escape from an aversive stimulus, is very common and necessary in the natural human environment because aversive stimuli occur so widely and frequently. The reinforcement is arbitrary because there is no reinforcer currently maintaining the desired behavior or behavior similar to it in the child's repertoire. Such arbitrary social reinforcement differs in two ways from the natural reinforcer that was just described. First, the performance that is reinforced is specified narrowly rather than broadly as the large class of behaviors that can get rid of the natural aversive stimulus. A second property of arbitrary reinforcement is that the individual's current repertoire does not influence the behavior it produces nearly as much as is the case with natural reinforcers.",

      "title": "Between Mother and Child: A Response to Walter Stone's “Thinking About Our Work: The False Self”",
      "abstract": "Between Mother and Child: A Response to Walter Stone’s “Thinking About Our Work: The False Self” Bennett Roth1 issn 0362-4021 © 2014 Eastern Group Psychotherapy Society group, Vol. 38, No. 3, Fall 2014 257 1 Private practice, New York. Correspondence should be addressed to Bennett Roth, PhD, 161 West 15 Street, New York, NY 10011. E-mail: benrphd@gmail.com. Dr. Stone clearly identifies the theoretical origin of Winnicott’s early idea of the false self in the two-person early relationship between mother and child. Importantly, no maternal caretaker is perfectly attuned to her child, and maternal toleration of the child’s frustrations expressed overtly and through projections is highly variable in normal situations. Importantly, this early “link,” essential to maturation, is subject to disruption by either participant: mother or infant. Where I differ most with his description is in the translation of a two-party early relationship into the group matrix. I further disagree that such patients are limited to expressing only rage; they may express anxiety, confusion, and fear/dissociation. Kohut, also not a group therapist, extended Winnicott’s work in his investigation of narcissism, understanding narcissists as evolving out of a defensive armor around damaged inner selves; that sounds like Winnicott’s description. Kohut considered it less pathological to identify with the damaged remnants of the self than to achieve coherence through identification with an external personality at the cost of one’s own autonomous creativity. However, both Winnicott and Kohut failed to integrate dynamics of the unconscious, as Bion attempted. For some time I have been trying to understand the kind of patient, often referred for group therapy, who has “relationship” problems and how these problems in relationship are expressed in the verbal interactions of the complex group dynamics . Often such patients use self-descriptive terms such as not being able to be real, trusting, or authentic to describe their social problems with intimacy. When such patients enter a therapy group, their transference relationships in 258 roth an analytic process group are multiple: to the other members, to the group as a whole, and to the therapist. The dynamic events in a therapy group are often quite rapid and bewildering to such people, as empathic and nonempathic exchanges occur alongside defensive, authentic, and invitational dialogue. In addition, there are speakers and listeners who are affected by the goings-on such that the “therapy” takes place in multiple psychic locations. In sum, it is a stage set for interactive interpersonal problems. All this raises the question as to where the falseness of self might occur in the dance of contact, seclusion, and active participation and bystanding within the group. Can you speak of a false self without speaking of the group alliance? The group alliance rapidly shifts to and fro: from silent protective safety to authentic responses through realness; through caution to defensive protection of vulnerability; from withdrawal of participation to dissociative responses. This all occurs in differentshaped forms among the group members, depending on the emotional resonances that reflect patterns of responsiveness from inquiry to encouragement to (deeper) conflicts and identifications. Here is another problem with Dr. Stone’s one-way argument. In my experience, identificatory patterns in some patients with identity confusion, while in the therapy group, they often assume the split-off position of being the faulty, unempathic mother to other false-self patients, the internalized mother who cannot respond affectively to the vulnerability of a group member. Then there is the patient who cannot help but assume the role of the caretaker in reality, ignoring the group members’ inner needs and seeking to repair others to avoid painful emotions. Others are natural rescue seekers who often present as victims; their automatic response to challenges is to look for someone who or something that can help them avoid pain, work, or responsibility, no matter what it takes. All these may be false selves, as they appear in group therapy, offering therapeutic challenges. Finally, there is the profound question of the false self in the group therapist: a therapist who uses the group to resolve some conflict in himself or herself that has not been resolved in the therapist’s own psychotherapeutic treatment...",

A bit more needs to be said, now and later, about what we mean by a concept. We assume that mental representations have a structure not wholly unlike that of a sentence, and combine elements from a mental repertoire not wholly unlike a lexicon. These elements are mental concepts: so to speak, 'words of mentalese'. Mental concepts are relatively stable and distinct structures in the mind, comparable to entries in an encyclopaedia or permanent files in a data-base. Their occurrence in a mental representation may determine matching causal and formal (semantic or logical) relationships. On the one hand, there are relationships between the mind and the world. The activation of a concept may play a major role in causal interactions between the organism and external objects that fall under that concept. On the other hand, there are relationships among representations within the mind. The occurrence of a concept in a mental representation may play a causal role in the derivation of further representations, and may also contribute to the justification of this derivation.",

      "title": "“OM SAMEN TE STERVEN EN SAMEN TE LEVEN”",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Five questions can be raised in connection with the expression “in order to die together and to live together” in 2 Cor. 7,3. Is the subject of the infinitives “you” or “we” or both together? Should we understand the SMM-elements in these two infinitives as meaning “together”, or must we suply (with) “Christ”? How is the unusual sequence (first to die!) of the infinitives to be explained? Why is there a change of tense: from aorist to present? And what kind of death and life is referred to? The expression is the equivalent of a purpose (or consecutive) clause. Both the context 6,11–13 and 7,2–4 and the fact that the infinitives have no object point in favor of the assumption that “we and you (together)” is the subject. No object need be supplied here, neither “us” nor “you”, but also not “Christ” (against G. Stählin). The expression goes back to the language of love, friendship and service. As such, it certainly emphasizes the reality and intensity of Paul's love for the Corinthians. But Paul has rewritten, adapted and reinterpreted this profane saying. The preposition eis most probably points to a future death and life, not a death in baptism and actual Christian life. The inverted order “to die (first)—to live” strongly suggests that Paul is thinking here of a future death and the coming life after death. The change from the aorist (sunapothanein) to the present (suzên) is hardly without significance. Future death is just a passing fact, whereas life will be a lasting state of affairs and, given the context, a life without end, eternal life. Although Paul in this text is not directly making a Christological point about dying and living with Christ neither is he simply expressing his affection for the Corinthians (so many commentators). “To die together and to live together” embraces the fulness of our specifically Christian future.",

With regard to people who did not (and perhaps cannot) do anything to put us in their debt, reciprocity does not tell us what to do. It does not tell us why.

Subcortical brain modules for core processes of nonconscious “liking” and “wanting” have been revealed by affective neuroscience studies, based on behavioral affective reactions that occur even in creatures that cannot speak, such as infants or animals. Core “liking” and “wanting” may normally contribute to conscious pleasure and desire. But these core psychological processes are themselves intrinsically inaccessible and provide a basis for unconscious affective reactions. The process of “wanting” also provides insight into cases of truly irrational desire, where one wants what is neither liked nor expected to be liked.",

What then determines not simply the images and sounds that appear but their relations to each other? Much of these seem illogical, undirected, and though it is possible sometimes to perceive an association for the most part these are extremely distant and obscure even if these remote elements 'suddenly' fuse and coalesce. The film is not a representation but a manifestation, a demonstration (but of what?), a collection of documents whose order can be stated but whose significance is hard to discern. Above all, the film seems to be a record of the direct experience of making the film itself, an immediacy which results in an abundance of metaphors and signs but outside of the logical or the significant, even beyond control as if the film, in the instantaneities of its associations and linkages, has written itself.",

These events stimulate our senses, enliven our emotions, and captivate our minds. The enthronement of popes, the inauguration of presidents, the burial of heroes arrest our attention and embed memories that last a lifetime. Everyone loves sensory pageantry. Some rituals focus the attention, feed the imagination, evoke the remembrance of things past as well as the desires of things to come, and inspire dramatic actions that stand out against their everyday background. Yet the salience of such dramatic spectacles should not obscure the fact that \"ritual\" often refers to the repetition of small and thoroughly mundane acts. Even though these rituals break with the ordinary world too, they frequently remain thoroughly humdrum. They trigger automatic responses that appear to be completely mindless. If we focus on participants' psychological responses in ritual situations, we cannot fail to notice the different degrees of emotion involved in these two sorts of cases. Some rituals are so emotionally arousing that their effects seem to last forever. In other rituals emotion seems to play little, if any, role.",

      "title": "Beyond Subjectivity: Spinoza's Cognitivism of the Emotions",
      "abstract": "In what follows I try to show that Spinoza modelled his project of rational psychology, in some of its major respects, upon Descartes's metaphysics of matter. I argue further that, like Descartes, who paid for the rationalization of the science of matter the price of having to leave out of his description non-quantifiable qualities, so Spinoza left out of his psychology the non-rationalizable aspects of emotions, i.e. whatever in them could not be subsumed under common notions. He therefore was left with the cognitive aspects of emotions, keeping outside of his report the inner feeling which accompanies them. Spinoza's psychology, I claim, disregards any noncognitive aspect of emotions. 1 For most of us, emotions seem to be of a distinct nature among mental states and events. In particular, being affected by an emotion is, phenomenally speaking, a different sort of experience than having, or entertaining, a thought. Indeed, an emotion can - though perhaps it must not - involve cognition. Thus, when I love someone, I can state her look, demeanor or moral virtues as causes of this feeling. But even so, love has more to it than the cognition that provides it with an object, a reason or a causal basis. Love, and similarly other emotions, seem to have an inherent hard-core mental content peculiar to each, a content which is purely experiential, one that cannot be transcribed in words or any other means of expression that usually conveys cognitive content. Not that people cannot express their feelings - they can and they do so successfully. But there is an ineliminable gap between the content expressed and what is originally experienced. This gap is manifested in the fact that the person to whom an emotion is expressed 266does not know what the thing expressed is, unless she or he had at least once experienced a similar feeling - which fact shows that, while conveying the cognition involved in the emotion, the expression also indicates to the listener an inexpressible experiential content bound with this cognition. The listener is then supposed to regain acquaintance with the emotion out of his own inner resources - for its hard-core experiential content cannot be imparted from outside. Thus, when I say: 'I lost my hat yesterday', you gather a piece of information you did not have before I expressed it. But when I say; 'I am very frustrated having lost my hat yesterday', a feeling is successfully indicated to you if you know its kind from your own inner experience in the past. A propositional or any other cognitive content cannot replace the unique feeling one has when affected by frustration, love, envy or disappointment. Hence by expressing such content one can at best draw a recollection in the listener of his own past love, envy etc. That attempts to express an emotion often involve metaphorical usage, is a further indication of the inaptness of a report about the cognitive content involved in the emotion to conveying what the emotion truly is. Had there been to emotion nothing beyond the cognition it involves, such usages would probably have been less frequent. Now, we should distinguish two major assertions comprised in this depiction of the affective realm. One is that, having an emotion essentially involves an inner irreducible feeling that neither words, nor any other means of communicating an experiential content, can express. The other is that this hard-core content is peculiar to emotions, and that it is either lacking in other types of mental occurrences such as cognitions, or that, if other mental occurrences do similarly involve an experience not reducible to cognizable content, it is different in kind from the content involved in emotions. Coming now to Spinoza, my main point in the present paper is the following: there is no textual evidence allowing us to suppose that Spinoza would have denied that emotions - a term I will use henceforth to denote the mental aspects of Spinozistic affects, i.e. the affects considered under the attribute of thought 2 - do involve an inner feeling, irreducible to cognitive 267content. Furthermore, since the presence of such experiential content is a matter of everyday mental life, immediately accessible to any normal person, we must suppose that its denial never occurred to him as a plausible claim (if he ever gave it any thought at all). However, according to Spinoza, emotions, i.e. affects considered as modifications of our mind, are nothing but cognitions of bodily occurrences of a certain kind. Being affected by joy, love, envy, etc. is in fact having, in each case, an idea with a particular content; therefore, our inner experience of an affect or emotion is in fact our inner experience while having a certain cognition that constitutes this emotion. What we feel when we are joyous, envious etc. is an awareness of a cognitive content specific to each affect. Thus Spinoza would reject the second of the two assertions mentioned above, i.e. he would deny the peculiarity of the inner experience of emotions. Our experience of being aware to the cognitive content that constitutes an emotion is specific to each occurrence of an emotion, but it is not of a special kind distinguished from our experience of awareness to any other cognitive content, which as such is necessarily accompanied by the inner experience of awareness to it. Before pursuing my main argument, one preliminary qualification should be met with regard to the nature of the affects. Taking the emotions to be nothing but cognitions might seem to disregard their dynamic aspect, an aspect so central to Spinoza's metaphysical account of the modal realm. However, it should be born in mind that cognition, rather than a state of the mind, is itself imbued with dynamism. In fact, Spinoza emphatically claims this when, defending his definition of idea as 'a concept of the Mind that the Mind forms because it is a thinking thing' (2def3,exp), he explains that he preferred the term 'concept' (conceptus) to 'perception' (perceptio) specifically because the former 'seems to express an action of the Mind' whereas the latter does not. It thus turns out that to have an idea is to conceive of a 268cognitive content, or simply to cognize, and this should be taken to signify an activity rather than the mere having or inclusion of a content as part of some static mental inventory. Consequently, by claiming that emotions are cognitions, I grant them the active nature the latter have qua Spinozistic concepts; later on, when I treat Spinoza's definition of the affects, the specific content of their dynamic nature, in both its mental and bodily aspects, will come to the surface. 3 I start my argument by describing what I believe is a central motivation in Spinoza's theory of affects, namely, his adoption of Cartesian methodological principles, which originally operated in Descartes's metaphysics of matter. I will then try to show that it is by way of adapting these principles to his theory of mind that Spinoza reached his cognitivistic psychological theory.",

      "title": "Learned helplessness",
      "abstract": "Helplessness is a state in which nothing a person opts to do affects what is happening. It is the quitting or the give up response that follows the conviction that whatever a person does doesn't matter.[1] Learned helplessness (LH) was initially used to label the failure of certain laboratory animals to escape or avoid shock, despite giving an opportunity, subsequent to earlier exposure to unavoidable shock.[23] Now, the term has been applied to the failure of human beings to pursue, utilize, or acquire adaptive instrumental responses. It is observed in a depressed person who seems to have given up hope that effective voluntary control over important environmental events is possible.[4] People suffering from LH accept that bad things will take place and they will have little control over them.[5] Those who are exposed to complex problems for an extended period learn that responses and events are unconnected. Learning attained in this situation weakens imminent learning and leads to inactivity. Consequently, they will be unsuccessful to resolve any concern even if there is a possible solution for the concern.[6] The LH hypothesis has been reformulated as the old hypothesis does not distinguish between the outcomes that are uncontrollable for all the people and those uncontrollable only for some (universal vs. personal helplessness). It does not explain when helplessness is general or specific; chronic or acute. Reformulation states that the helplessness is attributed to a cause by people. The cause can be stable or unstable, global or specific, and internal or external.[7] Helplessness may be considered as a consequence of early socialization experiences. More specifically, the rigidity and negativism emphasized in our family systems are likely to affect the child's development of competence. A number of sociocultural features may also play their part. Hence, it is essential to explore the role of socialization as it relates to the development of child's helplessness.[6] Children who had history of abuse and neglect during their childhood and adolescence can develop a state of LH. Consequences of emotional abuse may be repeated abnormal or disrupted attachment development and the sufferer blames him/herself for the abuse, leading to LH, emotional distress, and excessively inactive behavior. Psychological abuse is often combined with other forms of abuse.[8] Children who have experienced chronic neglect are likely to have attribution models which conceptualize themselves as powerless and of low value. Neglected children are less likely to know that they are being neglected or to know that something can be done about it.[910] The capacity to cope, and thrive, subsequent to an adverse experience is often stated as resilience. A number of protective and supportive factors may contribute to an abused or neglected child's resilience. These include positive attachment, self-esteem, intelligence, emotion regulation, humor, and independence.[11] LH may be observed in the elderly, due to repeated exposure to events perceived beyond their control eventually display cognitive, motivational, and affective deficits of helplessness. The loss of self-esteem may also occur if the individual believes that he/she is personally accountable for the situations.[12] Other effects of elder abuse may include feelings such as separation, guilt, shame, fear, anxiety, and rejection.[13] The LH model gives the impression that instrumental coping behavior is the most adaptive response to threat on every occasion. Nonetheless, adaptive escape/avoidance responses are not always available for some kinds of aversive events. This is of some clinical and behavioral guidance interest to the dentists.[1415] Learned Helplessness and Dental Practice The theory of LH provides an understanding of certain noncompliant behavior observed in some of the dental patients. Patients experience a loss of self-esteem due to the feeling of helplessness and victimization, or suspicion and doubt of what the oral health-care provider says or does that can lead to communication failure.[16] History of childhood and adult trauma related to various types of abuse and neglect appears to be significantly associated with high dental fear although multiple factors play a key role. Various degrees of helplessness, powerlessness, and incidents of lack of control during dental treatments were reported. Fears of being trapped in the dental chair, claustrophobia, being unable to breathe, and feeling of chocking or severe gagging that interferes with dental treatments were reported.[17] The noise created by dental operatory can induce LH, increase arousal, alter the choice of task approach, and decrease the attention of the dental patients.[18] Dental practitioners and their auxiliaries can play distinct role in facilitating to prevent or reverse the effects of helplessness in their patients. The practitioners can enhance the perceived control of their patients, by providing them with choices that are probable and practical, which will enhance their success experience. They also need to promote autonomy and self-sufficiency in their patients, and to discard the penchant to do everything for the patients, those age/skill appropriate tasks that can be individually accomplished. Dental staff members can use these guidelines to improve the quality of their communication with their patients and can be influential in preventing or reducing the behavioral discrepancies associated with LH.[12] We have a crucial role in identifying this state of LH in our dental patients, including children, adolescents, adults, elderly, or those with special health-care needs and guide them consequently in a dental situation. Otherwise, they may continue to suffer the pain and discomfort if any, without complaining, that may lead to long term consequences.",

For, as we have already heard in this Symposium, there is abundant evidence that, in the course of evolution, intention movements, displacement activities, etc., have been developed, modified or schematized to serve as social signals or 'releasers’ for appropriate behaviour in fellow members of the species. The meaning of ritualization is also clear in human life. Here ritual is an act often repeated, especially in a ceremonial way, which represents, stands for, or symbolizes some ideas, emotions or events. The ritual acts of religion are the ideal examples where every act of a complex rite symbolizes to the participant, some significant facet of doctrine or dogma. Through the ages the acts themselves have often become simplified and stereotyped, have been reduced to a minimum, so as to mime the original idea in the simplest possible manner, often with the utmost economy of gesture.",

      "title": "Power Motivation in Sidonius Apollinaris, Eugippius, and Nonnus",
      "abstract": "Power can be thought of as the capacity to produce effects, consciously and unconsciously intended, on the behaviour and feelings of others. Power motivation arises when an individual experiences a need that can only be fulfilled by inducing appropriate behaviour in others. Ideals of service are an important means for taming or socializing power, rendering it more acceptable. This often means that a drive for power is marked by talk of duty and responsibility. The ranks of teachers, psychologists, clergymen, journalists, and urban planners contain above average numbers of people with a high power motivation. It can be hard to distinguish legitimate and necessary leadership from coercion and domination, for the latter may not be perceived as such by followers. People vary enormously in the degree to which they are prepared to challenge existing structures and norms to gain power, and they vary in their response to the attainment of power. The mere status of their position may be sufficient for some: power is not vigorously or selfishly exercised, nor is it conspicuously displayed. There may be present a fear of power, i.e., a fear of abusing it, which is defended against by maintaining that power is not one's own but a gift of grace to be used for the benefit of others. Charismatic or messianic leaders often make this claim. They are able to enhance the self-esteem of followers by providing a potent object of identification, and they lead by making their followers feel powerful rather than by commanding them. Identifying with any winner or hero, whether sporting, religious, or political, provides a vicarious experience of power. The need for power, therefore, is not only about a drive to influence others. Alcohol consumption induces a feeling of power. For those frustrated in their hopes of gaining real power, it offers a substitute, as do sex and violent behaviour. A drive for personalized power may be accompanied by high alcohol consumption, low inhibition of impulses, and, more so than socialized power, it has a present orientation, a moment-by-moment quality that has to be constantly reaffirmed. Gambling offers opportunities to impress and to win in the short run. A socialized power drive is characterized by low alcohol consumption and high inhibition, and may be advertized by dietary and sexual asceticism.",

A disorder of eating, drinking, and swallowing challenges the nutritional intake, affecting the physical and mental health as well as social well-being of the child. The development of orally and nasally spoken speech sounds, require resonance within their respective cavities, to enhance the audibility of the sounds to the listener. Disorder of speech is evident through hypernasality, hyponasality, or mixed nasality, and inappropriate or displaced resonance accompanied by misarticulation of speech sounds. It may be said here that a cleft palate causes more concern than the cleft lip, as the latter poses a bigger cosmetic problem, than the one pertaining to malfunctioning of the speech mechanism.",

Talking furniture on children's TV, vegetable mascots for city governments, an animated letter ‘e’ to promote online tax returns—there seems to be no limit to what can be anthropomorphized, and no corner of the culture where it is considered out of place. This of course includes efforts to communicate science, where we can find test tube narrators, angry viruses, friendly chemical elements, and a whole lot more. Scientists, on the other hand, are less enthusiastic about anthropomorphism in scientific discussions and tend to consider it to be inaccurate and unscientific. In science, thinking or communicating in anthropomorphic terms is generally derided. Where, then, does this leave the talking microbes and smiling proteins of Japanese science communication? While the literature has quite a lot to say about anthropomorphism, there is nothing specifically about its use for science communication. This paper draws on examples from Japan to consider the potential roles of anthropomorphism in the communication of science and related issues.",

      "abstract": "Fashion and identity are deeply intertwined with one another and in situated performativity, entailing not only individuals but atmospheres and relations to others and the Other. Something drawn upon by fashion retail, perhaps most noticeably through mannequins (living or dolls). Comparatively, fashion museums can be argued to have difficulties evoking similar reactions and participation even though often ostensibly operating with the same tools.This can be argued to depend on a number of factors, including degrees of interactivity and directionality. While mannequin dolls are seldom directly for interaction, their incarnation in commercial space represent interactivity to commodities in, within, and through spaces around them, and they have a temporal as well as an ownership directionality that proposes identities and identification. The logic of the mannequin, as Vanessa Osborne names it, is dependent on this, as well as an abstracted or de-personalized character of the mannequins, requiring the viewer to participate through completion, often involving placing oneself in the mannequin’s place.A situated experience rather than a person-object relation architecture, atmosphere, other mannequins, and other consumers participate. Thus the understanding of the mannequin can be said to be dependent on understanding its situatedness on a stage of multiple actors and actants where consumers complete the composition, much like Giovanna Stavroulaki and John Peponis observes the choreography of statues in Castlevecchio demands the visitor to complete their internal, configuratively staged narrative.By balancing the concrete and the abstract, providing enough information to trigger reading but not enough for stable interpretation, these situated presentations draw upon the viewer‟s imagination, allowing and requiring completion. In this sense, the mannequins perform diagrammatic operations, as discussed by Gilles Châtelet, but ones situated in space as almost bodies, almost persons.The recent exhibition at the Dance Museum, Stockohlm, Koroly’s Costume Drama, offered a unique opportunity to investigate this in-betweenness, as well as questions of situatedness, abstraction, expression, atmosphere, and various forms of interaction – from directly completing or participating in the staged drama to ignoring them altogether, to treating them „as is‟; that is, as inanimate objects. As few other exhibitions it allowed touch and interaction, and the staging was elaborate, dramatic, and playful. It allowed questions of architectural staging, situation, identity, and the curious operations performed by the mannequin dolls to be investigated in hands on experiments, upon which this presentation elaborates, comparing to material on mannequins in commercial as well as traditional museum environments.",

      "abstract": "The case discussed here illustrates one type of transsexual wish. The paper clarifies the dynamic considerations and treatment process in a patient who was psychotic and who, from time to time, wished to change his sex. One of the patient's chief difficulties was an inability to regulate adequately the intrapsychic distance between the self and objects. In the relatively nonpsychotic state, the patient used coercive behavior and splitting to establish a tenuous balance between fusing with the object and losing it entirely. When these defenses were adequate, the patient did not experience wishes to be a woman. However, when threatened with the loss of an important internal object (the mother or therapist), the patient would attempt to fuse with the object by experiencing strong transsexual wishes. The wish thus served to stabilize and control internal objects at a comfortable distance. The wish also served a restitutive function, holding off a frightening psychotic state; a loss of an important object threatened the patient with feelings of fragmentation. It was thus somewhat similar to a delusion or hallucination.",

      "abstract": "We can think of an apparent continuum of behavior and actions that starts from the most fully deliberated actions of human beings in one extreme and ends at the other extreme at the movement of the “dumb” animals. The scholastic view seems to be at its best in dealing with one end of the spectrum: fully deliberated actions performed by reasonable agents at their most reflective moments. I hope to show, however, that it can also account for a wide range of human behavior that includes merely intentional and merely voluntary actions. However, as we approach the other end of the spectrum, the scholastic view might seem to be in a poor position; in fact, it may seem that it is completely inadequate to explain the actions of the perverse, the odd or mentally ill, children, and other mammals. And one could argue that a view that tries to understand human action in a way that cannot accommodate these instances of human and nonhuman action cannot claim success. After all, the fact that there is such a continuum seems to speak in favor of a unified explanation for the whole spectrum of animal behavior.",

      "title": "Social and physical reasoning in human-reared chimpanzees : preliminary studies",
      "abstract": "A challenging issue in the comparative and developmental literature concerns the effort to define and describe the underlying nature of concepts and representations. This volume represents an attempt to define perception, and what it might mean for an organism to have a “theory of perception.” Typically, if an organism is able to differentiate between different objects, making operational choices between them, that organism is said to have an understanding of the objects’ different properties, or at least to have discriminated between them in a meaningful way. If the organism can predict that different objects will have differential effects on the world that organism may be said to have some limited causal understanding. Adding complexity to the study of such topics is the issue of implicit versus explicit levels of understanding. To act on objects in the world in meaningfully different ways is not necessarily functionally equivalent to reflecting on those objects, or one’s own actions, in a conscious or metacognitive manner. As evolutionary psychologists, our focus has been to understand how our closest living relatives may be both similar to and different from humans in their approach to solving social and physical problems. We have previously proposed that one critical way in which non-humans, even the other apes, may differ from humans, is in their ability to represent and reason about unobservables (Povinelli, 2004; Vonk and Povinelli, 2006). We posit that to have a true “theory” of objects or other organisms (whether it be a theory of perception or a theory of mind), an organism must represent",

In this paper, I will specifically focus on presenting phenomenological descriptions of body memories of relevance for dance practices. I would like to emphasise that the ways that different kinds of memory are meshed in the many contexts of our habitual actions is central for the descriptions of the dancers’ memory of habits and skills A large part of dancers’ practices are, in different ways, focused on developing, adjusting and optimising certain techniques of the body (as specialised habits) according to criteria of the artistic field. I contend that it would be a mistake to think of these body techniques – or specialised habits – as a repertoire of more or less automatised movements. Rather, in each repetition, habits are to be understood as unfolding in response to the present context and accordingly instantiate a fresh memory of these habits while moulding them at the same time. In sociological discussions, several researchers have drawn attention to the facts that when exploring, and possibly changing, habits, we at the same time rely on other habits and that habit does not only include sensory-motor use of our bodies, but also the way we handle our attention and focus our awareness. Habits are thus the necessary foundation on which improvisations can exist. The unfolding of any habit is itself partly improvised in response to specific contextual demands. I will therefor also argue that dance improvisation can then only be understood when taking into consideration its complex relation to habits and body memory.",

Mediterranean diet fits on these two concepts. The question is if we are measuring Mediterranean diet as a whole, or whether we are only measuring one of its parts, neglecting the rest of components.

      "abstract": "Faces are the most important social signal in our society. Nevertheless, there is a problem with faces: they are all made up of the same features in the same general order (the eyes are above the nose, which is above the mouth). To process faces one uses a special kind of processing, which is holistic, considering the integration of the face’s features and their relative distances. One may distinguish the recognition of known faces and the processing of unfamiliar faces. Face processing abilities may be lost due to either a lesion or developmental reasons, i.e., prosopagnosia. To further explore these reasons, one could consider pictorial representations of faces—such as faces in paintings. These are particularly interesting because different art styles differ in how realistic/distorted they are relative to real faces, which allows for exploring people’s sensitivity to face-likeness. In a way, individuals are not sensitive to face-likeness. In face matching part–whole tasks, performance does not differ across art styles. Still, individuals are not fully impervious to distortion: early markers of face processing (N170 component) are sensitive to face-likeness, with more realistic (vs. distorted) art styles eliciting responses more in line with those of real faces.",

As a result, a character fights against the fatal forces or loses his/her will - falls without unconscious (the most frequent reaction), begs for mercy or runs away.

      "abstract": "Adulteration is the wilful addition to an article of any substance or substances the presence of which is not acknowledged in the description under which the article is sold, or the abstraction from an article of an essential constituent without disclosing that it is impoverished. Some common synonyms are: corruption, defilement, debasement, vitiation and sophistication, all of which indicate the sinister nature of the act. Articles are adulterated to increase their weight or bulk, and to improve or change their appearance or flavour in imitation of an article of higher grade or different kind. In the limiting case it can be regarded as covering the complete substitution of one article for another. Wilful addition implies addition which could have been avoided and hence covers contamination brought about by lack of care. The term is used mainly in connexion with foods and drugs, but in practice extends to almost all manufactured products and is an almost inseparable accompaniment of trade competition. It will be observed that there are two requirements for adulteration, viz. an action and an intention. The mere act of mixing one thing with another does not, in itself, warrant the term adulteration. It must be coupled with an intention to deceive by passing off the mixed article as if it were unmixed. The intention is usually not apparent until some circumstance warrants the inference, such as the sale or exposure for sale of the article. The inclusion of such concepts as wilfulness and intention, which are much more difficult to prove than facts, introduces difficulties and prevents in practice the employment of a simple definition without provisions being made to protect the honest man from injustice. Accidental contamination or impurities unavoidably present, if not due to neglect or lack of reasonable care, are not normally regarded as adulteration unless the impurity is dangerous to health. In this country the only law which deals directly with adulteration is the Food and Drugs Act. The present Act, that of 1938, prohibits :—",

      "title": "Spatial Patterning of Pines and Oaks in the New Jersey Pine Barrens",
      "abstract": "The spatial patterning of individuals in a community can provide evidence of dynamic interactive forces of ecological importance within and between populations. Three patterns are possible: (1) uniform, (2) random, and (3) clumped (Hutchinson 1953). Patterns which are uniform are best interpreted as indicating repulsive forces (e.g. competition) among the individual organisms because mosaic substrates which are statically or dynamically uniform are improbable. In contrast, the interpretation of clumped patterns is ambiguous because clumping can be generated by attractive forces among individuals (e.g. mutualisms) or a heterogeneous environment in which the organisms live. In plants inefficient seed dispersal can lead to clustering of seedlings around the parent plant. The lack of significant patterning (i.e. patterns not statistically different from random) is not proof that important interactive forces are inoperative; disturbance factors such as stochastic vagaries of climate, severe fire, or rampant predation may simply be stronger than the forces of biotic interaction or the underlying patterns of the substrate. The spatial patterns of pines and oaks in the New Jersey Pine Barrens were measured for evidence of competition among natural populations. This remarkable biome was selected because the pine-oak forest is strikingly homogeneous over a large area, and the pattern of trees appeared uniform, in contrast to the usual clumping of plant dispersions (Greig-Smith 1964). A genuine tendency toward uniformity would indicate the existence of competition or other ecologically important negative interactions among individuals. A second motivation for the study was the quantitative documentation of the spatial patterning and the relative abundance of tree species in selected sites of the Pine Barrens after a known period of time since the last forest fire. Repeated at regular intervals, the set of such studies can provide information about the dynamics of upland Pine Barrens succession. Very little quantitative or experimental work has been carried out on plant population dynamics or community structure in the Pine Barrens (Wood 1938; Little & Moore 1949; Buell & Cantlon 1950, 1953; Andresen 1959) compared to the large literature on the endemic fauna and flora (see Stone 1911; Harshberger 1916; McCormick 1970 for reviews).",

      "abstract": "In the early stages of ontogenesis, when thesupport for development relies upon the relational function of the mother–baby dyad, the child will organise the foundation of the Self. This process involves a physiological and emotional symbiosis, in a relation with predominance of a tonic-emotional dialogue. The presence or absence of the other, the dynamics of nearness/farness, the postural and gestural dynamics, the containment activities, rhythmic synchronicities and thermal contact, are essential supports to primary organization of the psyche. When these processes are inadequate, they can cause problems of individuation and affirmation of identity, linked to absences or deficiencies in the primary relationship between mother and baby. This perspective leads us to equate the importance of corporeality in the early processes of communication when they are mediated primarily by tonic-emotional processes of communication, imbued with affections, desires and emotions. These processes are essential to the organization of the internal processes that make up this pre-linguistic phase, based on the organization of body schema, ensuring a sense of identity and the possibility of individuation and differentiation from the maternal object. When there are disruptions in this evolutionary dynamics, psychomotor therapy is a privileged resource, providing a safe and container space in which through spontaneous and symbolic play, children learn to transform the feelings, acts and affections in thoughts, projects and words. A desired relationship, allows to experience new forms of expression and conflict resolution, improving emotional and behavioural regulation, and promoting mentoring capacity and executive functions (such as attention, working memory, planning and inhibition of impulses).",

      "abstract": "The living social reality was for Cooley the society of which he was a part, which he approached by objective introspection. Society is an affair of a consciousness that is necessarily social. The self is not a presupposition of consciousness but arises in communication and is dependent on others who are as immediate as the self. In imagination both self and other have their origin. Public consciousness is the organization of the separate individual experiences. The self is not an immediate character of the mind, for we are not first individual and then social; the mind itself arises through communication. This represents an advance on Baldwin, Tarde, and even James. A self that can reach other selves only through the interpretation of states of consciousness can never be primarily a social self. A difficulty arises when the parallelism of \"ordinary psychology\" is accepted by Cooley. His ethical views ignored primitive impulses and insisted on standards already established. He was not interested in the scientific study of society. But does not the self belong to an objective phase in the tendency to take the role of another? Cooley did not find selves and society arising in primitive processes of communication so that he could grasp their reality in early human behavior. His sociology was in a sense an account of the American community to which he belonged. The gospel of Jesus and democracy were of the essence of it. But if we carry back the social behavior to a point which antedates the psychical as distinct from an outer world, it is to this primitive behavior that one can trace the social patterns that produce society as well as to criticism and reconstruction. To this type of analysis Cooley's assumption closes the door. But Cooley's establishment of the self and others on the same plane of reality and his impressive study of the primary group are positive accomplishments for which we are profoundly indebted.",

The focus of this chapter is the third of those sets of options. More precisely, it is concerned with some of the ways in which scientism in some prominent views of the relationship between minds, brains and persons, and of the body, genes and athletic performance, seems to contribute to the development and perpetuation of a conception of performance enhancement in sport that frequently seems to be to the detriment of the welfare of athletes. The reductionism evident in scientistic conceptions of the athlete not only paves the way for pictures, reasoning and values that might justify performance enhancement practices (prohibited or otherwise) that may be detrimental to the health and welfare of the athlete, but it creates conditions that render any apparent 'achievement' hollow, and the realisation of that should surely negatively affect the welfare of the individual person long beyond the point he or she ceases to be an athlete.",

      "abstract": "Narratological studies have quite frequently focused upon linguistic structures, considered to be paradigmatic cases of narrativity, whereas pictorial signs (such as icons and symbols) or indices have received comparably much less attention. In this paper, however, I intend to outline some basic and regularly occurring narrative aspects of pictures and non-pictorial objects. As a point of departure, I shall suggest (influenced by approaches from cognitive psychology, e.g. the work of Roger Schank) that cognition basically consists of the storage and retrieval of action scripts or schemata (i.e. narrative structures) which may occur on various levels of abstraction. These schemas incorporate generalized knowledge about event sequences (e.g. the order in which specific events will take place; causal, enabling, or conventionalized relations between these events, and what kind of events occur at all in certain action sequences). Moreover, there are also scene schemas which are rather characterized by spatial than temporal relations. This means that we have mentally stored inventory information, i.e. what kinds of objects normally appear in such situations, as well as spatial-relation information, i.e. concerning the usual spatial layout of a scene. Through previous experiences we acquire a large amount of such culturally based event and scene stereotypes (along with idiosyncratic variations), either due to our previously acquired, direct familiarity with instances of events, or due to our acquaintance with written, oral, and of course pictorial descriptions of them (e.g. religious or mythological tales). They include settings, sub-goals, and actions in attempting to reach specific goals. The production and comprehension of pictorial signs, as I will claim, is frequently based upon the existence and activation of such mentally stored action and scene schemas on part of the beholders. Actually, even things in general, whether artificial or natural objects, are capable of expressing or triggering such narrative structures, thus “telling us stories”. In this paper, I shall present some examples of pictures and non-pictorial objects where narrative structures become activated and, indeed, their recognisability and comprehensibility as such presupposes these structures.

This latter function of architectural design has strong but modifiable effects on social behaviour and users' mood and productivity and, to some extent, design features also affect health and wellbeing. Too often, however, these important sources of influence are ignored or not recognized, despite repeated demonstrations of these effects. While much remains to be done, research has identified several architectural features that appear to be associated with mood and health. Design characteristics or the way space is structured, presence or absence of windows and illumination all appear to affect people. For some features, the relationship to health is indirect (e.g. small, crowded work spaces may result in stress that may in turn affect health) while for other features the relationship to health is more direct (e.g. eye strain from poor lighting, illness from exposure to fumes).",

Although each is an important project in its own right, each misses opportunities to stress the links between nature and health. Each, that is, suffers from the ecomedical disconnection syndrome. In neurological parlance, a disconnection syndrome occurs when one brain center (or neural information processing unit) cannot communicate with another, and some form of integrative impairment results. For example, when visual processing and language areas are isolated from each other by a brain lesion, such as a stroke, the patient may not be able to name pictures. We should be wary of medicalizing language, of course, but thinking about the current state of bioethics through the neurological concept of disconnection is appropriate, for the problem is one of human cognitive limitations. Our patient suffering from this disconnection syndrome is not really The Hastings Center but rather environmental science and medicine in general. Bridging medical and ecological ethics must be a critical aspect of the future of health and environmental planning and, in fact, of our species and others. The present commentary draws on Van Rensselaer Potter's original conception of bioethics as a broad exploration of the linkages between biology and human values to characterize the syndrome and develop a treatment plan. Its most expansive aspiration is to contribute to the development of viable programs of sustainable medicines in a sustainable environment. The Diagnosis The principal purpose of the Nature, Polis, Ethics project is to guide the future development of the Chicago region as a place in which human beings and other species can live and thrive. In the process of highlighting the moral issues in regional planning efforts, Nature, Polis, Ethics empowers a variety of modes of thought that too often are not conjoined. First, it empowers history, that is to say, an understanding of the past of the region and its human inhabitants. This history recounts not only the growth of human influence in the region, but the community values that led to and emerged from this development process. Second, the project empowers the notion of citizenship, particularly democratic ecological citizenship. At the root of this citizenship are fundamental values like trust, particularly in other members of the community, as well as faith in the enterprise itself, and perhaps in matters spiritual as well. Third, it empowers evolutionary biology as one of the critical underpinnings of our knowledge of how the region has evolved and might evolve. Yet despite the emphasis on biology, there is a major theoretical and practical omission: health concepts, institutions, and professionals are left out of the account. The environment has been and will continue to be dramatically affected by the delivery of health care for citizens of the region. For example, the use or misuse of antibiotics by physicians and the use or misuse of community resources such as space and waste processing facilities by hospitals have profound effects on the environment. The success of public health (with some occasionally significant help from medicine) in increasing the lifespan of individuals has made the problem not just a matter of general overpopulation but has caused a change in the average age of our citizens. …",

      "title": "HASID AND HARHAM ? PARADOXICAL STORIES FOUND IN THE CABBALISTIC ETHICAL LITERATURE*",
      "abstract": "The heart of the paradoxical tale is a reversal of expectations. In some stories of this nature, the person who is least expected to be seen to have or to acquire a role of exalted significance in reality does have or does attain such a role. Or, such a person might come to be looked upon as an ideal figure frequently at the expense of those situated at a society's center. This kind of tale is, understandably, often viewed as emerging from the more marginal sectors of a population whose members possess neither authority nor status in their societies. In various Jewish tales of such a paradoxical character, the posited center of Jewish society is identified with the institu tions of Torah-learning, while the more marginal members are those who are basically unlearned, lacking the benefits of study and sometimes lacking even a familiarity with the accepted norms of religious life and behavior.1 In such tales, God is impressed not with the wealth of one's knowledge, but rather with the depth of inner intent which is itself not contingent upon knowledge. If such paradoxical stories reflect social protest, they also voice a pietistic strain in Jewish thought and teaching which emphasized the importance of inner intent and spirituality and which regarded Torah-learning and knowl edge as seriously wanting if unaccompanied by the qualities of personal piety. The Cabbalistic ethical literature of the sixteenth through the mid eighteenth centuries, popular pietistic writings which essentially distilled the particular mode of Jewish mysticism which emerged in sixteenth-century Safed into a form intended for large numbers of Jews, includes various tales which, prior to or following analysis, can be identified as paradoxical stories. These stories generally establish, on some level, a polarity between the hakham, the learned sage, and the hasid, the devout Jew whose way in life is not necessarily dependent upon intellectual attainment or who transcends the value of learning per se. In some examples,2 that polarity is thoroughly explicit. But in others either only one of the figures of this polarity might actually be present in the tale, the two worlds of values might even be present within the same person, or the contrast between the figures defined in those terms might be quite implicit. These stories can be read only with the more normative scale of values (e.g., extolling the scholar and the place of Torah learning, with its expectations and responses) in the background of the tale, a norm which the story serves to negate or to refine. These stories either define the values of the hasid as indispensible to the ideal of the hakham in its completeness or assert the priority of the value-complex of the hasid over that of the hakham. In analyzing four such stories and focusing upon the implications of some of the relationships within the stories, our ultimate concern will be to seek an explanation for the affinity of Jewish mysticism of the sixteenth century and of following centuries for the paradoxical tale, an affinity which goes beyond the sociological impact of the stories and even beyond the ideology of pietism itself; it is an affinity which has to do more with the essential and underlying ethos of the period. 52",

      "title": "Conversion and dissociation disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Of all the disorders characterized by symptoms in the absence of disease, conversion disorders are perhaps the most difficult to explain. How, for example, can one explain functional blindness or a loss of function of both legs in the absence of conspicuous organic disease? The ancient Greeks recognized that if we suffer emotional disturbance as a result of some serious stress (such as personal injury or bereavement), this causes a change in the nervous system which leads in turn to symptoms in different parts of the body according to the underlying pathophysiology. Nineteenth century neurologists made significant advances when they identified specific ideas at the root of the symptoms. In the early nineteenth century Collie also observed that the significance of, and attention to, a symptom or set of symptoms may depend more on what they mean (or their value) to the individual than on the biological underpinnings of the symptom itself. Spence has recently argued that the problem in hysterical motor disorders is not the voluntary motor system per se: rather, it is in the way that the motor system is utilized in the performance (or non-performance) of certain willed, chosen, actions. This model invokes a consciousness that acts upon the body and the world. By contrast, the psychodynamic (‘conversion’) model, which Freud introduced and which held sway for most of the twentieth century, invokes an unconscious mechanism ‘acting’ independently of consciousness, to interfere with voluntary movement. Spence has further argued that hysterical paralyses are maintained not by unconscious mechanisms, but by conscious processes. The maintenance of these symptoms requires the patient's attention, a characteristic of higher motor acts; the paralyses break down when the subject is distracted, consciousness is obtunded, or when it (the ‘paralyses’) is circumvented by reflexive motor routines. Hysterical paralyses, Spence avers, are quintessentially disorders of action (or inactions), which the patient disavows, when faced with some overwhelming situation, which threatens the identity of the self. One regrettable development of psychiatry's adoption of Freudian theory was the fracture in communication between the disciplines of psychiatry and neurology, which has only recently been restored by the sort of collaborative research currently being carried out by neurologists and psychiatrists. In the last decade there have also been exciting advances in neuroimaging, which have stimulated research into the neurophysiology of hysteria, and these will be described later. This chapter will also emphasize contemporary approaches to management of these difficult clinical problems.",

      "title": "Altruism and Biology",
      "abstract": "Abstract In the vernacular, “altruism” is a psychological term; its application depends on the motives with which an action is performed. A's action is altruistic if and only if A's ultimate motive in performing the action is the furtherance of some other individual's (or individuals') welfare. A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, the other individual receives no benefit (because of some unforeseen interference, say). And A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, A (and A alone) benefits from the action, so long as that outcome was not A's ultimate motive. If A acts to benefit B but A's ultimate motive for doing so is that furthering B's welfare promises in turn to benefit A (via boosting A's reputation, say), then A's action is not altruistic but selfish. On the face of it, there is no reason to assume that this distinction is exhaustive. It seems possible that actions can be done for motives that have nothing to do with benefiting anyone, or can be done for mixed motives where benefits to both actor and other are important motivating factors but neither is ultimate.",

Laughter punctuates speech and is not typically humor related, speakers often laugh more often than their audience, and male speakers are the best laugh getters. Laughter evolved from the labored breathing of physical play, with the characteristic “pant-pant” laugh of chimpanzees and derivative “ha-ha” of humans signaling (“ritualizing”) its rowdy origin. Laughter reveals that breath control is why humans can speak and chimpanzees cannot. The evolution of bipedality in human ancestors freed the thorax of its support role in quadrupedal locomotion, a critical step in uncoupling breathing from running, providing humans with the flexible breath control necessary for speech and our characteristic laugh. Tickle, an ancient laughter stimulus, is a means of communication between preverbal infants and mothers, and between friends, family, and lovers. Because you cannot tickle yourself, tickle involves a neurological self/nonself discrimination, providing the most primitive social scenario.",

      "title": "Forgiveness: A Quiet Assault on the Malicious",
      "abstract": "Forgiveness is the self's quiet assault on the power of the malicious and the injurious. Its aim is to repair or mitigate the breaches and fractures the malicious and the injurious create within the self, between the self and other(s), and across the social order. It does this in two ways: publicly, as a ritualised speech-act, wherein forgiveness forges a special form of recognition, in which recognition of oneself as one who forgives stands in for and displaces various forms of non-recognition by the other(s); and privately, as a form of affective reattunement, in which a 'decathexis' of the breach wrought by the malicious releases the self from an imposed shame and facilitates the reassertion of a self which has affirmatively assimilated injury, a process necessary for its release. For forgiveness to be fully functional, it needs to operate both publicly and privately, both as a ritual speech-act and as a manifestation of affective reattunement. Publicly, it needs to operate as a ritual and not as a transaction, because forgiveness, unlike a transaction, can neither require nor demand reciprocity. As Paul Ricoeur might have said, forgiveness, as public ritual is a form of imputation, a way of holding the other accountable, yet it still must be able to function under conditions of non-reciprocity. Forgiveness always operates in the ineluctable possibility of its repudiation by the other. It functions as a ritual affirmation that itself refuses to recognize the other's power of negation; as ritualised speech-act, it imposes its own version of things on the other beyond the other's power of negation, something a transaction, enmeshed in the logic of exchange, cannot achieve. Public rituals of forgiveness, in spite of this structural nonreciprocity, hold the other accountable even in the act of releasement of that accountability, a releasement that, ephemerally, negates the ongoing force that the malicious or injurious purports to have. It does this in two ways: first, by verbally taking on and naming what is not one's own – the other's malevolence, indifference or harm – and releasing the self socially from the stigmatising traces of those capacities; and, second, by speaking into being a version of self and a form of social dignity that negates and survives the malicious. Privately, forgiveness involves affective reattunement, which begins with a decathexis of the breach in self-wrought by the malicious or the injurious. This entails an affective releasing of the psychic wound whose splitting force has generated a new, fractured identity-possibility for the self. While the breach may well be stigmatised psychically, in order for forgiveness to occur the self that has become simultaneously fractured and organized by an injurious breach must destigmatise that breach; that is, the self must withdraw investments in the identity possibilities constituted by psychic injury and the rectitude that transforms such injury into victimhood and identity formation. This involves the self's assimilation and release of the shame wrought by injury and malice. And this assimilation is itself a negation of the power of the malicious, a form of non-recognition that negates. Forgiveness, then, in its twofold structure – as public ritual and speech-act, and as affective reattunement – enables the self to generate an event and a condition of being that, at least ephemerally, negates much of the retroactive and ongoing force of the malicious and the injurious.",

      "abstract": "The capacity of the infant to bear affect relies on the capacity of the caregiver until it has achieved enough strength to perform this task itself. In the case of neglect the necessary strength to contain, metabolize and think about affect so that it may be converted into differentiated feelings cannot develop because of the absence of a caregiver capable of sustaining the infant in its emotional development. Instead a system of defence against affect arises in which the affect itself is perceived as intrusive and abusive. Because of neglect a confusion between abuse and affect can be observed, with catastrophic consequences for the growing child. Furthermore neglected children can be seduced by external abuse in the hope of being protected from affect that threatens to feel abusive from within. Paradoxically these children are drawn toward abusive situations in the hope of finding some ongoing shelter from unmanageable affect. A corollary of this is that actual containment comes to feel abusive to them: if they are made to feel affect, they perceive the other, who put them in touch with affect, as abusive: thus affect, abuse and containment are confused. Clinical material will support this thesis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Do nonhuman animals (henceforth, animals) have emotions, and if so, are these similar to ours? This opinion piece aims to add to the recent debate about this question and provides a critical re-evaluation of what can be concluded about animal and human emotions. Emotions, and their cognitive interpretation, i.e., feelings, serve important survival functions. Emotions, we believe, can exist without feelings and are unconsciously influencing our behavior more than we think, and possibly more so than feelings do. Given that emotions are expressed in body and brain, they can be inferred from these measures. We view feelings primarily as private states, which may be similar across closely related species but remain mostly inaccessible to science. Still, combining data acquired through behavioral observation with data obtained from noninvasive techniques (e.g., eyetracking, thermography, hormonal samples) and from cognitive tasks (e.g., decision-making paradigms, cognitive bias, attentional bias) provides new information about the inner states of animals, and possibly about their feelings as well. Given that many other species show behavioral, neurophysiological, hormonal, and cognitive responses to valenced stimuli equivalent to human responses, it seems logical to speak of animal emotions and sometimes even of animal feelings. At the very least, the contemporary multi-method approach allows us to get closer than ever before. We conclude with recommendations on how the field should move forward.",

      "abstract": "There is clear and robust evidence of the importance of going outdoors to the health and wellbeing of older people. However, modern technologies have enabled more and more of the outside world to be brought inside. Though, it can be hypothesised that this is a poor substitute for literally being outdoors, little is understood as to why this is, not how much of the outdoors could be re-presented indoors to give benefits. This chapter briefly gives examples of how new technologies can bring the outdoors inside and potential advantages of doing that to help older people stay connected to other people and the outside world. It highlights what is still missing from literally engaging with the outdoor world, for example the social connection with other people, random-chance encounters with others, over reliance on visual representation and a lack of control. The absence of the mundane in many of the re-presentations of the outdoor world is also evident and this appears to be important in literal interactions with the outside world. Nevertheless, there appears to be great promise in connecting people to the outside world without literally having to go outdoors, especially for those with mobility impairments who are unable to get out and about.",

      "title": "Influence of Spirituality on Quality of Life among Adults",
      "abstract": "The English word 'spirit' is derived from the Latin word 'spiritus' which means air, life or courage. Referring to this concept it may be said that spirituality is a way to discover the meaning of our life and to live with a faith that provides courage to face adverse circumstances. It is a subjective and elusive phenomenon that enables people to find out the reason of their existence. Many people confuse spirituality with religiosity but spirituality is a broader, overarching domain that may include religiosity, but religiosity is not a necessary element of spirituality (Cooper- Effa, Blount, Kaslow, Rothenberg, & Eckman, 2001 ; Estanek, 2006). Religion refers to the means and methods (i.e., rituals or prescribed behaviors) of the search that receive validation and support from within an identifiable group of people. According to Koenig, McCullough and Larson (2001) is the personal quest for understanding answers to ultimate questions about life, about meaning, and about relationship to the sacred or transcendent, which may (or may not) lead to or arise from the development of religious rituals and the formation of community. It may be said that spirituality is a set of beliefs and practices that can result in a life changing path that makes a person's life meaningful, purposeful. Spirituality has always been viewed as an important factor in realizing an adequate quality of life. Spirituality has been regarded as something that contributes to human flourishing, something that increase the quality of life. For instance Levin(2001) pointed out that spirituality engenders our emotions, thoughts, and beliefs that alleviate distress. Kass (1996) is one of the opinion that tapping one's spiritual core can boast self concept.It is difficult to point out that the term 'quality of life' is used by whom but the term got some references at 9th World Congress of Sociology held at Uppsala in the year 1978 (Szalai,1980;p.7).Quality of Life covers wider aspects of one's life like family, physical health, psychological health, social wellbeing, work etc. Quality of life is the feeling of overall life satisfaction, as determined by the mentally alert individual whose life is being evaluated (Meeberg, 1993, p. 37). The individual's subjective psychological outlook in the presence or absence of physiological and functional burden determines the individual's perceived quality of life (Burckhart & Anderson, 2003; Murdaugh, 1997). Quality of Life refers to a subjective evaluation which is embedded in a cultural, social and environmental context.Purpose of the studyThe present study was designed to assess the spirituality and quality of life of adults.Objectives of the study* To assess the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups;* To determine whether level of spirituality affects Quality of Life.Hypotheses of the study* There exists no significant difference between the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups.* There will be no significant effect of level of spirituality on Quality of Life.MethodParticipantsThe participants of this study was consisted of 60 adults selected from Aligarh city.

      "abstract": "Soft Skills - The rudiments of speaking and listening in personal and group settings. To communicate, you need a transmitter, or better, a message, a receptor, and a context in which the communication process occurs. You also need a code to enable the receptor to \"read\" and understand the message. The ingredients listed above are true for each and every type of communication, including communication between machines. Take, for instance, a fire- alarm system. The transmitter is represented by an outside element (i.e., smoke and/or increase of heat) that behaves in a specific context, which is the air in a room. The receptor is the sensor that \"reads\" the signal through a predefined code and reacts by expelling water or another liquid to extinguish the fire. Between people, there is the advantage that the code is not given by an external entity but is sought by the two communicators while they establish a relationship.",

      "abstract": "People, as cognitive entities, do not have experience if there is not language that takes the role of mediates matchmaking and brings them experience.It also means that the use of language plays a decisive role in the human experience's meaning and in the decision in real life.Based on Wittgenstein's standpoint of the role of language, Rorty mentions that the symbols of life on transcendental matters such as religion or non-historical rational foundation -which are formed by the consciousness on the transcendent or the foundation -must be proved to be meaningless and categorized as matters of general political-cultural context, in other words, within the realm of the intersubjectivity in the community of language.He also agrees with Robert Brandom that there are no other principles if they do not belong to social standards.Social standards are the principles which are used in conversations and communications between people.The meanings, which have been made rather than found, are the meanings that given only in social discussions.When an individual describes the characteristics of an object, these characteristics are just provided by his consciousness on that object.Others cannot verify this private experience.However, that person can describe his feelings about that object to others by using the same language system in the same context.The individual experiences become the notion of the object when the intersubjectivity is established in conversation.That means the intersubjectivity creates the objectivity.Determining the existence of the self and the relationship between it and the external environment plays a vital role in shaping a thinking style of the relationship between individuals and communities, not only in the enactment of political policies but also in the interpretation of personal behavior psychologically.In this article, I will analyze one of the most controversial concepts in Richard Rorty's views on the self-creation, the inter-subjectivity.My article has two parts: firstly, the explanation of the self-awareness of an individual on others; secondly, the standards in perception are relative and the relativity in perceiving values can be seen as a new form of nihilism.",

As the material self cannot be disentangled from networks that are simultaneously economic, political, cultural, scientific, and substantial, what was once the ostensibly bounded human subject finds herself in a swirling landscape of uncertainty where practices and actions that were once not even remotely ethical or political matters suddenly become so. Trans-corporeality is a new materialist and posthumanist sense of the human as substantially and perpetually interconnected with the flows of substances and the agencies of environments. Activists, as well as everyday practitioners of environmental, environmental health, environmental justice, and climate change movements, work to reveal and reshape the flows of material agencies across regions, environments, animal bodies, and human bodies—even as global capitalism and the medical–industrial complex reassert a more convenient ideology of solidly bounded, individual consumers and benign, discrete products. Even though the recognition of trans-corporeality begins with human bodies in their environments, tracing substantial interchanges renders the human permeable, dissolving stable outlines. Tracing these connections discourages us from taking refuge in the fantasies of transcendence and imperviousness that make environmentalism a merely elective and external enterprise.",

Satisfaction with life implies a contentment with or acceptance of life circumstances. An individual who is satisfied with his or her life may also feel a fulfillment of needs for his or her life as a whole. In essence, satisfaction is a subjective assessment of the quality of one's experience. Because it is inherently an evaluation, judgments of satisfaction could be subjective and involve a large cognitive component. Subjective and relative aspects of satisfaction may not directly correspond to objective conditions. For example, poor people may report higher life satisfaction than rich people – people with more income may not feel more satisfied than people with less income.",

This could be shown e.g. in view of job-stressors and their consequences for cardio-vascular disease. As important the single risk factor may be, as limited is their impact when we look at the amount of explained variance, mostly only around 10%. On the other hand each examined population includes a larger amount of individuals who will not fall ill in spite of identical stressors as those getting sick. This ability to resist, based on special interior and exterior resources, is now called salutogenesis. It stands opposite to the term pathogenesis. More recent research in that area examines favourable exterior resources such as structures in \"social support\", favourable conditions at the work-place, in the family and so on. Other more personality oriented abilities include optimism, hardiness, etc. The founder of the theory on salutogenesis, Aaron Antonovsky, describes a concept of \"sense of coherence\" including (1.) comprehensibility, (2.) manageability, (3.) meaningfulness. More recent therapeutic concepts are based on these assumptions and have proved to be successful.",

      "title": "Thinking With and Without Words: A New Model of Cognition, Language and Mind",
      "abstract": "Thinking With and Without Words: A New Model of Cognition, Language and Mind Jack Lynch (jlynch2@comcast.net) 200 Lake View Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138 USA Viewing the mind as a sophisticated processor of analog signals rather than as a processor of symbolic information has led me to conclude that human intelligence emerged from nonhuman primate intelligence as a consequence, and only as a consequence, of the evolution of natural language. A nonhuman animal’s primary cognition processes endow it with a sophisticated means of extracting useful features of its environment from the signals from its sensors, such as the eyes and ears, that enable, some species, flexible survival-enhancing and even innovative behavior. The powerful primary cognitive system was greatly enhanced by the hominid and human species evolving natural syntactic speech—a two-tiered system of auditory communication. Meaningless sounds combine in restricted ways to produce words and words combine in restricted ways to form sentences. The secondary cognition system, also called the human reason system, not only allows the expression of internal representations of the primary cognitive system, it has created a new way of thinking that has resulted in a entirely new culture on the planet that has produced Shakespearian sonnets, jumbo jet aircraft, international corporations and a cure for infectious diseases. This new model of cognition is presented in two books, I am not a machine—Book I: Thinking without words (Lynch, 2004) and I am not a machine—Book II: Thinking with words (Lynch, expected late in 2004) and is introduced on the website, NOTaMACHINE.org. Under the proposed model of cognition, there is no inner language of thought (mentalese), no formal computational rules and procedures underlying thought and no inner “engine of reason” that controls or guides our behavior or utterances. This paper starts with a description of the primary cognition system upon which the new conceptualization of human intelligence rests. The first of four parts of the primary cognition model is a neural network pattern classification system (association). In addition, primates have a second-order pattern classification system (also called relational matching or tertiary cognition). This second-order process cannot be implemented by a feedforward neural network because the similarities to be noted are not in the patterns themselves but in the higher- order relationships in the patterns. The second part of the model is a mental representation system that can be best understood by introducing a new term, cogject that labels how minds from hamsters to primates mentally represent physical objects, actions and events. A critical property of cogjects is that they are singular and affirmative—a dog cannot represent, The cat is not on the mat. Unlike the popular inner language of thought hypothesis, these internal representations are not more precise than natural language—they are much less precise than natural language. This primary representation system has evolved the capability to chunk perceptions and representations in appropriately sized “bins,” so that a creature can gather statistical information of its world via neural network pattern classification processes. The third part of the model includes the well-documented specialized core knowledge systems. Also known as a cognitive toolkit, this system includes know-how about objects, navigation skills and a number sense. The fourth part of the primary cognition model is an action planning and evaluation system. An animal’s next immediate motor control movements are planned by sequencing representations of action control signals, that is, cogjects, in a buffer. Evaluation of a planned action is by an additional pattern classification process that operates on the cogject contents of the action buffer. The result of the evaluation process is either a go-ahead or an abort response that is simply based on pattern classification. If an action is aborted, another action can be planned and perhaps also aborted, leaving a human observer to conjecture that the momentarily inactive animal is “thinking.” Human cognition is modeled by three systems, the primary cognition system just outlined, a language cognition system, and a secondary cognition or human reason system. Language cognition includes those cognitive processes that support natural language. I endorse the cognitive linguists’ theory based on patterns and spaces rather than rules, procedures, symbols and formal systems. The third human cognitive system called, “human reason,” may be the least intuitive. Based on natural language, it establishes a new world of complexity by allowing us to create, name, describe, explain and communicate intricate concepts, procedures and theories. What can the human mind do with words? My answer is that we can tell stories, period. Human logic and truth are Greek myths that need comprehensive revision. Even the “truth” of science is a value we bestow on a story that has been corrected many times by many people who look for consistency with other stories (theoretical import) and consistency with their observations of the world (empirical import). Truth is based upon group consensus and is always subject to change and revision. Human intelligence is built upon animal intelligence and natural language and not on a separate engine of reason.

      "title": "Introduction: Emotion and Social Processes",
      "abstract": "Abstract To call this part in the Handbook of Affective Sciences “Emotion and Social Processes” is a bit misleading. The title implies that emotions as a phenomenon are distinct from social behavior but that the interested investigator can study the impact of affective processes on interpersonal interactions and vice versa. In fact, the emotions themselves are social processes. Emotions arise, in part, through interactions or anticipated interactions with others. They are part of the landscape of an organism’s social environment. As a scientist who asked why humans and other species express emotions in certain ways, Charles Darwin (1872/ 1998) can be seen as the first emotions theorist who offered a social explanation for the purpose of the affective system. His principle of serviceable habits articulated a view that emotional expressions reflect movements that were originally useful to our progenitors. These movements were often of a social nature—striking when angry, running away when fearful, mating when joyful, for example. Pairs of humans may bring their mouths together to kiss rather than share food, but in either case, associated emotions motivate distinctly social behaviors. Moreover, the signaling system that many scholars believe to be part of the function of emotions is social by definition. Darwin himself (1872/1998) only hinted at this communicative function for emotional expression, although other scholars following in his tradition have accorded it more importance. The idea is that, through facial expressions and bodily postures, humans and animals communicate to their conspecifics something important about impending social interactions. The baring of teeth in anger says, for instance, “See these fangs? If you continue to bother me, they could end up sunk into your flesh!” Although expressions may originate from physiological sensations and central nervous system (CNS) activity, that does not lessen their potentially important social function as communicative devices (see Ekman, 1998, for a fascinating personal account of the debate about expressions as reflecting internal changes in preparation for action, communication, or both). This essentially social nature of the emotional system is captured well by Ekman in his own influential theorizing about the functionality of emotion (e.g., the following passage from an imagined dialogue with anthropologist Gregory Bateson):",

      "title": "John Dewey on the art of communication",
      "abstract": "John Dewey once wrote: Of all affairs, is most wonderful. For him is highest of arts of life, for it is in that society is born and nurtured. It is by that we discover possibilities of nature. And it is through that we make our shared experience meaningful. It is no wonder, then, that Dewey would conclude The Public and Its Problems with this provocative statement: Democracy will have its consummation when free social inquiry is indissolubly wedded to of full and moving communication.Dewey, however, does not adequately explain what he understands by the of full and moving and never tells us how communication functions in varied contexts of practical life. Despite, then, his obvious affection for communication, he leaves many questions about it unanswered. For instance, what makes possible? In what kind of situations is called for and why? How does an inchoate feeling or idea find concrete embodiment in language? What are connections among language, communication, thought, feeling, and action? Most importantly, what is process by which one employs of to influence beliefs and behaviors of others? This dissertation addresses these questions by approaching Dewey's thinking on from a distinctly rhetorical perspective. Even though Dewey almost never mentions in his entire corpus, I argue that it is precisely absence of term from his writings that makes a rhetorical reading of his work all more imperative. Such a reading permits us to understand practical importance of art of in larger context of his social thought. If, then, problem with Dewey's writing on is that it often drifts into abstractions, one remedy is take those abstractions and place them into concrete situations, where is required to transform some part of environment through transaction with human thought and action. Because this kind of activity has been specific domain of rhetoric since time of sophists, it is only appropriate to read Dewey's work through that tradition.In effect, goal of this dissertation is to explicate Dewey's theory of in terms of a rhetorical theory. But insofar as his thought went through three distinct periods in his lifetime, beginning with his Idealistic period in 1880, moving into his Experimental period in 1903, and culminating in his Naturalistic period in 1925, Dewey can be said to have had three implicit rhetorical theories. To articulate and explain each of these theories, I trace Dewey's theoretical development through time and construct, through published works, private correspondence, and biographical material. I show that first theory envisioned rhetoric as a form of eros that helps us grow towards Absolute self consciousness. The second theory views rhetoric as a form of critical inquiry whose goal is development of phroncsis, or practical wisdom. The third theory treats rhetoric as a productive technc, or a naturalistic form of that has power to transform experience, nature, and society through its transactional character.By tracing Dewey's theoretical development and explicating three implicit theories of rhetoric in his writings, this dissertation not only provides a unique perspective on Dewey's changing views on language, ontology, and social practice, but also demonstrates how each theory can still be effectively used to interpret and guide of rhetoric. This kind of work enables us to grasp different facets of this diverse and vibrant art. At same time, it shows how Dewey's work remains an important resource for those who wish to promote and sustain a democratic way of life by educating citizens in of full and moving communication.",

      "title": "Plurally possessed: Gift and participation in the Theo-ontology of John Milbank",
      "abstract": "In this thesis an attempt is made to strengthen and develop John Milbank’s account of gift and participation, by way of encounters with other thinkers on gift (Jean-Luc Marion, Dietrich von Hildebrand), participation (James K.A. Smith, Thomas Aquinas), and transcendence (Catherine Keller, Mayra Rivera Rivera). The logic of the work is given in two moves made in the course of this dialogue, moves which concern grounds of possibility. First, it is argued that making sense of gift and participation requires a thought of the communicable or “plurally possessed”. In respect to (i) gift, it is proposed that unless something remains really the same in the giver, even as it comes to abide in the recipient, such that it is actively present in both—without such communicative “doubling” of a self-identical principle (“Gift”), there can be no transcendence from one person to another, and therefore no event of gift. In respect to (ii) participation, it is shown that Milbank thinks the creature’s methexis in divine being in terms of processio—the same divine life, originally proper to God, is also given to creatures in some way. Thus it seems that the intelligibility of (Milbank’s) participation also depends on the idea of plural possession—that the latter is to be thought as the condition for both gift and methexis.\r\nThe second move complements the first; here the possibility of plural possession is itself questioned. A distinction is made between two senses of “proper”, and thus between two ways of being a subject for something—metaphysically and dynamically/expressively. It is argued that the communicable is able to have plural expressive subjects, while remaining the Same (really one in its communicability) inasmuch as it has just one metaphysical subject. So in effect, the thesis suggests that taking account of this “propriological” distinction uniquely enables one to (a) provide the appropriate ontological basis for Milbank’s “asymmetrical reciprocity” in gift-exchange, (b) uncover the specific features of his ontology of participation, and thus (c) better evaluate Milbank’s thought.\r\nHowever, Milbank’s understanding of gift is still developing, and further research is needed on other aspects of his account of being and methexis. Also, more attention needs to be given to what the gratuity of gift might be, and how one might reconcile the (more Aristotelian) claim that creatures have created ontic forms, with the (more Platonic) claim that creatures have their being by bearing divine form as dynamical subjects.",

The components of communication are not just words, but non-verbal signs. The main goal of communication is mutual understanding, expression of psychic and emotional needs, and social intercourse.\r\n Various research shows the importance of just non-verbal communication. The fact is that the listener only remembers 10% of what he hears, 40% as it is said and 50% of the speaker's voice. The most common nonverbal communication is used to express emotions, encourage and alter verbal communication and give up personality. Non-verbal signs include facial expression, voice, touch, body position and gesture. In the business world, it is very important to know how to govern the rules of nonverbal communication. As a man is aware of his own body language and body language, the opportunity for better presentation of his own desires and better understanding of other people increases.",

And we blame ourselves both for things over which we exerted agential control (e.g., our voluntary acts) and for things over which we lacked such control (e.g., our desires, beliefs, and intentions). I argue that, despite this manifest diversity in our blaming practices, it's possible to provide a comprehensive account of blame.

Why do these ties remain so elusive? In the preceding pages, one reason has been offered up as an explanation. The adjective ‘social’ designates two entirely different phenomena: it’s at once a substance, a kind of stuff, and also a movement between non-social elements. In both cases, the social vanishes. When it is taken as a solid, it loses its ability to associate; when it’s taken as a fluid, the social again disappears because it flashes only briefly, just at the fleeting moment when new associations are sticking the collective together. Although it seemed at first sight that the subject matter of social sciences was easy to locate thanks to the massive and ubiquitous evidence of the social order, it now appears that it’s just the opposite: there is nothing more difficult to grasp than social ties.",

I argue that we may have different obligations to assist wild and domesticated animals because they have different morally-relevant relationships with us. I explain how different approaches to animal ethics, which, for simplicity, I call capacity-oriented and context-oriented, address questions about animal assistance differently. I then defend a broadly context-oriented approach, on which we have special obligations to assist animals that we have made vulnerable to or dependent on us. This means that we should normally help suffering domesticated animals, but that we lack general obligations to assist wild animals, since we are not responsible for their vulnerability. However, we may have special obligations to help wild animals where we have made them vulnerable to or dependent on us (by habitat destruction or by captivity, for instance). I consider some obvious difficulties with this context-oriented approach, and I conclude by looking more closely at the question whether we should intervene, if we could do so successfully, to reduce wild animal suffering by reducing predation.",

Archaic communication may be defined as the rudimentary remnants of animal signals originally used as warning signs for fellow creatures to flee or to hide, as means of mood conveyance or to transmit a state of alarm. Communication as a behavioral reply to an external event is the forerunner of our speech and verbal communication. This phylogenetic, older system of warning and communication still plays an important role in the symbolic function of organs and the way disease is used as a disguise or an appeal for help and pity. In regression and disease man's rudimentary alarm system becomes activated. Examples of such signs are given, such as fear melanosis, fainting, goose flesh, and several types of dermatoses. The comparative study of these rudimentary sign systems may open a new approach to the understanding of symptoms.",

Disability is not just about what people with impairments are prevented from doing and being, but about what they are required to do and be instead. Whether this involves taking on roles as passive recipients of others’ benevolence or involvement in demonstrations of the unimportance of impairment, either way negates the lived experience of impairment and signifies the desirability of normality. It is suggested that embracing rather than attempting to disassociate the impaired self from disability identity – recognising disability as oppression and absurdity and resolving to face this - enables this self to claim impairment as valid and ordinary human experience and to resist the invalidating requirements of the disabled role.",

The activity of reflection builds symbolic landmarks between which the metaphorical narrative myth about making and leading others can be organized. The conduct of men is not only organizational and methodological: it is spiritual. Self-knowledge that avoids recourse to defensive or aggressive mechanisms allows us to develop emotional accommodations, connecting practice and ethics without confusing them in “justastructure” (Seve 1966). We must all suspect ourselves and each other of hidden temptations disguised with legitimate reasons. Ethics is the unconditional authorization to become “someone else” in a space where knowledge, skill, initiative, and respect for shared values mean that freedom and limits must constantly be defined. But let no one be fooled: the best is confiscated by the discrete, efficient, and united castes who firmly hold the titles and means. Management serves them. Unconditionally.",

Essentially, our actions are somehow manipulated by what we see and what we touch. How does our space (peripersonal space) interfere with another’s? The idea of interaction within space (or social space) and space of selfhood thus becomes an essential subject for architecture and cannot be simply parameterized in a geometric manner. Physical space must, therefore, allow solitary or cooperative movement without alienating the individual. We base our judgments on movement, culture, personal psychical characteristics, memory, and personal experience.

Causal accounts also differ on the identification of the action itself. Some acounts say that the action is the bodily movement, provided that it was caused in the right way and had the right kind of effects. Others identify the action with the triggering intentional state (called a volition or trying), provided that it has the right kind of effects.

In this paper, I argue that animals are in some cases morally responsible. First, I outline conditions of moral action, drawing from a quality of will account of moral responsibility. Second, I review recent empirical research on the capacities needed for moral action in humans and show that animals also have such capacities. I conclude that though it may be difficult to engage in the practice of holding animals morally responsible, given the communication barrier and lack of mutual understanding, some animals nevertheless act in ways for which they are morally responsible.",

      "abstract": "Events are points in time that unconsciously (and sometimes consciously) we decide are important and that we remember. To better remember them, we usually associate them a name or a short description (e.g., my talk in Florence). Events, if not happening in the Web (but this case is out of our current interests), are spatially located (e.g., my talk is in Florence) and involve entities, e.g., persons, objects, animals, elements of the ambient (e.g., Fausto Giunchiglia, my slides). In turn these entities are \"connected\" by a graph of relations; some encode a spatial meaning (e.g., Fausto is near Benedetta), while others describe other information (e.g., Fausto is the father of Benedetta, Fausto is giving a talk). Finally these entities have certain properties which can be visual (e.g., Fausto wears a red T-shirt) or not (e.g., Fausto knows English, Fausto is late). Properties and relations are asserted using natural language words which can arguably be assumed to be understood by everybody and which, when making a statement, are arbitrarily selected inside our own vocabulary (of tens) of thousands of words.",

      "title": "Integrating twenty-five <i>Life APPs</i> ( <i>All Purpose Principles</i> ) inside the teaching of standard physiology courses",
      "abstract": "Physiology is perhaps the most integrated of the sciences involving as it does physics, chemistry, biology and various engineering principles. The purpose of this presented work is to (a) list and describe these 25 Life APPs, (b) show how they can be interspersed into standard physiology courses, and (c) to offer a currently used “Matching Quiz”, constructed within Brightspace (D2L), as an aid in students in learning these concepts. The 25 Life APPs include the “top ten”: Positive and Negative Feedback; Structure and Function relationships; Mortality vs Morbidity; Physiology as Applied Physics; Acute vs Chronic actions, Symptoms or Signs vs Causes; Human Body was better optimized for past environmental conditions; Effects of biological rhythms on general physiology; Primary Effect vs Side Effects; Why do most people think that the average female body is physically inferior to the average male body and why they are wrong. The remaining fifteen Life APPs are: Why some biological processes are simple and others complex; Why all sustained evolved structures have both advantages and disadvantages; Why various biological processes and organisms evolve; You, Free Will and Consciousness; How we know what is real or true vs false; Where the mind stops and the brain or body begins; Prevention over Correction; Redundancy aids in Safety; Difficulties of Borders and Interfaces; The ABCs of critical care; Defining death; Digestive consequences of having evolved in a different environment; GI track optimized for symbiotic bacteria; Why so many bad side effects when we take medicines to solve primary medical issues; Why these Life AAPs are worth remembering. These 25 Life APPs are integrated into he presentations within a 1 st year 2 nd semester course in A&amp;P, as well as the advanced undergraduate course in animal or medical physiology at the University of Maine. They can be adapted, in part or in whole, to any undergraduate or graduate physiology course. They are easily modifiable or selectively parsed. In addition to interspersing them, where appropriate, into standard systems physiology courses, I either assign them or grant extra credit for completing them within a Matching Quiz embedded within Brightspace (D2L). How this is currently done will be demonstrated during the presentation. The author is willing and prepared to share their Brightspace courses used for both IN CLASS and ONLINE teaching. In sum, 25 unifying (physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and all systems covered in physiology) concepts are described and coined as “Life APPs” (All Purpose Principles). These Life APPs have been integrated into standard lectures as well as in a stand-alone Brightspace Matching Quiz. These are made freely available to teachers of biology or physiology. There is no copyright on these Life APPS. There is no conflict of interest in the publication of this work. Private funding.

      "title": "Editor's Introduction: Symposium I: Words, Bodies, War",
      "abstract": "Editor's Introduction:Symposium I: Words, Bodies, War John J. Stuhr In April 2008, the American Philosophies Forum held a symposium called \"Words, Bodies, War\" at Vanderbilt University. Most of the twenty-four presentations, revised in light of significant discussion at the symposium, now are published in this and the subsequent two issues of this journal. For purposes of context, it is helpful to understand the more specific topics and questions addressed. They are as follows. Words, power, pluralism: Are words and languages, multiple and frequently contested, employed as weapons and powers to constitute (rather than merely represent) and legitimize some ways of seeing, speaking, and acting rather than others? If communication is a kind of sharing or having in common, do multiple voices point to multiple and different communities (rather than a single Great Community), and, if so, how is it possible for different voices to register, ensure, and even celebrate their differences without these differences being incommensurable, nonharmonious, or even warring? If one can \"do things\" with words, how and what should be done? Words, signs, experiences: What is the relation among words, signs, language, and experience? Is there no thought without signs? If words do not represent experience or the world, what do they do? Is there a dimension of experience or the world that cannot be captured by, or in, language? If so, does it follow that this dimension literally has no significance? What is the importance, if any, of attending, in thought and through language, to ways in which experiences outstrip that thought and language? Is this importance political as well as ontological? Is this importance always a kind of violence, of doing violence? Bodies, meanings, identities: What is the meaning of embodiment? Is there anything like a universal or shared or even partly shared meaning? Given different words, languages, and cultures, what is the relation of the meaning or meanings of embodiment to multiple embodied meanings and different specific lives? Further, what is the relation of embodiment to identity—or identities? Are embodied identities results or products of political powers? In turn, does embodiment have any political implications or consequences? If so, how and what? Are any of these implications democratic or pluralistic? [End Page 69] Bodies, identities, power: How are body and identity linked? Is body, or the meaning of specific bodies, at least in part culturally constructed? Is the same true for identity and specific identities? To what extent does the power of constructing body and identity rest with the self itself? Or to what extent does this power rest with or depend on others—others in general but also, even more, specific others who exercise this power, a power perhaps not shared equally? Is it important for a person to have some or much power over his or her own identity and the meaning of his or her body? Why? What are the political implications of this—generally or more specifically in terms of gender or race or class or ability or age or sexual orientation or nationality or other axes of identity? In particular, what are the implications for pluralism, for difference, and for democracy? Relativism, war, justice: We live in a world marked by wars, terrorism, and institutional and personal violence. In the face of these realities, what resources, if any, does democratic deliberation offer? Given that our preferences and ways of life differ, are values simply relative to these different preferences? Is a given person's view of justice simply one of these preferences? Is there a way to sort through or build from these differences? Do democratic ends require democratic means? Whether you agree or disagree, is democracy itself just one of so many different preferences? If there are reasons to be committed to democracy, what practices and actions should flow from that commitment today? War, manipulation of consent, democracy: If powerful economic, political, military, and other elites often can successfully (even if not totally) manipulate consent (and perhaps dissent too), what is the relation of consent (e.g., majority vote) to genuinely democratic ways of life? In contrast, is any notion of a nonmanipulated and, thus, \"free\" consent merely utopian and naive—the sort of thing...",

The concept of communication by itself starts from our existence as human beings, because if we sit back and analyse a little the idea of communication, we wouldn’t be able to interact with other people without it, in other words our existence on the earth would be useless. As I mentioned before, by any form of communication, verbal or non-verbal, we can share multiple emotions, feelings, desires, at the same time we can learn new things. Communication helps us, as human beings, evolve, develop our expertise in various areas, and it is&nbsp; an important factor when it comes to becoming successful and professional productivity. Leadership is the complex process through which a skilled person manages to convince more employees to accomplish certain goals, tasks or missions, with the common interest of developing the organization or firm.",

      "title": "Dialogical Self",
      "abstract": "Abstract In its original formulation, the dialogical self is conceived of as a dynamic multiplicity of I‐positions in the landscape of the mind. These I‐positions are involved in processes of mutual dialogical relationships that are intensely interwoven with external dialogical relationships. In this conception, the I is always bound to particular positions in time and space but has the possibility to move from one position to the other in accordance with changes in situation and time. The I fluctuates among different and even opposed positions and has the capacity to imaginatively endow each position with a voice, so that dialogical relations between positions can develop. The voices behave like interacting characters in a story, involved in a process of question and answer, agreement and disagreement. They all have a story to tell about their own experiences from their own perspective. As different voices, these characters exchange information about their respective Me's, creating a complex, narratively structured self. In this multiplicity of positions, some positions are more dominant than others, so that the voices of the less dominant positions are subdued (Hermans, 1996; Hermans, Kempen, &amp; Van Loon, 1992).",

But an organism that could also (i) identify, defend against, and attack its foes, and (ii) identify and support its friends, would seem to have an even greater advantage. To identify is to allow discrimination – friend or foe? – the former classification being non–dangerous (potentially unharmful), the latter classification being dangerous (potentially harmful). For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non–alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would lead to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe).",

To be sure, it now seems unsurprising for a postmodern philosopher in the 1980s to signal as casualties the principles of a reality beyond the play of appearances, the existence of unique individual subjects, claims for a truth or a metaphysics that persists. Dystopian rhetoric aside, Baudrillard's claim that simulation is built on a world of code has proven influential. It asserts that contemporary culture can be coded into ones and zeros, that \"digitality is among people. Obscenity is not confined to sexuality, because today there is a pornography of information and communication, a pornography of circuits and networks, and objects in their legibility.",

One answer would be to say that their 'characters' depend on the words they choose, their affective imagery and field of reference, their patterns of thought as presented in syntax, rhythm, metre, rhetorical structure. Thought-processes show the individual energies of mind and suggest a physical involvement in the moment by moment concerns of the drama. To know the characters they play, actors must be patient and search out the smallest cues and wait for inspiration or intuition, or happy accident, to give a sense that they are on, what is for them, the correct track. However, this answer still leaves a great deal unexplained.",

An affinity is noted between that theory and Berkeley's early doctrine of the self. Some rivals of the volitional theory invoke a spiritual or physical owner of mental items. They run a risk either of empty formality or of causal superstition. Other rivals postulate a non‐transitive and symmetrical relation in the set of mental items. They must allow in consequence either for joint ownership of one and the same mental item, or for incompatible simultaneous decisions by one and the same person, or for new forms of death. This makes them disquieting. Another rival invokes a transitive and symmetrical relation defined in terms of co‐consciousness. Even that allows for incongruous simultaneities. The volitional theory is free from such disadvantages.",

      "abstract": "Chapter 9, \"Connecting Difference: A Human/Guide Dog Assemblage\", examines how the relationships between humans and nonhuman animals can affect the experience and the notion of disability. The chapter is based on ethnographic observations of and interviews with a visually impaired woman called Eva and her guide dog Nessie, whose experiences are discussed within the framework of the Deleuzo-Guattarian theory of assemblage. In the traditional humanist paradigm, conceptualizations of nonhumanity and disability are built on assumptions of human superiority as well as on negative dialectics of identity, opposition, analogy, and resemblance. These conceptual constructs are challenged by the guide team/assemblage formed by Eva and Nessie, since an assemblage is always created through dynamic mutual processes, which have no beginning and no end, no leaders nor followers. In other words, the \"guide team\" is effective only when the humanist perspective, and its dichotomic view on the relationships between humans and nonhuman animals, is disrupted. Unlike dichotomies, assemblages only ever acquire temporary contours, which always allow other equally ephemeral connections or assemblages to emerge. Therefore, employing the notion of assemblage in conceptual thinking entails the subversion of the modern concept of borders as well as of such related concepts as body, autonomy, and independence. In this framework, subjectivity is not delimited by the distinction from others; instead, subjectivity is created in and through the relations and combinations with others, including animal and nonhuman others.",

In primates for example, social complexity is attributed to their intelligence and it is argued by many that the cognitive capacity of primates are especially manifest in the way they regulate their social relationships. Whereas the complex societies of non-human primates are considered to be as a direct result of their cognitive abilities this assumption is not made about social insects. In the absence of certain cognitive abilities their complex societies and structurally sophisticated nests are thought to arise from self-organisation. Since it is unlikely that cognitive capacities are all-or-nothing, usually integrating a range of mechanisms, it is possible that different species use similar cognitive mechanisms resulting in different behavioural outcomes.",

However, the loss of complexity may actually endanger one’s health. Aging is often associated with the pruning of work, family, and social networks in our external environment, and on a smaller scale, with the degradation of various anatomic structures and physiologic processes internally. This loss of complexity can impair our ability to perform activities of daily life or adapt to surgery or other stressors. We can quantify complexity using measures derived from the concept of fractals that describe patterns of behavior across different scales in space or time. Using these metrics we have shown that complexity loss is potentially reversible. This presentation will describe the measures, mechanisms, and consequences of complexity loss in different human systems, and interventions that can restore complexity and thereby improve functional health in older age.",

      "abstract": "Marine mammals and humans have the strongest manifestations of what is apparently a vertebrate-wide tendency toward a rightward action asymmetry associated with routine behavior. Marine mammal asymmetries usually involve whole-body actions associated with feeding. The human-like strength of these asymmetries may result from a problem of external aquatic support for the reactive component of the demanding lateral maneuvers of large marine mammals in daily pursuit of prey. Our asymmetrical primate heritage may also have begun with a rightward whole-body asymmetry, in prosimians, perhaps also resulting from problems of support for the reactive component of action; in this case arising from the arboreal habitat (and paradoxically including left-handedness). Monkeys and apes (simians) subsequently added right-sided adaptations for manipulation, bimanual coordination, bipedalism, throwing, and manual communication, most importantly by distal elaboration of limb function. The strength of human right-handedness may result partly from further elaboration of these simian action adaptations and partly from an evolving cognitive superstructure for tool use and language.",

      "abstract": "Noise is a sound which is unwanted, either because of its effect on humans, its effect on fatigue or multifunctions of physical equipment, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. It is a part of environmental pollution which can, in certain circumstances, reach worrying levels for the population (130 dB cause pain). Unsuitable exposure to noise for even short periods of time is responsible for symptomology involving the hearing organs (hypoacusis) and other parts of the body such as the cardiovascular, muscular and digestive systems via the connection between the central and the autonomous nervous systems. Noise in communal eating areas can be classed as coming from 3 sources: 1) operation of cooking machinery; 2) banging of pans and equipment; 3) voices of both staff and diners. The intensity of noise on these premises varies generally between 60 and 80 dB (discomfort threshold). The Regulations governing this subject are D.Lgs n.277 of 15/8/1991 regarding the protection of employees, D.P.C.M. of 1/3/1991 which establishes the maximum levels of noise both in the home and outside, and the more recent D.P.C.M. of 21/5/1999 referring to noise in public places, which includes restaurants. To contain the exposure to noise in public eating places, we believe that action should be taken at legal levels with stricter limits than the recently passed level of 105 dB, in the building planning departments and also with technological intervention in order to reduce the effects that noise has on the auditive and extra-auditive organs and thus limit possible sublimal messages which certainly do not benefit the psycho-physical well-being of the diners.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Work may be a mere source of livelihood, or the most significant part of one’s inner life; it may be experienced as expiation, or as exuberant expression of self; as bounden duty, or as the development of man’s universal nature. Neither love nor hatred of work is inherent in man, or inherent in any given line of work. For work has no intrinsic meaning. No adequate history of the meanings of work has been written. One can, however, trace the influences. of various philosophies of work, which have filtered down to modern workers and which deeply modify their work as well as their leisure. While the modern white-collar worker has no articulate philosophy of work, his feelings about it and his experiences of it influence his satisfactions and frustrations, the whole tone of his life. Whatever the effects of his work, known to him or not, they are the net result of the work as an activity, plus the meanings he brings to it, plus the views that others hold of it.",

      "title": "The electromagnetic basis of social interactions",
      "abstract": "It has been established that living things are sensitive to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields at vanishingly small intensities, on the order of tens of nT. We hypothesize, as a consequence of this sensitivity, that some fraction of an individual's central nervous system activity can be magnetically detected by nearby individuals. Even if we restrict the information content of such processes to merely simple magnetic cues that are unconsciously received by individuals undergoing close-knit continuing exposure to these cues, it is likely that they will tend to associate these cues with the transmitting individual, no less than would occur if such signals were visual or auditory. Furthermore, following what happens when one experiences prolonged exposure to visual and like sensory inputs, it can be anticipated that such association occurring magnetically will eventually also enable the receiving individual to bond to the transmitting individual. One can readily extrapolate from single individuals to groups, finding reasonable explanations for group behavior in a number of social situations, including those occurring in families, animal packs, gatherings as found in concerts, movie theaters and sports arenas, riots and selected predatory/prey situations. The argument developed here not only is consistent with the notion of a magnetic sense in humans, but also provides a new approach to electromagnetic hypersensitivity, suggesting that it may simply result from sensory overload.",

If we knew where avoiders go, we could study the pull of avoidance. This is a descriptive study ( N = 446) of interpersonal conflict. We found that physical and mental avoidance appeared with similar frequency, and that they could occur in combination. People often recognized their need for avoidance early, based on the topic being familiar or various signals of trouble. Avoidance during the conflict could be physical or mental, but notably involved false agreement or topic manipulation. The possibility of violence (physical, verbal, or emotional) was often relevant. Relationship worries frequently motivated the avoidance. After the avoidance rumination was common, often centering on what we called “festering anger.”",

Could there be consciousness without self-consciousness?Answer: Yes.We know this for a fact, because it can be empirically observed.Examples are numerous non-human animals, but also very young humans, severely mentally ill humans, and elderly humans with severe neurodegenerative disease.These can feel pain, fear, and fury to an intense degree, without having the capacity to reflect upon the self that is having these feelings.This does not lessen their suffering; it may even make it worse.2. Could there be self-consciousness without consciousness?Answer: No.This is a logical contradiction in terms.If I am conscious of my self, I am necessarily conscious of at least one thing -so I am conscious.Of course, you can have a self-referential loop that is not conscious -but ergo, in that scenario, they are also not self-*conscious*.And let's address some other assumptions in this text.A. The idea that the Turing test is a test of self-consciousness.It is not, nor was it ever intended to be.It is even becoming increasingly dubious whether the Turing text is a useful test of intelligence.A machine wins the Turing test if it manages to convince the human on the other side of the screen that they are talking to another human.But there",

      "abstract": "This document sketches a pluralist metaphysical system various inspired by the ideas of Bruno Latour, Paul Feyerabend, Graham Harman, J.J. Gibson and William James. The system can be summarized in eight propositions as follows: 1. Objects: Individual entities of many different scales are the ultimate stuff of the cosmos. 2. Abundance: These entities enter into relations with other entities but are never exhausted by any of their relations or even by their sum of all possible relations. 3. Realms of Being: In the large objects exist in patterns of relatively stable interactions among multiple objects. These are relations of indirect or vicarious causality. 4. Unity of Being: Humans desire the ability to access and reflect on memories of events in one’s life. The extent that that is achieved is called Unity of Being. 5. Life Way: A Latourian collective, with human and non-human members, is considered to participate in all the Realms in which any member of the collective plays a role. The ‘envelope’ of those Realms is called a Life Way. 6. Latourian Negotiation: Collectives having different Life Ways have been interacting through a process of negotiation in which differences among Life Ways are resolved and commonalities created or not depending on the desire to extend the boundaries of the larger more inclusive collective. 7. Realms of Abundance: Realms of Being are organized into Realms of Abundance, of which three have appeared to far: Matter, Life, and Culture. 8. The Fourth Arena: The current global Latourian negotiation brings us to the edge of a fourth Arena of Abundance. If it goes well, that’s where our successors will dwell.",

They evolve by a selection mechanism that is distinct from that of other traits. In order to become a reliable signal, a trait has to evolve handicaps that reduce its efficiency. Whenever information is received via signals rather than from direct observation, it is important to test its reliability. The handicap functions as a test of the reliability of the information encoded in the signal, including signals within the organism, to prevent mistakes as well as cheating. The properties of the test (the handicap) provide clues regarding the information included in the signal. Complex behaviors, such as altruism and suicidal tendencies, can be interpreted as handicaps. Unlike all other traits, signals lose their function when all can signal alike. Handicaps are essential components in the communication within social systems.",

A particular misapprehension concerning friendship and love also warrants some attention, however. Many people suppose that even if the egoist can be kind, charitable, or generous on certain occasions, his egoism undermines his capacity to enjoy deeper, more rewarding personal relationships. After all, isn't the egoist committed to always putting himself first? And as a consequence, won't he be too wrapped up in himself to care about others – or at least, to care in the way that a true friend would? Without a less calculated commitment to another person's well-being, the soul of love and friendship seems unavailable to him. Egoists cannot be authentic friends or lovers, the suspicion is, since, qua egoists, they can value others only instrumentally.",

And stress is not an anxiety disorder and it is not a normative concept.

      "abstract": "To reiterate: neither methodologically nor ontologically does an anthropology of ethics have its ground in the individual. The population of its interpretive universe is instead one of subjects in or passing through positions in environments. It is thus a population not of atomic units but of complex relata. Its subjects are for their part already highly complex. They may be individual human beings (though never human beings in their pure individuality). They may be the individualized subjects of the formally egalitarian society; Homines hierarchici, the holistic dividuals of the caste-structured social system (Daniel 1984; Dumont 1980, 1986); the relationalist subjects that Robbins and many others have encountered in Melanesia (Robbins 2004: 13). They may be human collectives, or even human and non-human collectives or assemblages of one or another kind. Nothing in principle precludes the possibility of a cyborgic ethics, an ethics of quasi-objects (Latour 1993), an ethics of corporations of an economic or of some other sort. The only proviso is that the subject occupying or passing through its position in an environment be at or beyond the threshold of the complexity requisite of any system capable of autopoiesis, though such a requirement is never the sufficient condition of an ethical subject position, even a potentially ethical one. Individual human beings typically display such complexity, yet do so only after a considerable course of socialization has taken place, only after a considerable dose of the intersubjective has already been incorporated, already become part of the self (and hence are never individuals in their pure individuality).",

      "abstract": "Abstract When dogs interact with humans, they often show appropriate reactions to human intentional action. But it is unclear from these everyday observations whether the dogs simply respond to the action outcomes or whether they are able to discriminate between different categories of actions. Are dogs able to distinguish intentional human actions from unintentional ones, even when the action outcomes are the same? We tested dogs’ ability to discriminate these action categories by adapting the so-called “Unwilling vs. Unable” paradigm. This paradigm compares subjects’ reactions to intentional and unintentional human behaviour. All dogs received three conditions: In the unwilling-condition, an experimenter intentionally withheld a reward from them. In the two unable-conditions, she unintentionally withheld the reward, either because she was clumsy or because she was physically prevented from giving the reward to the dog. Dogs clearly distinguished in their spontaneous behaviour between unwilling- and unable-conditions. This indicates that dogs indeed distinguish intentional actions from unintentional behaviour. We critically discuss our findings with regard to dogs’ understanding of human intentional action.",

Biology: The resemblance of one organism to another, or to an object in its surroundings for concealment and protection from predators. In evolutionary biology, mimicry is a similarity of one species to another, which protects one or both. This similarity can be in appearance, behaviour, sound, scent or location. Mimics are typically found in the same areas as their models. The pervasive condition of African architectural education and practice is one of mimicry, in which students and architects are (sub-consciously) driven to copy ‘solutions’ posed by practitioners outside the continent, most typically European or American, whose understanding and experience of Africa is often limited in nature. Wired, switched-on and connected, current and future young African architects are able, at the click of a finger, to peruse the ‘appearance, behaviour and [even] scent and sound’ of buildings and architectural projects that they may never experience ‘in the flesh’, but whose form, material and programmes are multiplying across the continent in ways and places that their original ‘makers’ could not possibly have imagined. Maboneng is now ‘the Manhattan of Africa’; Kigali its Singapore. Unlike biological mimics, in this context a ‘cut-and-paste’ approach neither protects nor conceals: it simply exposes. As far back as 1997, the Dutch architect and theorist, Rem Koolhaas, argued that it had become increasingly important for architects to operate on a level independent of architecture in order to understand, at the most basic level, the phenomena affecting the development of architecture and the city. In this article, rather than treat ‘cut-and-paste’ as pastiche, a quick-fix intervention that solves the ‘problem’ of original thinking, a new proposition for An Architectural Brief, for An (as yet) Unnamed African Architectural Student, in An (as yet) Unnamed African Location is proposed which fuses art, culture and digital technology to demand a radical, post-Afro urban example.",

      "abstract": "Primates are highly social and communicative mammals. They are by now known to possess a well‐developed sense of smell. Accordingly, it has become increasingly clear that olfactory communication may mediate many aspects of the social lives of primates. Olfactory signals differ substantially from visual or vocal gestures. They allow transmission of complex and sometimes more reliable information that is more persistent, but less direct, in time and space than other forms of communication. Chemical information can be transmitted passively or actively through deposition of scent‐gland secretions, urine, feces and other odoriferous material such as saliva. Olfactory communication has been documented in species of all major lineages and can fulfill various functions: mate choice; intrasexual competition; kin, individual, and species recognition; and territorial or resource defense.",

      "abstract": "Active and middle voice inflection within several classes of change of state and stative events can be explained in terms of the semantic notions affected subject and reduced energy. These notions are incorporated within a cognitive model of voice and transitivity that views both active and middle voice constructions as basic and non-derived. Active and middle voice are the manifestations of opposite poles of an energy continuum whereby active voice reflects greater energy and middle voice less energy. In highly intransitive events, such as pure states, a more abstract analogue of a physical energy continuum can be manifested as emphasis versus lack of emphasis or presence of volition versus absence of volition. Middle inflected passive constructions are functionally rehted to middle inflected changes of state because of the low degree of agency represented in both. The difference between passive and middle constructions is therefore graded rather than absolute, since both typically represent agentless events.",

      "abstract": "The term “collective action” is hopelessly broad. Taken at face value, it could plausibly refer to all forms of human behavior involving two or more people. Suffice it to say, consideration of such a broadly inclusive category would be well beyond the scope of this entry. But there is a far narrower subset of human action, to which the term has been applied and which will be the focus here. For our purposes, collective action will refer to emergent and at least minimally co‐ordinated action by two or more people that is motivated by a desire to change some aspect of social life or to resist changes proposed by others . By “emergent” I mean innovative lines of action that depart from taken‐for‐granted normative routines. “Co‐ordinated” simply means that the various parties to the emerging action are attuned to, and acting in awareness of, each other. Finally, the emphasis on change or resistance to change is intended to capture the adversarial or potentially contentious nature of “collective action.”",

Kant credited animals with \"lower\" mental/psychic phenomena like sentience, emotions, moods and perception, while denying the \"higher\" faculties of intellect and reason, including the capacity for genuine belief. Whether animals can draw theoretical and/or practical inferences is connected to the issue of animal rationality. A venerable tradition conceives of reason as a capacity to justify one's beliefs and actions, paradigmatically by deriving them from less-contentious assumptions. Animals face problems of discrimination, and some of them can solve these by distinguishing things according to their properties in a deliberate and considered manner. For the discriminations which underlie animal behavior need not coincide with people verbal classifications, either extensionally – by grouping together the same objects – or intensionally –by grouping objects according to the same properties. An intermediate position maintains that animals can possess some concepts, namely those that can be manifested in nonlinguistic behavior.",

      "abstract": "Biopolitics, ethics and desire all concern relations between things. Politics traditionally concerns relations between people. Biopolitics includes other species – animals, insects, plants – and it can be another name for ecology. Buildings are in ecologies. The processes that make buildings inescapably biopolitical include moving minerals and changing habitats. Ethics is the study of systems of values. People's values influence the kinds of interaction that are analyzed as politics. Ethics can involve questions of right and wrong, but in practice they more often involve which good course of action is to be preferred. Desire is a sense of lack, and in practice it always involves other people, who can help us to get what we want or put obstacles in our way. Buildings produce conditions that allow us to act on our desires. For example, without access to buildings, we have low social status and we often need privacy or protection to live the life we want. Buildings and the spaces between them modify social interactions by bringing people together or keeping them apart. Who is allowed in? Who is kept out? Who has the power to decide? Who has the power to be able to build?",

The conservative thought is that the parties will continue as participants in the current relationship; thus, in this respect, the future will resemble the past. The progressive thought is that in other respects, the future should not resemble the past: although the relationship will persist, the parties will change how they relate to one another in various ways, altering their lives and, to some degree, their very selves, not only to accommodate themselves to their partners but also to permit the relationship to pass through the expected stages.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, I assume that the study of the origin of language is strictly connected to the analysis of the traits that distinguish human language from animal communication. Usually, human language is said to be unique in the animal kingdom because it enables and/or requires intentionality or mindreading. By emphasizing the importance of mindreading, the social brain hypothesis has provided major insights within the origin of language debate. However, as studies on non-human primates have demonstrated that intentional forms of communication are already present in these species to a greater or lesser extent, I maintain that the social brain is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to explain the uniqueness of language. In this paper, I suggest that the distinctive feature of human communication resides in the ability to tell stories, and that the origin of language should be traced with respect to the capacity to produce discourses, rather than phrases or words. As narrative requires the ability to link events distant from one another in space and time, my proposal is that in order to explain the origin of language, we need to appeal to both the social brain and the ecological brain – that is, the cognitive devices which allow us to mentally travel in space and time.",

Each trait of the character of the individual should take into consideration his general external appearance and the nature of his abilities, decisions, motives, reactions, expertise, and the total values and attitudes that direct his behavior. The literary character is one of the imaginary or real individuals with whom the events of the novel or play deal. A number of values and traits are attributed to it, which can be discovered through the dialogue, the verbs and the description that the reader reads or hears. Like every human or non-human being that appeared in literature, whether individually or collectively, the character has a specific function in the story. Besides, it has physical, moral, and rational traits, which vary from one character to the other according to the function that is attributed to it, whether major or minor, and according to the literary genre in which it plays a certain role. In short, the character can be defined as the total traits that constitute the nature of the human being.",

      "abstract": "Frequently in one’s mental life, a newly-noticed item pairs with an item already in mind --- for example the second word in a rhyme --- and the pairing evokes a small positive affect. For the affect to occur, the brain must contain circuitry connecting the cognitive with the affective that is activated when the second item overlaps the first. On some occasions the positive affects evoked are easily noticed but more commonly they are subdued --- but they make up for smallness by abundance. For example, when one enters a familiar room, recognition events, (perception matching memory) are innumerable, the affects merge, and a continuous effect, the “comfort of the familiar” is sensed. Many other episodes of mild satisfaction are produced in a similar way. The overall picture is of one’s daily affairs running on a day-long substrate of innumerable pairings. The pairings make a healthy person more upbeat than an anhedonic person, they contribute to each person’s personality traits, and the pleasure involved is the basic ingredient underlying higher-level motivations. A general benefit will be gained if people become more aware of this pervasive affect.",

      "title": "CROSS-MODAL NEUROPLASTICITY : Auditory spatial recalibration following visuo-motor adaptation",
      "abstract": "“I think I heard a child screaming in this room full of smoke! Or, maybe, could it be a piece of metal that fell on the ground? No, I heard it again. I am sure now. It is a child and it comes from 20 meters ahead, slightly on the left. Call for backup I will enter first!”\nMapping the auditory space requires paying attention to several auditory cues as the ones illustrated in the example above: identity, location and direction of sounds. In the absence of visual information, it will be even more important to rely on these cues to be able to navigate properly. The visual input can be reduced following visual loss or decrease of conscious visual perception, a condition called unilateral spatial neglect; or in particular conditions such as in the example above, when firefighters have to rescue a child from a house full of smoke. When the visual input is reduced, the other sensory modalities will have to adjust their responses in order to maintain an adaptative behavior. The neuroplasticity induced by the modulation of a sensory modality on another sensory modality is referred as cross-modal plasticity.\nThis thesis is composed of two major parts and includes five studies. The first part, involving two studies, is dedicated to the investigation of the neural substrates of sound lateralization and auditory neglect in patients with brain lesions. The second part, involving three studies, is dedicated to the investigation of cross-modal plasticity and focuses on prism adaptation.\nTwo studies investigated auditory spatial deficits using an anatomo-clinical imaging approach on patients with a first unilateral stroke. Results showed that contralateral auditory extinction was associated with similar temporo-parieto-frontal regions on either hemisphere; that ipsilateral auditory extinction in patients with left hemispheric damage was associated with lesions involving intrahemispheric white matter connections; and that auditory sound segregation deficits linked to the inability to correctly use implicit spatial cues were predominantly induced by lesions including a large left temporo-parietal network. Three studies investigated the plasticity in sound localization induced by prism adaptation, a visuo-motor training used in the rehabilitation of neglect deficits. Two of them focused on the neural correlates modulated by prism adaptation during visual and auditory detection tasks. The last study investigated the effect of this adaptation on the alleviation of auditory spatial deficits occurring after a brain lesion. The results of these studies showed that the inferior parietal lobule is similarly modulated by the adaptation during a visual or auditory task, suggesting a supramodal role of this region. Moreover, the results of these studies allowed specifying for which patients this adaptation is efficient to alleviate auditory spatial deficits.\nOverall, these studies contributed to a better understanding of the nature of auditory spatial deficits in patients with brain damages. They showed the intrinsic ability of the healthy and damaged adult brain to adapt and improve. These findings illustrate how we can use the visual modality to help recover auditory spatial deficits. These results could potentially allow the development of new neurorehabilitation strategies.\n --\n“Je crois que j’ai entendu un cri d’enfant provenant de cette piece pleine de fumee! Ou bien etait-ce un objet en metal tombe sur le sol? Non, je l’ai entendu a nouveau. J’en suis sur maintenant. C’est un enfant et ca vient de 20 metres devant, legerement sur la gauche. Appelle du renfort, je rentre en premier. ”\nPour se representer l’espace auditif, il faut tenir compte de nombreux indices tels que ceux illustres dans l’exemple precedent : l’identite d’un son, sa localisation dans l’espace et son mouvement. En l’absence d’information visuelle, ces indices sont encore plus importants pour pouvoir s’orienter correctement. L’information visuelle peut se retrouver reduite pour plusieurs raisons : suite a une perte de la capacite visuelle, suite a une diminution de la conscience de l’espace visuel liee a un syndrome que l’on nomme heminegligence, ou dans des conditions particulieres comme celle de l’exemple cite au debut : lorsque des sapeurs-pompiers doivent sauver un enfant pris au piege dans une maison pleine de fumee. Lorsque l’information visuelle est reduite, les autres modalites sensorielles doivent s’ajuster afin que l’individu puisse conserver un comportement adaptatif. Cette neuroplasticite induite par la modulation d’un sens en reponse a un autre sens, s’appelle plasticite cross-modale.\nCette these s’articule autour de deux axes principaux et inclut cinq etudes. Le premier axe est dedie a l’etude des correlats anatomiques des deficits spatiaux auditifs et comporte deux etudes focalisees sur les deficits spatiaux auditifs de patients cerebroleses. Le deuxieme axe est dedie a l’etude de la plasticite cross-modale et comporte trois etudes focalisant sur l’adaptation prismatique.\nLes deux premieres recherches ont permis d’etudier les deficits spatiaux auditifs en utilisant une methode d’analyse permettant les correlations anatomo-cliniques. Les resultats ont demontre que l’extinction auditive contralaterale est provoquee par des lesions dans des regions temporo-fronto- parietales similaires de chaque hemisphere ; que l’extinction auditive ipsilaterale a la suite de lesions impliquant l’hemisphere gauche pouvait etre liee a des deconnections calleuses intra-hemispheriques ; et que les deficits de segregation lies a l’incapacite d’utiliser les indices spatiaux implicites etaient provoques principalement par des lesions situees au sein d’un large reseau temporo-parietal dans l’hemisphere gauche. Les trois etudes suivantes ont permis d’etudier la plasticite induite par l’adaptation prismatique, un protocole de rehabilitation utilise pour diminuer les deficits spatiaux des patients heminegligents. Ces etudes ont permis de confirmer le role supramodal du lobule parietal inferieur, qui est module de facon similaire par l’adaptation dans chacune des modalites sensorielles (vision, audition); et de preciser pour quels patients cette adaptation est utile pour diminuer les deficits spatiaux auditifs.\nEn resume, ces etudes ont contribue a une meilleure comprehension de la nature des deficits spatiaux auditifs que les patients peuvent presenter suite a une lesion cerebrale. Elles ont egalement permis de devoiler la capacite du cerveau adulte sain ou cerebrolese a s’adapter et ont aussi demontre que l’on peut utiliser la vision pour aider la rehabilitation des deficits spatiaux auditifs. Ces resultats pourraient potentiellement permettre le developpement de nouvelles strategies therapeutiques en neurorehabilitation.",

With behavioral relationships, object 'X' is either temporarily handed a reference to object 'Y' as an argument in a method call, or temporarily requests a handle on 'Y' from another object 'Z'. However, the emphasis is on temporary: when X is finished communicating with Y, object X often discards the reference to Y.KeywordsBase ClassClass HierarchyMethod SignatureStudent ClassRoot ClassThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "Children's Moral Relationships with Nature.",
      "abstract": "Two studies of the development of children's moral relationships with nature addressed such questions as: (1) What does it mean to say that we have an obligation not to harm the natural environment? (2) Does the natural environment feel pain? (3) Does it have rights? or (4) Is moral obligation an inappropriate construct by which to understand the poral relation of humans with nature? In one study, 60 children in grades 2, 5, and 8 were interviewed about the Prince William Sound Oil Spill. In a second study, 72 children in grades 1, 3, and 5 in an impoverished inner-city black community were interviewed on their conceptions of and values about nature. The preliminary findings from these studies provide evidence for several overarching ways in which children reason about the natural environment: (1) homocentric reasoning, in which an appeal is made to the child's understanding of how the action of one person or ;roup harms the physical welfare of others, or infringes on others' rights: the natural environment acts as an intermediary; (2) intrinsic values and rights reasoning, which highlights the idea that the natural environment has a moral standing at least partly independent of its value as a human commodity; (3) relational reasoning, which consists of framing the relationship with animals in a homocentric way such that animals serve human psychological needs; and (4) conceptions of harmony with nature that follow syllogistic reasoning. The findings build on children's obligatory and discretionary moral judgments and respond to two different questions on moral theory: What does morally right action consist of? and, What does it mean to be a morally good person?

      "title": "An Approach to Everyday Living: A Note regarding the Calculus",
      "abstract": "This essay reflects some of my current high order speculating-abstractings. I suggest readers apply visualization and imagination; rational, intellectual, and logical analysis alone will not help much. It would also help to remember that the world does not present itself to us as variables and functions. These represent labels we create for our own convenience - semantic tools to help us communicate with ourselves and others, and understand ourselves-in-our-world. When we forget this, and confuse words with what they represent, instead of communication we get misunderstandings; and instead of understanding we get confusion. According to Korzybski: As the organism works as-a-whole, for its optimum working, and, therefore, for sanity, we need a language, a method, which may be translated into a s.r. [semantic reaction] by which to translate the dynamic into the static, and vice versa; and such a language, such a method is produced and supplied by mathematicians. (Science and Sanity, fourth edition, p.288) Could features of the calculus, differentiation of a function, and antidifferentiation, have anything to do with translation from dynamic to static and vice versa? I believe so. (What follows represents my generalizations of the method of the calculus.) Using as an example: Speed as movement (dynamic) is translated to the static when we differentiate and get the representation ds/dt. (Speed (static label) a function, some sort of a ratio, relating change of position, and change of time - in other words, distance traveled in time taken.) This represents one way our limited nervous systems manage changes and relationships, too fast, too complex, too enormous, for us to map directly. We scale things down to more manageable proportions. If I am running (dynamic), I have an experience I can relate to the term speed. The term speed could be considered a crude macro-mapping and verbal representation, an abstraction of the activity I call running. So we have muscles and feet, and hands, and breathing, and heart pumping blood etc., as lower order abstraction-differentiation, to running (higher order abstraction-integration), to speed, (still higher order). The ratio ds/dt represents a more precise mapping (micro-mapping) and a mathematical translation, a differentiation, a representation, a method, which can be applied generally to many different situations involving movement. So we have gone from lower order to higher order and back to lower order. And ds/dt (the formula) can be considered a higher order abstraction embodying lower order abstractions (change in position divided by change in time). Here is another example. Let's take the term consciousness. Again we have a dynamic situation which many of us can recognize as related to that term. The term represents a macro-mapping, static verbal representation of an ongoing organismal process (continuous function). The activity called (human) can be considered as a system that both differentiates and antidifferentiates. (Antidifferentiation can be considered as the reverse of differentiation.) To put it in very simple terms, our consciousness scales things down and then does creative reassemblings. And let's now take whatever is going on in and around us, as another dynamic situation, to which we give the static label WIGO. We listen, look, select, analyze, objectify (create objects from sense impressions), make distinctions, label, describe objects, make inferences, explain, etc. We could view this as differentiating-consciousness. And we also classify, search for meanings, look for patterns, generalize, understand, explain, have beliefs, create scientific laws, mathematical formulas, come to conclusions, have feelings about things, and so on. We could view this as antidifferentiation - a what's-behind-the-scene kind of a thing. It is important to remind ourselves that depending on our level of abstracting, many of these activities can be classified as both differentiation and antidifferentiation. …",

      "abstract": "Many of humans' most important social interactions rely on trust, including most notably among strangers. But little is known about the evolutionary roots of human trust. We presented chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with a modified version of the human trust game--trust in reciprocity--in which subjects could opt either to obtain a small but safe reward on their own or else to send a larger reward to a partner and trust her to reciprocate a part of the reward that she could not access herself. In a series of three studies, we found strong evidence that in interacting with a conspecific, chimpanzees show spontaneous trust in a novel context; flexibly adjust their level of trust to the trustworthiness of their partner and develop patterns of trusting reciprocity over time. At least in some contexts then, trust in reciprocity is not unique to humans, but rather has its evolutionary roots in the social interactions of humans' closest primate relatives.",

      "title": "Behavior and behavioral needs",
      "abstract": "An understanding of behavior is important in any consideration of poultry welfare. Behavior is a good indicator of states of suffering such as fear, frustration, and pain. It might also be possible to use social interactions as indicators of welfare. The possibility of using \"luxury\" behavior, such as play and exploratory behavior, as an indicator of positive emotional states, requires investigation. Important welfare consequences arise from the fact that some behavior may be so strongly motivated as to constitute a \"need\". A behavioral need will arise in the case of behavior, such as nesting, that is controlled largely by internal factors, because these factors will be present no matter what type of environment is provided. Behavior triggered largely by external stimuli, such as responses to predators, will not give rise to a need if the external factors can be removed from the environment. Dustbathing is an example of behavior controlled by complex interactions between internal and external factors; the extent to which this constitutes a need is still being debated. If a behavioral need arises, then it is important that the environment provided allows it to be performed without damage to the performer or other birds. It should also be remembered that birds may need to perform behavior, including appetitive as well as consummatory elements, although the functional consequences of these are no longer required for survival. Finally, the performance of certain behavior leads to an increase in health or physical condition that improves welfare later in life.",

      "title": "The compassionate decision-maker",
      "abstract": "At times we respond to the predicament of another person with compassion. We come to an understanding of their difficulties and feel for them and suffer with them. Feelings of compassion call for an 'imaginative dwelling' on the particular circumstances of another. We will not have this experience or it will be misdirected if we do not treat the other person as an identifiable individual; someone with a particular history; someone with particular needs and desires. Compassion, in short, calls for particularity. The administration of the law, in contrast, calls for abstraction, it encourages an approach which treats people in general terms. Law's emphasis is on generality and the sameness of people; for justice demands that rights and obligations be applied equally, often irrespective of particular circumstances. That judges settle disputes according to law (and not moral principles or feelings) and that bureaucrats administer without affection or illwill are regulative ideals of our legal and administrative structures.",

Motions incorporate development of the hands, confront, or different parts of the body. Signals vary from physical non-verbal correspondence that does not convey particular messages, for example, simply expressive presentations, proxemics, or showcases of joint consideration. Motions enable people to convey an assortment of emotions and musings, from disdain and antagonistic vibe to endorsement and fondness, regularly together with non-verbal communication notwithstanding words when they talk. Motion handling happens in territories of the cerebrum, for example, Broca's and Wernicke's regions, which are utilized by discourse and gesture based communication. Actually, dialect is thought to have advanced from manual motions. The hypothesis that dialect advanced from manual signals, named Gestural Theory.",

      "title": "Possible objects count: Perceived numerosity is altered by representations of possibility",
      "abstract": "Our minds can represent not only how the world is, but also how the world could be. For example, when completing a jigsaw puzzle, we can appreciate not only the shapes of individual puzzle pieces, but also their potential to form a new object with a shape of its own: the complete puzzle that the pieces could make. What is the nature of this experience? Might such “possible” objects be treated like actual objects by mechanisms of attention and visual cognition? Here, we show that this is the case, by demonstrating a surprising connection between possibility and perceived numerosity. Subjects saw brief displays of “puzzle piece” shapes, and were simply asked how many shapes were in each display (in particular, which of two displays had more). Crucially, the shapes appeared in pairs that either could or could not efficiently combine into new objects. For example, pieces with triangular protrusions appeared near pieces with triangular indents (such that they could combine into a single piece); or, pieces with triangular protrusions appeared near pieces with rectangular indents (such that they could not combine into a single piece). Remarkably, displays with combinable pieces were perceived as less numerous than displays with non-combinable pieces—as if the mind treated two geometrically compatible pieces as being the single object they could create. Follow-up experiments replicated this result in a larger sample, ruled out confounding geometric factors, and explored how configural processing produces these effects. For example, pairs of combinable pieces were also seen as less numerous when oriented inward (with compatible protrusions and indents facing each other) than when oriented outward (with compatible protrusions and indents facing away). We suggest that the mind confers objecthood not only on actual objects, but also on possible objects—and in ways that alter downstream visual processing.",

      "title": "Consciousness Travels in Waves — The Conwave Model",
      "abstract": "There are three common approaches to resolving Chalmers' hard problem of consciousness in the academic literature, especially within scientific circles: Consciousness as an emergent property of complex or complicated neuronal computation in the brain; consciousness viewed as spiritual trait or quality of the Universe, which is distinct from purely physical actions; and consciousness composed of discrete 'proto-conscious' events occurring in a manner which obey physical laws of nature that are not yet understood fully. However, for one reason or the other, all three positions are problematic and are not able to address the hard and binding problems of consciousness. The Conwave Model, part of the author's larger The TEMIC Framework of Reality (TemFrame), resolves the hard and binding problematic issues in these positions by positing that consciousness is a fundamental, intrinsic, and primordial property of the Universe that transmits information (self-awareness, awareness of the surroundings, experience) and energy traveling in waves called conwaves (consciousness waves) from the absolute vacuum to any matter serving as a host to consciousness. Nervous systems (such as brains in animals) in relatively highly evolved organisms such as animals, information processing and/or signal transmission system in plants, micro-organisms, and other organisms are aspects or organs of consciousness in these living organisms (complex systems). Importantly, the Emergent Model of Inner-Outer Universe Cosmogeny (TEMIC) in TemFrame proposes that Big Bangs can also be regarded as expansions or explosions of fundamental consciousness in the absolute vacuum giving rise to individual consciousnesses in stars, planets, organisms, and others in the Universe, and fundamental consciousness, being one of the key forces of nature, is driving the accelerated expansions of the Universe.",

      "abstract": "Everyone has five senses: touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. Each of these plays a vital role in one's life. But what happens when you don't have one of these and are forced to live with it? Hearing loss is a condition that affects one of these five senses: hearing. Those affected by this condition lose their hearing. It may be a partial loss or complete loss but they cannot hear as one normally should. This condition is quickly growing to be common around the globe affecting a wide variety of people. What makes these conditions so unique is that there is a multitude of causes for them. This paper focuses on some of these causes to find a connection. It was found that one connection between all of these causes is that they are a result of some sort of physical damage or injury to the ear. But this injury’s location and specifications are different in each case yet the result is also hearing loss. Furthermore, this paper offers solutions and prevention for some of the different cases of hearing loss that can be encountered; thereby preparing persons to avoid this condition.",

      "abstract": "1 It is evident, that there is a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in their appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse, this is so observable, that any particular thought, which breaks in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas, is immediately remarked and rejected. And even in our wildest and most wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a connexion upheld among the different ideas, which succeeded each other. Were the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed, there would immediately be observed something which connected it in all its transitions. Or where this is wanting, the person, who broke the thread of discourse, might still inform you, that there had secretly revolved in his mind a succession of thought, which had gradually led him from the subject of conversation. Among different languages, even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other: A certain proof that the simple ideas, comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.",

      "title": "Experiments on Remembering: (<i>c</i>) The Method of Picture Writing",
      "abstract": "When I was planning this investigation, in the early part of 1914, a question which was uppermost in my mind was the way in which conventional modes of representation and behaviour are developed within the social group and transmitted from group to group. Such conventionalisations are produced by a combination of innumerable small changes introduced by a large number of individuals; and it is not fantastic to suppose that there may be a parallel between them and the development, in the course of individual recall, of relatively fixed and stereotyped modes of representation or of reaction. There is no doubt that much human remembering is influenced directly and strongly by factors which are social in origin. The influence of these factors may be obscured by the ordinary laboratory methods of the study of memory, because of the exceedingly artificial character of the material which is used. But it seemed possible that suitably devised experiments could help to show how, by the accretion of many small changes, the individual human subject achieves reactions and modes of representation which are for him genuinely conventional. Perhaps, also, some light might be thrown upon the ways in which such changes, as they are passed about from person to person in a community, gradually come to develop conventionalisations which become current within a given social group. The way would thus be prepared for a more precise study of how the established conventions of one group fare, when they are introduced to another group possessing different conventions.",

(is there…?) question or anitas or 'there is' sense. Regarding the relations among these three senses of being I show that: (i) the same logical treatment holds for the form (B) and (A2), since both can and need to be re-written in the form: something is so-and-so (whereas the same process cannot be applied to the A1 sense of being); (ii) the relation between the A1 and A2 senses of being is not a mere relation between distinct elements, but rather a relation among different stages of a single process, namely that between first and second actuality; (iii) the relation between the A (1 and 2) and B senses of being seems to be one of grounding, since the 'there is' sense seems to Aquinas to be grounded on the present actuality sense of being as an effect to its cause.",

      "abstract": "David Hume, like Locke, is very sceptical about the nature of substance, whether material or immaterial. And he goes much further than Locke's agnosticism, saying that both sorts of substance are inconceivable. He thinks we cannot get beyond our impressions (roughly, our sensations) to know anything whatever about their causes. For all we know, our impressions could be caused by any of the following: material objects (whether similar to our impressions or wholly unlike them); God (as Berkeley might say); our own minds (either dreaming or hallucinating), that is, nothing at all external; an arch deceiver; any other as-yet-un-imagined cause. But knowledge of these causes is in principle impossible for us: like Berkeley, Hume holds that we only ever know or have experience of mental items. We thus have no standing to hypothesize, let alone any grounds for inferring, the existence of anything that is, as Hume says, “specifically different” (of a different species or kind) from impressions and ideas: the two sorts of mental items that are the only ones he recognizes and which he refers to in general as “perceptions” (T I.ii. vi, 67–8).",

      "abstract": "As he observed on a number of occasions, human embodiment is central to Goffman's understanding of 'the interaction order'. To interact, actors must exist for one another, which they do, in the first instance, by means of perception – a process which presupposes both the sense-perceptible properties which embodiment gives to the actor and the sensuous, perceiving nature of the body. Our embodiment allows us to communicate. However, it may also cause us to 'say too much', giving more away with respect to ourselves than we might wish. The necessitates that we exercise a vigilance with respect to our bodies and a control over them, both key aspects of the 'impression management' for which Goffman is well known, and indeed for maintaining 'face' – a corporeal metonym, which is perhaps more than a metonym, involving as it does the ability of actors to look one another 'in the eye' without (embodied) gestures of deference or (embodied) feelings of embarrassment. Moreover, embodied co-presence is a source of vulnerability too, because embodied we are susceptible to injury and attack, generating a further risk which has to be managed. In this chapter I discuss these and other bodily themes in Goffman's work, drawing out their significance both for an understanding of Goffman and for the wider sociology of the body.",

Yet, habits exonerate me from reflecting each time about the proper way to act under given circumstances. Thus, acting on the basis of habit means to act unreflectively and involuntarily. The ‘habitual self’ is opposed to the ‘reflecting self’. Habit actually is the power of forgetting. It is not unconscious in a psychodynamic sense; rather it is a form of unreflecting, inattentive, practical Cogito. As such, it is another form of dissociated spontaneity, next to drive and emotion, which may surprise me, especially when it prescribes me a given action that is inappropriate to the circumstances. Habit is what lets me discover alterity as repetition in the course of my intersubjective life.",

      "abstract": "We are living in a fractious world, where personal relations between the people are not always pleasant. There could be many insignificant, trivial conflicts between individuals, which if they were not resolved at some point, they may grow and may become serious problem not only for personal relations but for community. It is commonly thought greetings, smiling, shaking hands, embracing and kissing one another is the primary cure, or primary precaution for such social problems however, for hearts to truly reconcile and strengthen social bonds, those behaviors are needed but not enough. If such gestures do not spring from a deep-seated conviction that one's fellow being must be loved for the sake of God, then they remain at the level of external social politesse and cannot effect social reform at the deepest, grass-roots level. As Nursi said primary motive of individuals must come from the belief. 'Love for the sake of God, dislike for the sake of God, judgment for the sake of God must be guiding principles for onces life.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of utopia (a good place) and dystopia (a bad place) might be arrived at and developed by one’s contact with the (constructed) reality and comprehension, yet frustration and discontent with it, and one’s pessimism and optimism over a better present and future contingent upon the place and time in which one exists. The former has a long history, whereas the latter is a work in progress. That is, one cannot simply distinguish between the two by asking whether the latter is primarily precautionary and reactive, cautioning us what not to do, whilst the former is proactive, pointing us towards the right direction. Both the former and latter may have similar motives, namely, to demonstrate the dark characteristics of one society by comparing it with another, fictitious culture. Someone’s utopia might alternate dystopia, or many traditional utopias from the past include aspects that modern readers would identify as dystopian. On the other hand, one could argue that dystopia serves as the worst-case scenario, presenting a degraded, collapsing, and/or collapsed society, be it socio-culturally, economically, or technologically, worse than another, yet still hopeful for a drastic change for the better. Utopia could be received as the best-case scenario for people in a society considering its socio-political demise. Shortly, both utopian and dystopian scenarios would fit into an extended framework of contemplations on a catastrophe that would either signal a tremendous shift for the better or result in an apocalyptic nightmare. Drawing on the standpoints of Giles Deleuze and Jean Baudrillard and tracing Don DeLillo’s fiction, this paper seeks to explore the notion of dystopia, the future assumptions that dystopian fiction puts forward, and the challenges and issues it highlights, such as digital surveillance, technological control, the disappearance of individualism, uncertainty, and dread.",

Whitson provides a helpful introduction to the Saussurean and Peircean traditions of formal semiotics. Every act of semiosis, every occurrence of semiosis, every semiotic practice in a community is necessarily also a material process in some physical, perhaps also biological, perhaps also social and human system. Ecosocial systems, and most living organisms, are developmental systems, they have a relevant history, a trajectory of development in which each stage sets up conditions without which the next stage could not occur.",

      "title": "Our Addiction to Attributive Adjectives",
      "abstract": "We humans differ radically from other animals because we use sophisticated symbolic languages in thinking and speaking. We use our languages represent persons and things and facilitate the creation of thoughts. We misuse our language when we misrepresent persons and things and create life-degrading thoughts. In the following pages, I'll examine one way in which believe we misuse language. Two sentences in Science and Sanity (page 384) outline this misuse: we use a language of adjectives and subject-predicate forms pertaining sense impressions, we are using a language which deals with entities inside our skin [italics Korzybski's] and characteristics entirely non-existent in the outside world. Thus the events outside our skin are neither cold nor warm, green nor red, sweet nor bitter, but these characteristics are manufactured by our nervous system inside our skins, as responses only different manifestations, physico-chemical processes. Many papers exist dealing with subject-predicate forms, notably the use of predicate adjectives following copulative verbs, e.g., water is warm. have seen none dealing with the use of adjectives as described in Korzybski's statement, especially the adjective, e.g., I prefer warm If the term attributive is new you, let me quote from the definition given in the Random House unabridged dictionary: Pertaining an adjective ... that is directly adjacent to, in English, the noun it modifies. The same reference work also gives this definition of attribute: to consider as a quality of or characteristic of the person, thing, group, etc. of the thing indicated. Briefly, an adjective stands next the word it modifies, and by its position it implies attribution of its quality or characteristic that word. Here's an illustrative experiment from life that may make this clearer. Fill three pitchers with water. In #1, the water has a temperature reading of 35 degrees. In #2, 65 degrees. In #3, 95 degrees. A person puts his hand into pitcher #1 for a few minutes. Then he puts the same hand in #2. He'll say, That's warm Another person puts her hand in pitcher #3 for a few minutes. Then she puts it in #2. She'll likely say, That's cool They use adjectives attribute different temperatures the same water. Obviously false. The two people are describing what they have manufactured in their own nervous systems. (1) The habit of using adjectives make false-to-fact attributions of what we feel and think, energy manifestations, physico-chemical processes, has become an addiction for most of us. Indeed, we are even less aware of making this attribution than we are when we use the is of identity. Concentrating on the is of identity language form addresses only part of the fundamental identity problem. Even total elimination of this is from our vocabulary will leave us basically in the same semantic trap. Korzybski described his awareness of the addictive power of the language structure of false attribution by saying he had keep a model of his Structural Differential before him on his desk. …",

      "title": "Letting Tourette's be?",
      "abstract": "Tourette Syndrome is almost exclusively seen through the lens of disruptive tics. The most relevant clinical question seems to be: how to combat tics? In line with emerging calls from those diagnosed, we argue for a more positive approach focused on the Tourettic person, rather than on disruptions flowing from tics. This change of focus is ethically motivated but has important theoretical implications. As an exercise in ‘letting be’ (i.e. of finding out what something is on its own terms, through sensitively interacting with it), it brings out the basic relationalities of Tourette’s with both the non-human and the social environment. Echoing Tourettic lived experience, disruptive tics then emerge as the tips of icebergs consisting of spontaneous, even playful, interactions with the environment. A more nuanced view emerges in which problems experienced by those diagnosed are no longer located in individual brains but require comprehensive study of how tics situationally develop. Listening attentively to lived experience reports leads to a dramatic shift away from the classical ‘lack of inhibition’ model, to reveal a constant pressure to inhibit actions that one feels strongly and spontaneously compelled to do. This inhibition is dependent on what is signaled as disruptive by others and is therefore suppressed for their sake. The Tourettic person’s distress or felt impairment seems more tied to an onlooker’s focus on their tics, than on the severity and frequency of their tics. We conclude that ‘letting be’ is an attitude towards Tourette’s that is worth considering, both clinically and theoretically. In fact, we believe that the overall good prognosis as to felt impairment correlates with finding trusted environments where one is ‘let be’ (without being ‘let go of’) instead of living under constant scrutiny.",

      "abstract": "Evolutionary studies account for cooperation under the shadow of the future. But how can altruism spread without direct reciprocity? Learning from punishment, including badmouth, is impossible in harsh environments, where agents do not survive rejections received. Imitation is indispensable, but what to imitate? Frequent behaviors are not necessarily socially desirable, neither fitness observable. In this paper, agents meeting infrequent but lethal food scarcity survive thanks to food sharing. Saving recipients from certain death, donations reduce altruists' lifetime. Results show that prudent donors, helping only when above starvation point, are exploited by cheaters and soon extinguish. The same happens with agents taking reciprocity into account, and helping only when their credits are turned off. Instead, agents endowed with dynamic goals (survival vs. giving help) learn even the most unconditioned form of altruism, thus avoiding extinction. Tentative conclusions are discussed. Among others, dynamic goal-directed agents are autonomous entities learning even the most generous forms of altruism. Moreover, prudence is not necessarily more adaptive than unconditioned altruism; indeed, it may be self-defeating under given conditions.Request access from your librarian to read this chapter's full text.",

      "abstract": "Extract The main text of The Ethical Demand begins as it ends, with a reference to Jesus's proclamation of the love commandment: to love your neighbour as yourself. This injunction has great resonance in ethics, as does the parable of the Good Samaritan to which it is related, in a universal way, not just to those with religious faith, or those who are aware of its biblical context. But can we make sense of it outside that context? And even if we can, what exactly does it ask of us? What is it to love the neighbour, what does such love call for in our response to them? Is this love something that falls on us as an obligation, or is it beyond the call of duty? How can love be a matter of obligation at all? If you help the neighbour, can you demand something in return? And if you cannot, how can giving such love to others ever be rational? Should we show love to them by giving them what they want, or instead what they need? How far is our love to others supposed to extend—who is the 'neighbour', and might they include 'the enemy'? What kind of love is involved here, and how does it relate to love in other forms? And what makes it the case that this love is required of us—does it arise from God's command, or some sort of practical inconsistency given we all need help ourselves, or from the neighbour's right to be loved—or simply from the fact they are vulnerable and in need? But can the needs of others be sufficient on their own to generate requirements on us of this sort?",

      "title": "The Impact of Animals on Secondary Trauma",
      "abstract": "The presence of animals can be beneficial in managing secondary trauma. Animals can serve to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression and encourage exercise and playfulness while providing unconditional love and affection. Humans have kept pets for the purpose of stress reduction throughout history. Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a puppy cradled in the hands of a human from as early as 10,000 BCE. Pets have been associated with health benefits including lowering of blood pressure, and in general pet owners have lower levels of cardiac disease, heart failure, strokes, and other circulatory problems. The human-animal connection enhances one's ability to form and trust relationships. When secondary trauma produces feelings of isolation and an urge to withdraw, contact with animals can diminish the feeling of being alone and can facilitate an inclination to seek social contact with others. Animals have been used in healthcare facilities for many years and have been found to facilitate both physical and psychological healing. Numerous well-controlled empirical studies have shown the value of service animals for both civilians and veterans. The presence of animals enhances trust in the environment; increases one's ability to experience and give love, compassion, and affection; and generally reduces negative affective states. Most of the studies on the beneficial effects of the presence of animals have relied upon self-report measures. However, studies do exist showing lower pre-post levels of cortisol following engagement with animals. A case study is presented of a VA physician who experienced extensive secondary trauma owing to the suffering she witnessed among those with serious COVID infections. This physician had tried various forms of intervention including social support groups but was most helped by the presence of her pets.",

As such, little data exists to assess the relationship between the cognitive sophistication of octopuses and their social capacities (i.e., the social brain theory). We found that laboratory-housed Octopus bimaculoides were more active, and more of their activity occurred in proximity to a neighboring tank when housed in social situations similar to their natural habitation (i.e., continuous presence of a neighboring octopus with ample resources), compared to when housed alone. In addition, we found that these effects further varied based on the identity of the neighboring octopus, even when accounting for familiarity and weight differences. These findings suggest that octopus sociality may be more flexible than previously believed, and that their social capacities may include individual recognition and/or dyad-specific relationship dynamics. Future work should investigate to what extent flexible sociality is part of their rich behavioral repertoires.",

      "abstract": "We may learn more about what it means to be present in a mediated or virtual environment through our attempts at measuring it as through experimentation and philosophical reflection. This requires however that we take a more fundamental stance to measurement. Taking the definition of presence as the perceptual illusion of non-mediation as our starting point, the possibility of different levels of presence — states in between being present fully in either the real or the virtual environment — will be discussed based on an embodied framework. In this framework different intermediate states of presence are based on the extent to which the automatic body schema procedures have fallen for the illusion of non-mediation; are treating the simulated content as if it were real. Measuring presence then involves considering the whole of the organism when observing its response to the virtual content: not only people’s self-reported experiences and volatile behaviors, but automatic behaviors and environmentally induced visceral responses as well. Correlational approaches to combine these observations into a presence measure will not only be unsuccessful, they are also misdirected. Instead, we must search for a set of responses that are transitively ordered in a manner that is the same for all individuals. The discovery of such an invariant and transitive order will be similar to establishing the fixed points on the temperature scale. The promise is the objective assessment of presence, and an understanding of what it means to be present without having to revert to operationalism or latent variable theorists’ doctrines.",

We can even find out how much they want something by seeing if they will ‘work’ to get what they want when it is made more difficult for them to obtain it.

      "abstract": "Greed is the unrelenting and unrealistic search for all the good an object has to offer and, via identification, all the good one can produce and provide. In phantasy, and sometimes in the patient's early developmental environment, the object and the ego demand more from each other than either have to give. Some patients cannot contain their urge to possess all and to be all, so it becomes a part of the interpersonal and psychological relationship with the analyst rather quickly. These patients feel something is owed to them, and they demand to be fed immediately. Other patients try and hide these greedy phantasies by being the opposite of greedy. They strive to be independent and charitable, while having great conflict over deeper desires to be dependent and in possession of an idealized giving object, an all-providing breast. Case material was used to explore these ideas.",

      "abstract": "Under established and known demands for their time, individuals are in general temporal equilibrium. When exogeneous shocks alter those temporal demands, objective and subjective temporal misfit ensues, and individual functioning suffers. We propose a theory that describes the process of temporal resilience—as in, resilience about time, not over time. The theory starts with disruptions of temporal equilibrium and ends with individual functioning trajectories as temporal resilience outcomes. We argue that while the displacement of temporal disruptions (i.e., the dissimilarity in temporal demands pre- and post-disruption) has a negative effect on individual functioning, their duration (i.e., the length of occurrence of the disruption) has a reverse J-shaped one. Then, using displacement and duration, we develop a typology of disruptions as time wrinkling, ripping, reshaping, and razing. Next, we propose that individuals can react to those temporal disruptions via three temporal resilience responses: adjusting, absorbing, or adopting. These three responses differentially and respectively allow the individual to return to either objective, subjective, or both forms of temporal fit. Further, depending on the type of disruption, each temporal resilience response sets the individual onto particular trajectories toward the previous temporal equilibrium or to a new, more optimal one.",

In naturally living species, conflicts arise over the control of resources – principally food, shelter and mates; in most instances a social interaction decides the outcome of a contest, with ritualised displays taking the place of direct physical confrontation. Most contests will be decided quickly, with the ‘loser’ displaying a submissive posture or gesture, and quickly retreating with little harm done.

      "title": "Understanding death as the cessation of intentional action: A cross-cultural developmental study - eScholarship",
      "abstract": "Understanding death as the cessation of intentional action: A cross-cultural developmental study H. Clark Barrett (barrett@mpib-berlin.mpg.de) Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition Max Planck Institute for Human Development Lentzeallee 94, Berlin, Germany Introduction Taken together, the developmental literatures on chil- dren’s understanding of intentional action and on chil- dren’s understanding of death present a sort of paradox: while the former literature shows that even very young children have an intuitive grasp of the goal-directed na- ture of behavior that characterizes animate, living things, the latter seems to show that children do not realize un- til a much later age that the capacity to act intention- ally ceases irreversibly when an organism dies. From an adaptationist perspective, this is perhaps surprising, given the potential adaptive value of being able to judge the capacity or incapacity of an animal to act, and per- haps to do harm. In many states which are characterized merely by a lack of motion – sleep, for example – an an- imal may still wake up and attack. When dead, however, it cannot. It may thus be adaptive for young children to understand that death, as opposed to sleep and other states of temporary inaction, entails the permanent ces- sation of the capacity for intentional action. And, given that an intuitive grasp of the capacity for intentional ac- tion in animate living things exists at a very young age, it should be available to serve as a conceptual substrate for an early understanding of death. Study design The present study was designed to probe for an under- standing of death as the cessation of the capacity for in- tentional action by comparing judgments of 3 to 5 year old children about hypothetical dead and sleeping ani- mals (human and nonhuman). Children were first asked questions about an awake animal, then about the same animal either asleep or dead. The target questions re- quired children to judge whether the sleeping or dead animal would be capable of movement in general or in response to being touched, awareness of an external stim- ulus (someone moving nearby), and / or of having an emotion. The intentional action theory of death under- standing predicts that children will exhibit the clearest understanding of death in response to questions involv- ing movement and movement in response to stimulus, as opposed to questions that do not involve intentional action (e.g., awareness only). There was no predicted lower bound on the age of emergence of reasoning abili- ties probed here. The study was conducted in two parts, both using the same interview procedures and questions. The first part of the study was conducted with 70 preschool and kinder- garten children, age 3 to 5 years, in Berlin, Germany. The second part of the study was conducted with 70 Shuar children, age 3 to 5 years, in six small rural villages in the Amazon region of Ecuador. Because these pop- ulations vary widely both in exposure to various kinds of cultural and environmental input (e.g., television and films, direct contact with animals, personal experience with death), they were selected for comparison to deter- mine whether the development of the kind of understand- ing of death probed here depends significantly on cultural inputs such as television, and / or aspects of personal ex- perience such as contact with animals or firsthand expe- rience with death. Parents in both populations were sur- veyed about relevant experiences of their children which might have influenced understanding of death, such as re- ligious background, exposure to representations of death on television, and personal experience with death of ani- mals or people. Results Both Shuar and German children demonstrated an un- derstanding of death as the cessation of the capacity for intentional action by the age of 4. By this age, the large majority of children clearly distinguish sleep from death in this regard. In addition, many of these children un- derstand that the capacity for subjective experience inde- pendent of action ceases in death as well, though perfor- mance on these questions, as predicted, was not as high at this early age as performance on questions involving intentional action. The results of the study show that by age 4, children understand at least one aspect of death which is crucially important from an adaptive perspective: dead things can no longer act. Although this result stands in contrast to much of the developmental literature on death under- standing, which suggest that children’s understanding of death at this age is poor, it is consistent with a view of cognitive development which holds that development has been shaped by a history of selection for adaptive reason- ing and decision making abilities.",

On the other, the misanthrope will be portrayed as guided by unbending principle, their reasoned disdain deriving from a high-minded moral code, like Moliere’s Alceste. The videogame Plague Inc., which casts players as a pathogen with the objective of annihilating the human species, offers an alternative misanthropy, however.

      "title": "A Bioanthropological Overview of Addiction",
      "abstract": "A BIOANTHROPOLOGICAL OVERVIEW OF ADDICTION DORIS F. JONAS* and A. DAVIDJONASi Sometimes a collaboration between individuals occupied in separate biological fields and the application of understandings from one field to the other leads to felicitous insights and new perspectives. Our own experience has encompassed studies ofthe evolutionary bases ofhuman behavior on the one hand and two decades of clinical experience with addicts of various kinds (and their families) on the other. Departing from the conventional view that addiction arises solely from the life history of an individual or out of an obscure chemical imbalance, we have come to a formulation of the problem, rather, as one of the effects of group mechanisms upon the individual. The dynamics residing within the entity we call a society affects all its members. There are those who can adapt themselves to group requirements and others who in some or many ways cannot. This applies to all social groups of all creatures, whether animal or human. Very frequently manifestations that appear to us to be peculiarly human, when compared with the patterns oflife ofother animals, come to be thought of as due to our cultural endowment or to our specific civilization and as phenomena that therefore define a separation between our species and all others. Language, love, politics, and the care of the sick are among many human propensities and predilections that come into this category. Yet everything human has its origin in an animal past, and such a view tends to prevent certain aspects of human behavior from being seen in a context of overall natural patterns, hindering full understanding of their significance. The problem of addiction is certainly a human one, and it has not been thought ofin terms of comparative behavior. The reason is simple. Addiction does not occur in a natural state. Laboratory animals may be induced artificially to become addicted to most of the substances on which a human being may become physiologically or psychologically dependent, but this does not happen in feral conditions. Nor, on the other hand, is the presence of \"mind\" in man an explanation for the»Fellow, Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain. tCivilian psychiatric consultant, U.S. Army Hospital, Würzburg. Address: APO 09801, New York, New York. Perspectives in Biology and Medicine · Spring 1977 \\ 345 different behavior, since animals with no advanced neocortical development can become addicted in laboratory conditions. Beyond the failure to view addiction in terms of overall natural processes—or perhaps a part of that failure—is the tendency we have had to ask questions about the \"whys\" of addiction in terms only of an addicted individual's life. We ask what personal problems led him to turn to drugs or alcohol for relief. Even if we take a step further and examine the social background of the addict, seeking a cause for his problems on a wider basis, this larger dimension is considered relevant only in terms of its effect on the individual; and so the answers we find, like the questions we pose, remain individual oriented. Since the study of the individual is the domain of the psychiatrist, the problems of addiction have come to be accepted as within his province. A further question that must arise, ofcourse, is how it can happen that addiction can arise biologically. This question has been asked by some, and answers to it have been sought in the physiology of the nervous system. But this step again focuses on the individual, even when investigations are pursued into his genetic background; and so, while the question is right, the approach to answering it is limiting, since it leads no further than the previous ones—to the individual. Yet it is indeed in neurophysiology that we may begin to find clues to the larger pattern. The nervous system is more than a recipient of stimuli and regulator of an organism's behavior. It is a repository of reflex responses that connect the individual to his phylogenetic past and is also a regulator of interactions between the individual and the present society of which he is a part. What we call social pressures are conveyed to an individual, and he reacts to them, not only through...",

      "abstract": "Recent studies on the minds of other species are associated with a variety of issues, including: social communication, language and numerical skills, production and use of tools, theory of mind, mental time travel, and consciousness. This text presents the current trends in research in the last three aspects of the functions of the mind – each of which is acquired by a human being in the early ontogeny, while there is a definite relationship between them.\r\n«Theory of mind» is a term for a specific cognitive ability. An individual has a theory of mind when it attributes mental states to itself and to others. Certainly, the lapse in time travel in animals is significantly narrower compared to man. However, it seems that animals have and use some form of personal memory of the past, namely, episodic-like memory.\r\nThey also have abilities of anticipation and a planned behavior limited in time based on prospective memory. Finally, consciousness – a condition or ability to be conscious or aware of something but in its most complex form – is recognized by the person through their own actions and feelings, thus being aware of their own thoughts, insights, and other events taking place in their mind.\r\nBased on this kind of definition we can assume the existence of at least two kinds of consciousness. We can talk about perceptual awareness wherever there is a conscious perception, although the content of consciousness may be processing information to anticipate or recall past events. Animals with the ability of perceptual awareness not only react to stimuli, but intentionally select the appropriate response, based on the active processing of information.\r\nThe second type is the awareness of self-centered consciousness that allows one to think about thinking, emotions, and perception, referred to as introspective consciousness. It is this kind of awareness that allows you to have a mental representation of yourself and others that has a direct relationship, and for some is even an essential component of mental time travel and theory of mind. Currently, it is believed that many species of animals, including all mammals, birds and other creatures – among them octopuses – use this form of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Survival relies on an organism's intrinsic ability to instinctively react to stimuli such as food, water, and threats, ensuring the fundamental ability to feed, drink, and avoid danger even in the absence of prior experience. These natural, unconditioned stimuli can also facilitate associative learning, where pairing them consistently with neutral cues will elicit responses to these cues. Threat conditioning, a well-explored form of associative learning, commonly employs painful electric shocks, mimicking injury, as unconditioned stimuli. It remains elusive whether actual injury or pain is necessary for effective learning, or whether the threat of harm is sufficient. Approaching predators create looming shadows and sounds, triggering strong innate defensive responses like escape and freezing. This study investigates whether visual looming stimuli can induce learned freezing or learned escape responses to a conditioned stimulus in male rats. Surprisingly, pairing a neutral tone with a looming stimulus only weakly evokes learned defensive responses, in contrast to the strong responses observed when the looming stimulus is replaced by a shock. This dissociation sheds light on the boundaries for learned defensive responses thereby impacting our comprehension of learning processes and defensive strategies.",

Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (Study 1) and a conspecific (Study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster or spend more time in their proximity than when they had attended to something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is present in both humans and great apes and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected.",

This classification of senses depends on the fact that a human being has five kinds of sense organ - skin, tongue, nose, eyes, and ears. However, synesthesia in language indicates that we have additional senses. This study examines synesthetic metaphors in Japanese. Synesthetic metaphors are expressions in which the words or phrases proper to one sense describe the experiences of another sense. When we describe our experiences of one of the five senses, we can use three types of expressions. Words proper to that sense, explanatory expressions such as “nakitakunaru-yohna iro”（＝a color which makes me cry), and synesthetic metaphors (that is, words which originally relate to another sense). Some words like “hukai” (＝deep), “hageshii” (＝violent), or “sabishii” (＝lonely) describe the experiences of some of the five senses, like “hukai oto” (＝deep sound), “hageshii iro” (＝violent color), and “sabishii iro” (＝lonely color). But they do not originally relate to any of those senses, and are not explanatory either. These expressions are synesthetic metaphors and the adjectives must be words of some senses other than the five. The existence of these synesthetic metaphors proves that we have three more senses other than the five, at least in Japanese, - “dimension,” “movement,” and “mood.”",

It would seem that in so grouping these subjects, the eyes, the ears and the other senses have no longer been considered isolated phenomena but as parts of an integrated whole. It seems important at this early point in the discussion to emphasize the fact that the term \"vision\" is frequently misused, usually only connoting visual acuity. It should be emphasized that vision in its broadest sense includes visual acuity, the extent of the fields of vision, the normality or abnormality of binocular vision, and the adequacy of the visual associations such as recognition, identification and memory. It seems superfluous to point out that excellent visual acuity, if seen through a gun barrel, is by no means satisfying. Also, that a full, wide field of vision, when the object of interest is blurred, is most unsatisfactory. Having two eyes, each of which is a perfect unit, but not seeing together well and comfortably, is most annoying and handicapping. Finally, referring back to the brain a perfect visual image, which cannot be properly recognized and identified and then correlated with similar images previously received, is a totally frustrating experience. Thus, for a child \"to see well\" he must see clearly the thing he looks straight at, he must see widely the things about him, as well as the object of interest, he must have his two eyes properly co-ordinated, and he must be able to recognize, identify and associate this image with related images and activities of the past.",

The author offers evidence that when patients presenting for diagnosis and treatment of physical disease are appraised from both normative physicalist and psychotherapy perspectives, somatic metaphors are frequently observed. Building on clinical examples, the crucial role of the clinician in observing (or failing to observe) this conjunction of physical disease and personal meaning is analyzed; a visual modeling of clinician patterns of observation is provided to facilitate clinicians in moving away from simplistic, reductionistic, observer patterns so that they may accommodate physical and \"story\" perspectives in the same clinical space; biomedical and biopsychosocial models are analyzed, demonstrating that neither can explain somatic metaphors and that an alternative theory is therefore needed; and a unitary model of personhood and disease is proposed that avoids mind-body dichotomies and dualistic assumptions and lays a groundwork for the exploration of physical and subjective aspects of patient reality as playing active roles in the development and perpetuation of, and recovery from, any physical disease.",

      "title": "Learning controllers for human-robot interaction",
      "abstract": "In order for robots to assist and interact with humans, they must be socially intelligent. Social intelligence is the ability to communicate and understand meaning through social interaction. Artificial intelligence can be broadly described, as an effort to describe and simulate the property of human intelligence inside of a computational model. In most cases, this simulation happens in a vacuum. An agent, such as a robot, maintains a computational model which includes all information required to make decisions. This internal computational representation is what we consider its intellect. Information may enter this model through perception, and be expressed in the form of action. This separation of knowing and doing can be quite effective for representing certain types of intelligence. However it does not lend itself to simulating social cognition. \r\nIn order to communicate socially, an agent must be able to affect change in the mental representation of other agents, as well as the physical world. However, social interaction and the creation of meaning is inherently different than interactions with the physical world. Because there are no mathematical models which describe how actions and perceptions affect the mental representations of a human, we cannot hope to build an interactive agent by directly simulating this process. For this reason, when building artificial social intelligence, we need to pay attention to prevailing theories on how humans learn. Many popular theories from cognitive science, social psychology and language development suggest that action and perception are not subordinate to mental representations. Instead, mental representations are a result of action and perception that results from an agent's interaction with an environment and other agents. In particular, social learning theory says that the process which allows agents to understand one another happens from the ground up, starting with action and perception, and resulting in the shared mental representations, and understanding of how to affect change in the representations of others. \r\nThis thesis addresses the problem of building social intelligence into robotic systems using computational learning and adaptive control. We focus on the problem of how to use decision theoretic planning for learning to interact with humans from the bottom up. We first examine the use of affect recognition in designing human-friendly control strategies. Next, we address the problem of defining subjective measures of interactivity by leveraging human expertise. Finally, we define and evaluate a method for participating in the process of socially situated cognition. We emphasize learning to predict and modulate observable responses of the human rather than attempting to directly infer their mental or emotional states. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated experimentally using custom robotic systems.",

      "title": "“Self-Realisation Leads to the God Realisation”",
      "abstract": "Every person’s life is like Kurukshetra; their good qualities are like friends, and their bad qualities are like enemies. Life itself is like a battlefield where we have to make the right decisions to achieve our goals. Seldom does the mind become confused regarding right and wrong, and it wanders; in the meanwhile, we make the wrong decision. As a result, there is a struggle between good and dreadful, false and truth, and true and evil. The term “Dharmakshetra” refers to this. When one is surrounded by unfavourable gesture impressions of the outside world or one’s own physical possessions, the mind is triggered to defend the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. When the mind is surrounded with detrimental gesture impressions of the environment or one’s own belongings, it triggers a lot to sustain the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. Our current field, whether it be tangible or incorporates different facets of life, including the job, family, business, or the social, political, economic, and moral domains in which we are pursuing our vocations, is becoming more and more like “Kurukshetra.” We all need the knowledge that Krishna imparted to Arjuna on the battlefield upon the soul and its features as well as God and his attributes, just as Arjuna required Lord Krishna’s advice in the Gita. Therefore, in order to maintain a peaceful, enjoyable existence free from hardships and ill luck, it is essential to do yoga and to be aware of both God and thyself. We compare the many viewpoints of the Gita via that of Brahma Kumari, who has deep ideas and whose opinions are very identical, in an effort to make the readers feel more secure and conscious of both God and oneself.Similar to this, there are several parallels between the soul, the absolute soul, and yoga, including the Bhagavad-Gita’s philosophical lines and spiritual content. According to the Indian poet and mystic Kabir of the 15th century believed that “(Kudh) ko jano tho khuda ko janenge,”1meaning that “Aatma anubhuti sey Eashwar anubhuti.”Brahmakumaris 2godly version says that “The self is the ultimate reality, and realising it is the key to liberation,” according to the B-Gita. “Tat tvam Asi” 3(you are that) can be seen in the Chandogya Upanishad. Self-realization is the sole path to nirvana, according to Adi Shankaracharya’s4. non-dualism doctrine from the eighth century, “Aham Brahmasmi Advaita Vedanta,” that he laid out in his work Atma Bhoda.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the most challenging points of the controversy on the status of the social, which \nTarde and Durkheim sustained one century ago, concerns the place that each gives in their \nsociologies to the notions of difference and identity – and, by extension, to the notion of \nrelationship. Whereas, for Durkheim, we begin life in a simple state of sameness and we \ngrow into increasingly complex states of otherness, for Tarde we begin as we finish, as we \nlive, that is, different, since “difference keeps differencing” (“la difference va differant”; \nTarde 1999a: 69), since difference is something that has the unique capacity to take itself \nas a target or as an object of change. This point is crucial, directly affecting the ways each \nthinker has chosen to define society and to practice sociology, the former arguing that \nthe social is a special – that is to say, transcendent – domain, the latter that the social is \nimmanent to relations of association. As Tarde claims, “those final elements at which all \nsciences arrive, the social individual, the living cell, the chemical atom, were final only to \nthe eyes of their particular science; even themselves are composites” (Tarde 1999a: 36). \nAgainst those who take for granted the identity of the collective or the composition of the \nsocial – as Durkheim did for example in his Suicide – Tarde argues that we must follow the \nassociations, the movements of composition themselves.",

      "title": "Acquaintance, Abstracting, Non-Allness",
      "abstract": "Getting Acquainted with the Territory What an individual experiences depends upon which specialized structures in his nervous system are stimulated. Note the paper on which this is written. In what ways can an observer have relationships with it? He can see it, touch it, smell it, taste it, lift it, tear it, etc. Each sort of response provides one avenue of acquaintance, because the receptors (the eyes, nostrils, skin, etc.) are so differentiated that each is sensitive only to particular stimuli. wave lengths of radiations which affect the rods and cones in the retina of the eye do not also affect the nerve endings, membranes, and canals in the ear. Each nervous receptor will thus be excited by some stimuli from the paper. And since none is all-engaging, it follows that our acquaintance with the paper through any one nervous means will be specific and partial. Second, variations in sensitivity in the specialized nervous receptors in different observers will make for differences in the reports of their experiences. Deafness, color blindness, near- and far-sightedness, fatigue, adaptation, reaction time, etc., influence both the kind and the quantity of impressions, thus making acquaintance with anything personal and individual. Third, the character of an individual's habits and interests affects the working of the nervous mechanisms so that his responses to stimuli are individualized. Objects viewed by several persons may thus give rise to widely varying evaluations. How different the reactions of a hungry baby, a dairyman, a bacteriologist to a bottle of milk. 'Milk,' Barry-more looked horrified. 'I tried the stuff once,' he said shuddering, 'but the stuff turned to chamois in my stomach!' The fool sees not the same tree that a wise sees, said William Blake. Fourth, what is experienced varies with the position of the observer. Where you are determines what you see. It makes a difference whether your seat at the opera is in the orchestra or in the top gallery on the side; whether you study New York City from the tower of the Empire State Building or the lush surroundings of an exclusive night club; whether you are in a bomb shelter or near a radio getting the news summary of an air raid. In the foreground of a famous Holbein painting one can see an oblong yellow patch, but from one particular position the patch looks like the top of a skull. notion of perspective thus further emphasizes the partial character of experience. William James in Will To Believe said, There is no possible point of view from which the world can appear as an absolutely single fact. And when different observers are located in different places, it should not be surprising if they get different impressions and so make different maps. Fifth, the fact that human reactions occur in makes impossible our acquaintance with any object from all sides at once. At best, human study can proceed only serially, i.e., viewing the various aspects in turn. Details must be missed as observation goes on. A blade of grass as well as a three-ring circus defies coverage at any instant. But even if there were time to use the full resources of the nervous system, our acquaintance would still be partial, for microscopes and atom-smashing chambers would reveal new details. And special investigators, chemists, physicists, technicians, etc., could extend the areas of observation indefinitely, so that the process of becoming acquainted with anything must ever remain incomplete. In the words of George Santayana, most exhaustive account which human science can ever give of anything does not cover all that is true about it. All the external relations and affinities of anything are truths relevant to it; but they radiate in space and time to infinity, or at least to the unknown limits of the world... before we could know all about [the flower in the crannied wall] we should have to explore for ourselves the whole universe in which it grows. …",

      "title": "A Study on Economic Models of Animal Communication Methods",
      "abstract": "Economic models of animal communication are theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain the evolution and function of communication signals in animals from an economic perspective. These models typically assume that animals have limited resources, and that communication is a way for them to allocate these resources effectively and efficiently. One of the most well-known economic models of animal communication is the handicap principle, which was first proposed by Amotz Zahavi in 1975. The handicap principle suggests that some animals have evolved to produce costly signals, such as elaborate courtship displays or loud vocalizations, as a way of demonstrating their genetic quality to potential mates or rivals. The theory is that only animals with high genetic quality can afford to produce such costly signals without harming their overall fitness, and therefore these signals serve as honest indicators of genetic quality. Another economic model of animal communication is the game theory model, which was developed by John Maynard Smith and Richard Dawkins in the 1970s. The game theory model assumes that communication signals are used by animals to signal their intentions or strategies in competitive situations, such as fights over resources or mate choice. The model predicts that communication signals will be honest and reliable when both the sender and receiver have a shared interest in the outcome of the interaction, but may be deceptive or unreliable when there is a conflict of interest between the two parties. Other economic models of animal communication include the public information model, which suggests that animals use communication signals to gather information about their environment and the behaviour of other animals, and the sensory drive model, which proposes that animals use communication signals to attract mates or communicate with conspecifics in environments where there is strong selection for signal detection. Overall, economic models of animal communication provide a useful framework for understanding the evolution and function of communication signals in animals, and have led to a number of important insights into the dynamics of animal behaviour and social interactions. Animals use signs to communicate, such as visual, auditory, or sound-based cues; Pheromones, or tactile, tactile signals, are examples of chemicals. Animals that communicate with one another find partners, establish dominance, defend their territory, plan group behavior, and tend to their young. Several species rely on calls, non-vocal auditory bursts like a dolphin's tail grabbing in the water, bioluminescence, olfactory cues, chemical cues, tactile cues, visual clues, and postural movements as ways of communication. Animals’ communication is the exchange of information that influences the present or future behavior of the recipients between one or more animals (the recipient or recipients) and one or more animals (the sender or senders). Auditory, tactile, and visual communication are the three main modes of communication between people and animals. An early illustration of auditory communication is when a dog barks at its owner to show its happiness at receiving food. Animals' ability to communicate is an adaptation that aids in survival. Audio, visual, tactile, and chemical (taste and smell) forms of communication are all possible. Animals utilize communication to identify themselves, indicate territory, warn off predators, and attract mates.",

      "title": "The Ethological Command in Art",
      "abstract": "The ethological command in art is a review of certain aspects of form perception that may be influenced by biological evolution. The information from recent ethological studies, which examines the similarities between animal and human behavior, should interest the artist and augment his intuitive capacity to create aesthetic form.\n\t Many factors are involved in the evolutionary changes of most animal species. One factor that has guided the development of animal and human behavior is called selection pressure. An example of selection pressure is the need for social communication for sexual reproduction and group protection. Another category of selection pressure resides in the various dangerous animals and predators that impinge on the survival of particular animal groups. So intense is predator selection pressure that some animal species appear to have evolved unlearned recognition and avoidance of predators.\n\t The visual cues for both social signals and predator recognition are termed ‘releasers’ because they evoke a somewhat stereotyped reaction when viewed by certain animals. Man was certainly exposed to specific selection pressures during his long evolutionary history, and, as a result, he uses intricate social signals, such as facial expressions and body postures, for communicating emotional states during interpersonal contact. The spontaneous fear exhibited by man to snakes, scorpions and other insects with many legs suggests that these avoidance responses represent emotional by-products for survival purposes-residual from an earlier evolutionary period.\n\t If the artist desires to create an exciting piece of art, he might consider using various releasers and selected social signals to enhance the visual impact of his work. Some of the visual releasers that will be discussed comprise paired concentric circles, serrated contours and linear bands that exhibit high conspicuousness.\n\t The artist can attempt to control the viewer’s arousal by selecting visual releasers that will evoke the desired response.\n\t Dans le domaine de l’Art, l’orientation ethologique consiste a reconsiderer certains aspects de perception des formes qui peuvent etre influences par l’evolution biologique. De recentes comparaisons ethologiques sur l’evolution du comportement animal et humain devraient etre de nature a interesser l’artiste et a augmenter sa capacite intuitive au moment de creer une forme esthetique.\n\t De nombreux facteurs agissent sur l’evolution de la plupart des especes animales. Un premier element, ayant guide le developpement du comportement animal et humain, est la pression selective. Un exemple de pression selective est le besoin de communication sociale visant a la reproduction sexuelle et a la protection du groupe. Une autre categorie de pression selective est illustree par les betes feroces, qui reduisent le temps de survie de certaines especes animales. La pression selective de la bete feroce est si intense, que certaines especes animales ont un flair inne provoquant une reaction de defense vis-a-vis des betes feroces.\n\t Les indices visuels des gestes de communication sociale et de detection des betes feroces sont appeles signes stimulants car ils evoquent une sorte de reaction type chez\n\t les animaux se trouvant en contact avec ces betes feroces. L’homme fut certainement expose a des pressions selectives precises au cours de sa longue evolution, d’ou l’utilisation de gestes de communication compliques, tels qu’expressions faciales et attitudes corporelles evoquant les etats emotionnels dans les rapports humains. La peur spontanee ressentie par l’homme devant un serpent, un scorpion ou devant tout autre insecte multipattes montre que ces reactions de fuite sont des derives emotionnels de l’instinct de conservation, remontant a une epoque anterieure de son evolution.\n\t Si l’artiste desire creer une œuvre d’art extraordinaire, il devra tenir compte de divers signes stimulants et gestes de communication pour rehausser l’impact visuel de son œuvre. Certains signes stimulants visuels, parmi ceux dont il est question, comprennent des cercles concentriques jumeles, des contours denteles et des bandes lineaires aux formes tres marquees.\n\t L’artiste peut essayer de controler le degre d’excitation chez l’observateur en selectionnant des signes stimulants visuels qui evoqueront la reaction souhaitee.",

Through the narratives of their work, they show what is not always visible in archives. Their artworks confront us with unarchived and unarchivable dimensions (what is not archived and what cannot be archived), constituent of how archives are created. In studying the archives that are part of found-footage works through an archival usage framework (exploitation), three main cat- egories of the unarchived and the unarchivable emerge: absence, which is linked to gaps, fragments, and incompleteness; the forbidden, which manifests in archives as material traces; and the invisible, which is not shown. These three categories have to do with an unconceived ( impensé ) state – a state of the archival field reflecting the intentional or unintentional inconceivability or omission of some of its theoretical or practical aspects. By investing in the unconceived – in other words, by studying archival science from practices on the margins – it is possible to renew ideas and discourses inside the discipline.",

Indeed, although persons labouring under common deaf­ness have an imperfect perception of all sounds, the degree of indistinctness of different sounds is commonly not the same; for it will be found upon examination, that they usu­ally hear sharp sounds much better than low ones; they dis­tinguish the voices of women and children better than the deeper tones in which men commonly speak; and it may be remarked, that the generality of persons accustomed to speak to those who are deaf, seem practically aware of this difference, and, even without reflecting upon the motives which guide them, acquire a habit of speaking to deaf persons in a shriller tone of voice, as a method by which they succeed in making them hear more effectually than by merely speak­ing louder.",

      "abstract": "Participatory art is characterized by a certain openness, inviting members of the audience to fill in the gaps of a work of art that is initiated by one or more visual artists. Processes of interaction, collaboration, and co-production are at the heart of this type of art practice, which started to flourish for the first time—at least in the western world—in the so-called long sixties (starting in the late 1950s and ending in the early 1970s). These temporary processes do not necessarily bring about tangible end products that can or should be preserved for the future. Participatory art projects tend to be focused on the here-and-now and the generated results are mostly characterized by mutability, multiplicity and ephemerality. To a certain extent, one needs to accept that these so-called ‘participatairy’ artworks—i.e. works that are both participatory and airy (or ephemeral) in nature—are no longer there and can, in the traditional sense, not be preserved, stored and collected for the future. But that does not mean that we should completely forget about these fleeting works or stop considering (alternative) ways to pass them on and make them ‘last.’ But how does one pass on these ephemeral forms of art, without limiting or stabilizing them? How does one keep them ‘in motion’ to prevent them from vanishing into thin air? And who should take part in these practices of safeguarding and transmission? In this ‘Spotlight article,’ I make an argument for moving from practices of co-production to practices of co-care, and for taking into account the so-called ‘living documents:’ those audience members who once participated in the events in the 1960s and 1970s and can now, when still alive, be considered valuable repositories of data, stories and memories.",

However, a closer examination reveals that, far from offering the kind of straightforward views and statements that one might expect from a work of such apparent simplicity, formal and conceptual elements are interwoven so as to elicit multiple, simultaneous, and conflicting readings. Simply put, the loa is designed to elicit questions, rather than to offer answers. Such questions, in turn, point towards a central position—the reader's or spectator's—around which the entire play gravitates. And yet, this center is constructed on such terms that it becomes a vanishing point: a presence as well as an absence, an inside and an outside, a constituting and a constituted gaze.",

But “abandon” has another meaning, that of indulging in some uninhibited action, giving oneself over completely to something, perhaps only to find later that one has lost interest or that the practice is no longer respected or understood. However enamored we may be with an action, at some point, in response to fashion or utility, we move on. To what degree this shift occurs consciously or deliberately is a matter for discussion, one that concerns the dubious term “progress” and the extent to which we are in control of the evolution of our own species—or even want to be.",

      "abstract": "Sequences of muscle activity in locomotion are basic building blocks for much of an animal's behavioural repertoire, so understanding the mechanisms which generate and control them is fundamental to a knowledge of the neuronal control of behaviour. Many movements used for locomotion are rhythmically repeating, and there are three basic questions about the control of movements such as walking, flying or swimming. First, what mechanisms ensure that muscles contract in the appropriate sequence? In walking, for example, the basic pattern is repeated flexion and then extension of each leg, with flexion of the left leg coinciding with extension of the right. Second, how does a nervous system select, start and end a particular type of movement? For example, what initiates the pattern of walking; and how is walking rather than running or swimming selected? Third, how is the basic pattern for movement modulated appropriately? Stride pattern changes, for example, when a person walks up a flight of steps or turns a corner.",

We may praise them for being courageous, charitable, just, sensitive, or magnanimous, or we may condemn their foolishness, envy or deviousness. We may neither praise nor blame, but wonder whether they were not fully responsible for what they did. Perhaps they were coerced or pressured or, perhaps, just did not know what they were doing. This language of moral evaluation does not only apply to adult human beings, but that is its primary and most typical use. Children may be selfish or act unfairly, but we accept that they only gradually acquire full moral responsibility for their actions. Animals, too, may be courageous or altruistic, but we may suspect a degree of anthropomorphism in extending moral language too far in their direction. The moral status of animals is a matter of debate, but no one thinks butterflies can have or lack charity or that jackdaws are dishonest. The rest of the world lies outside the moral realm altogether, except, perhaps, for our moral responsibilities towards it. Rocks and stones and trees do not have moral responsibilities.",

      "title": "Deconditioning and Reconditioning: Humans in Stressful Environments",
      "abstract": "Deconditioning is an integrated physiological response of the body to a reduction in metabolic rate; that is, to a reduction in energy use or in exercise level. While it may involve assumption of a horizontal body position, it certainly perturbs bodily homeostasis - at least temporarily. The reduction in physical activity that causes deconditioning is often associated with an increase in the time spent, for whatever reason, in a sitting or horizontal position. As a result, orthostatic factors may also contribute to the deconditioning mechanism. The word decondition may be defined as 1: to cause extinction of (a conditioned response) 2: to cause to lose physical fitness. This definition implies that psychological/emotional factors may accompany physical deconditioning, and it is this interpretation of the word that is used throughout this volume. It is apparent that deconditioning plays a major role in the mechanism of the general adaptive (homeostatic) response that is initiated by exposure to prolonged bed rest (BR). And the total homeostatic response to BR involves more than deconditioning per se. For example, it has been shown that the restoration of plasma volume and maximal work capacity after 4 weeks of BR deconditioning left other bodily functions (submaximal exercise oxygen uptake and cardiac output, leg proprioception and posterior leg muscle thickness and volume, head-up tilt tolerance, and sleep quality) functioning at decreased levels. The precise effect of deconditioning on BR homeostasis is difficult to determine, because the fundamental interactive neuro-endocrine-immune control networks that facilitate conditioning and deconditioning also act to maintain basic wholebody homeostasis. For example, is the mechanism of BR-induced deconditioning independent of the mechanism that provokes concomitant orthostatic intolerance; that is, fainting? Assumption of the recumbent body position for prolonged periods of time, results in a new adaptive-homeostatic state. This state occurs in response to the mutually interactive effects of the change in bodily position (hydrostatic pressure), to the virtual elimination of longitudinal pressure on the bones, to the increased confinement with possible reduction in total daily energy (exercise) expenditure, to the reorientation of stimuli within the vestibular organs, and (often) to altered socio-psychological conditions. The exercise-training (reconditioning) syndrome affects total body homeostasis by facilitating increases in work capacity and endurance, whereas deconditioning decreases physical performance. There are many interrelated factors that influence the control parameters that seek to maintain the adaptive conditioning-deconditioning syndrome. These control parameters can be better elucidated by subjecting otherwise healthy ambulatory people to various stresses, such as exercise training and prolonged spaceflight, bed rest, water immersion, hyperbaria, and isolation and confinement. Changes in control parameters will be manifested in muscle function, orthostatic tolerance, cardiorespiratory responses, musculo-skeletal systems, free-radical processes, and body thermoregulation with overarching effects on the subjects' psycho-sociological states. A discussion of these factors and the control parameters constitutes the substance of this volume. Special emphasis is placed on delineating practical applications of the findings that will be of special interest to physicians, nurses, and other health-care workers.",

Many situations, for example, cooperative hunting, group foraging, territorial defense, predator watching, or parental care, can be adequately described as a snowdrift game. In this paper, we investigate the asynchronous version of the game in which, contrary to the rather unrealistic assumption of simultaneous moves, one of the players acts first and the other responds by knowing its decision. Players are assigned to be first or second movers randomly and with the same probability. We found that both a synergistic effect of cooperation (i.e., cooperative effort is better than the sum of the individual efforts) and population structure (low dispersal, spatial confinement, or group formation) are crucial for mutual cooperation to emerge. Otherwise, only one of the players will carry the burden of cooperation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract If we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by some ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive – the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, hut until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

For most of human evolutionary history, we have faced threats in the domains of predation, conspecific violence, contagion, status loss, and dangerous nonliving environmental features. We thus very easily acquire fears directed toward threats from these domains. This chapter argues that the nonrandom distribution of human fears is reflected in horror, which features stimuli that mirror evolved fears, often in incarnations that are exaggerated and/or counterintuitive for increased salience, including giant spiders, supernormal monsters such as evil clowns, and physics-violating ghosts. Many monsters are also equipped with contagion cues, thus exploiting an evolved disgust mechanism. Some monsters evoke moral disgust through their violation of norms. To strengthen audiences’ emotional responses to such monsters, horror artists often provide descriptions of characters’ reactions which are mirrored by the audience through an adaptive mechanism enabling emotional contagion.",

      "abstract": "The institutions that work with the preservation and diffusion of cultural heritage - be them archive, libraries, museums, art galleries or cultural centres - present a certain discourse about reality. To understand this discourse, composed by sound and silence, by fullness and emptiness, by presence and absence, by remembrance and forgetting, an operation is implied, not only with the enunciation of speech and its gaps, but also the comprehension of that which causes to speak, of who is speaking and of the point whence one speaks. Preservation and destruction, or, in another way, conservation and loss, walk hand in hand in the arteries of life. As suggested by Nietzsche (1999, p.273), it is impossible to live without loss, it is entirely impossible to live avoiding destruction to play its game and drive the dynamics of life on. However, by means of a kind of tautological argument, one often justifies preservation by the imminence of loss and memory by the threat of forgetting. Thus, one ceases to consider that the game and the rules of the game between forgetting and memory are not fed by themselves and that preservation and destruction are not opposed in a deadly duel, but instead they complement one another and are always at the service of subjects that build themselves and are built through social practices. To indicate that memories and forgettings can be sown and cultivated corroborates the importance of working towards the denaturalisation of these concepts and towards the understanding that they result from a construction process also involving other forces, such as: power. Power is a sower, a promoter of memories and forgettings.",

      "title": "Altruism in behavioural, motivational and evolutionary sense",
      "abstract": "This paper discusses the relations between three forms of altruism: behavioural, evolutionary and motivational. Altruism in a behavioural sense is an act that benefits another person. It can range from volunteering to a charity and helping a neighbour, to giving money to a non-profit organisation or donating blood. People often dedicate their material and nonmaterial resources for the benefit of others to gain psychological, social and material benefits for themselves. Thus, their altruistic acts are driven by egoistic motivation. Also, the final goal of an altruistic act may be the increase in the welfare of a group or adherence to a certain moral principle or a social norm. However, at least sometimes, the welfare of others is the ultimate goal of our actions, when our altruistic acts are performed from altruistic motivation. In evolutionary sense, altruism means the sacrifice of reproductive success for the benefit of other organisms. According to evolutionary theories, behaviour which promotes the reproductive success of the receiver at the cost of the actor is favoured by natural selection, because it is either beneficial for the altruist in the long run, or for his genes, or for the group he belongs to. However, altruism among people emerges as a distinctly human combination of innate and learned behaviours. Not only do we benefit the members of our own group, but we are capable of transcending our tribalistic instincts and putting the benefit of strangers at our own personal expense as our ultimate goal.",

Across species, sounds are produced by an anatomically similar vocal tract, with humans having exceptionally large amounts of control over it. Vocal communication has also been one of the most formidable windows into the primate mind, which has resulted in considerable progress in understanding the cognitive capacities of primates. There is good evidence that primates understand a call as produced by a specific individual engaged in a specific social interaction or with an external event. In chimpanzees and bonobos, call production is goal‐directed, often strategic, and individuals can be aware of the social consequences of their calls, based on their prior interaction histories. However, so far, there is little evidence that any primate, apart from humans, communicates just to maintain a social bond or actively provides information for another.",

A time to give birth and a time to die. <i>—Ecclesiastes 3:2</i> What a privilege it is to be able to touch those sacred spaces in the soul of each person in suffering that we encounter every day. Facing our own mortality while suffering a life-threatening illness might create a cascade of distressful physical, emotional, existential/spiritual and social suffering. Patients who express living with existential/spiritual distress might express a loss of the will to live or a loss of the meaning of their lives. They also express low life satisfaction and happiness; worse sleep quality; severe anxiety and depressed mood. At the same time, expressing spiritual struggles might be related to decrease physical functioning and worse survival. Those who express spiritual distress have significantly lower self-perceived religiosity and spiritual quality of life. With any rupture in the relationships that give us meaning or purpose, no matter the cause of the rupture, our humanity suffers; our soul breaks. It is extremely important for care providers to explore and evaluate that broken soul and try to identify factors from multiple domains that promote healing processes. Embracing the spiritual care into our daily practice is a common effort and a service provided by each member of the team. Our clinical encounters need to become spiritually informed with enough time and opportunity for reflection so that we are able to talk about illness trajectories, treatment, and medical decisions on the basis of personal values, self-worth, spiritual and religious beliefs, and spiritual and religious support systems, struggles and what gives the patients meaning and purpose.

In general, we can say that the growth and development of individuals and species is characterised by several interrelated processes: the increasing complexity of the organism, its increasingly complex assessment of its environment, and the increasingly complex interrelationships between the environment and the organism.1 In the earlier stages of development the organism's parts are not very specialised. There are few centres of organisation and control. The activities of the organism are not well integrated hierarchically and a few or even one action may often involve the entire body, so that the organism cannot attend to more than a limited number of things at a time. In such circumstances, an organism's actions are said to be global and syncretic.2 In later stages the actions become more discrete, differentiated, articulated and hierarchically integrated.3",

Because victory of the self—meaning unrestrained freedom—would, given the types of weapons available today, lead to the certain destruction of man as biological organism. Similarly, victory of the other—meaning unrestrained oppression—would, given the means of coercion available today, lead to the certain destruction of man as moral agent or person.

The humanoids will meet those connotations of personhood insofar as they make commitments to one another on an open front, projecting a persona that they effectively invite others—and, interiorizing, invite themselves—to rely on: ‘this is who I am’. In order to ‘personate’ in that sense, they must be able to reason, to ascribe and assume responsibility, to be able to claim rights against one another, and to live up to the ideals of the persona they project. The person or personating agent will enjoy an important form of self-identity over time, even as they change and recognize that they change in their public profile. Not only will they be intertemporally connected in the sense that their states at any time—say, of memory or intention—reflect their states at others: say, of experience or performance. They will also be generally connected by sustaining a commitment to a certain stable or evolving persona. In this richer construal of what they are as a self, it will make sense for them to embrace an ideal of knowing themselves and being true to their self.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The act of exchanging one thing for another seems to involve a promise. The confidence needed to relinquish something one has on the understanding that one will receive what another has in exchange can be expressed in terms of resolve. In binding oneself, one thinks that if the other binds himself or herself to perform a given action (if he or she finds a certain condition fulfilled), then he or she will do that action (if he or she finds the condition fulfilled). In cases in which one person's action does not precede the other's, one's promise involves thinking that if the other binds himself or herself, then he or she will carry out the promised action.",

The term was originally used to describe the patient’s inability to differentiate their own left hand from the examiner’s left hand when placed in their right hand, behind their back. However the term has evolved, and the terminology is confusing. Alien hand syndrome, alien limb syndrome and alien limb phenomenon are synonymous and can occur in either the arms or legs. The syndrome can be broadly divided into two types, an anterior syndrome and a posterior syndrome. <b>THE ANTERIOR ALIEN HAND SYNDROME</b> This is the classic syndrome. It is a motor disorder defined by involuntary hand or arm movements that occur either in addition to or instead of a planned or willed movement.

      "abstract": "Recent research on individual differences in object cognition (OC) focused on determining how objects group together, and what type of processing lies behind the clusters-a single domain-general or multiple domain-specific processes. The expertise hypothesis suggests that all object categories are processed by the same mechanism that is responsible for differentiating visually similar objects. This ability is expected to be more specifically expressed in processing objects for which people have higher expertise. The domain-specificity hypothesis postulates that different object categories, for example, living versus nonliving objects, are processed employing different mechanisms. In the present study we aimed to study (a) how multiple objects group together in terms of individual differences; (b) the expertise hypothesis based on up-to-date statistical methods of modeling individual differences; (c) whether task difficulty influences the structure of individual differences in OC. We applied a memory task to N = 186 participants, by using multiple, theoretically chosen object categories divided into five groups-living/mobile (fish, butterflies), living/immobile (flowers, leaves), nonliving/mobile (cars, motorbikes), nonliving/immobile (houses, chairs) and faces-and report three main findings. (a) In terms of individual differences, the factor space of OC can be accounted by three factors-general OC factor along with a specific Vehicle and Face factor; (b) there is no clear evidence for the expertise hypothesis; and (c) task difficulty does not influence the OC structure. We conclude that domain-specific mechanisms in object processing cannot be dismissed. (PsycINFO Database Record",

      "abstract": "In addition to the many easily observable differences between people, there are also differences in people's subjective experiences that are harder to observe, and which, as a consequence, remain hidden. For example, people vary widely in how much visual imagery they experience. But those who cannot see in their mind's eye, tend to assume everyone is like them. Those who can, assume everyone else can as well. We argue that a study of such hidden phenomenal differences has much to teach cognitive science. Uncovering and describing this variation (a search for unknown unknowns) may help predict otherwise puzzling differences in human behavior. The very existence of certain differences can also act as a stress test for some cognitive theories. Finally, studying hidden phenomenal differences is the first step toward understanding what kinds of environments may mask or unmask links between phenomenal experience and observable behavior.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The body schema can interact with perception, cognition, and behavior in a variety of ways. In some cases, the body schema is used as a representational device in service of higher cognitive functions. Examples include covert articulation in working memory, mentally counting on one’s fingers to assist with internal calculations, and mentally rotating one’s hand or one’s whole body during a spatial reasoning task. In other cases, the body schema provides a bridge between perception and action, treating perceived objects as things to be manipulated with the body. This has been explored in the literatures on perception-for-action and the “how” system of visual processing. In still other cases, the body schema again interfaces with perception, but does something rather different with the input. Instead of planning interactive or manipulative behaviors, the body schema may encode the stimulus essentially by copying it. This may occur in particular with stimuli that, in some relevant way, match our own bodies. When we see other people sitting, standing, and moving, we are perceiving a stimulus that is isomorphic to the body that we ourselves inhabit and cause to move.",

This study aims to better know information than these avatars convey by their presence in order to reinforce the messages contained in the application and to avoid the misinterpretations or ambiguity they could bring if this factor is not controlled.The principal results of the experimentation are the following: • In any type of virtual environment, the avatars bring realism and \"life\". In a nonfamiliar environment, they also allow to provide indications on the work and the activity in environnement, in particular with their working clothes and actions. • Nevertheless, to be appreciated and effective, these avatars will be sufficiently realistic and their behaviors must be relevant compared to environnement. Mobility alone is not enough, their actions must be coordinated, fluid and be centered on an identifiable objective of task. The clothes of the civil avatars must also be considered because it conveys a significant psychosociological dimension.",

      "abstract": "One reason for the apparent gulf between animal and human communication systems is that the focus has been on the presence or the absence of language as a complex expressive system built on speech. But language normally occurs embedded within an interactional exchange of multi-modal signals. If this larger perspective takes central focus, then it becomes apparent that human communication has a layered structure, where the layers may be plausibly assigned different phylogenetic and evolutionary origins—especially in the light of recent thoughts on the emergence of voluntary breathing and spoken language. This perspective helps us to appreciate the different roles that the different modalities play in human communication, as well as how they function as one integrated system despite their different roles and origins. It also offers possibilities for reconciling the ‘gesture-first hypothesis’ with that of gesture and speech having evolved together, hand in hand—or hand in mouth, rather—as one system.",

Or, as Searle (1992) has argued: all utterances within conversations are necessarily related to each other, internally; they have shared intentionality. Within situations with shared intentionality, it is as if the situation itself is an ethically active, living entity that, as much as the others around us, requires our respect. Thus, like the others around us, `it' also can exert a formative influence upon what we do within it.

      "title": "The shape of you: do individuals associate particular geometric shapes with identity?",
      "abstract": "Abstract For more than a century, psychologists have been interested in how visual information can arouse emotions. Several studies have shown that rounded shapes evoke positive feelings due to their link with happy/baby-like expressions, compared with sharp angular shapes, usually associated with anger and threatening objects having negative valence. However, to date, no-one has investigated the preference to associate simple geometric shapes to personal identities, including one’s own, that of a close acquainted, or that of a stranger. Through 2 online surveys we asked participants to associate a geometric shape, chosen among a circle, a square and a triangle, to each of three identities, namely “you” (the self), “your best friend” or “a stranger”. We hypothesized that the circle would be more associated with the self, the square with the friend and the triangle with the stranger. Moreover, we investigated whether these associations are modulated by 3 personality traits: aggressivity, social fear and empathy. As predicted, we found that participants associate more often the circle with the self, both the circle and the square with the best friend, whereas they matched angular shapes (both the triangle and the square) to the stranger. On the other hand, the possibility that personality traits can modulate such associations was not confirmed. The study of how people associate geometric figures with the self or with other identities giving them an implicit socio-affective connotation, is interesting for all the disciplines interested in the automatic affective processes activated by visual stimuli.",

It is conditioned by how human activities are performed, as comfort level may foster or hamper people performing their tasks due to the effects of human physiological and psychological perceptions and reactions to different situations and environmental conditions.

      "abstract": "“Mind to Mind”:Tolkien’s Faërian Drama and the Middle English Sir Orfeo1 Kelley M. Wickham-Crowley (bio) Now “Faërian Drama”—those plays, which according to abundant records the elves have often presented to men—can produce Fantasy with a realism and immediacy beyond the compass of any human mechanism. As a result their usual effect (upon a man) is to go beyond Secondary Belief. If you are present at a Faërian drama you yourself are, or think that you are, bodily inside its Secondary World. The experience may be very similar to Dreaming and has (it would seem) sometimes (by men) been confounded with it. But [in Faërian Drama you are in a dream that some other mind is weaving, and] the knowledge of that alarming fact may slip from your grasp. …2 You are deluded—whether that is the intention of the elves (always or at any time) is another question. They at any rate are not themselves deluded. This is for them a form of Art, and distinct from Wizardry or Magic, properly so called. They do not live in it, though they can, perhaps, afford to spend more time at it than human artists can. The Primary World, Reality, of elves and men is the same, if differently valued and perceived. (OFS 63, ¶74) … faierie a state of being in which the will can more or less directly cause things imagined or desired actually to be, or can at least present them to the senses; and the very immediacy of the operation enhances the quality of the product: beautiful things produced by faierie retain the beauty of the vision that precedes the making … (OFS 255) Between every two trees is a doorway to a new world. (Attributed to John Muir)3 J.R.R. Tolkien’s foundational theories of “On Fairy-stories” include the coining of the term “eucatastrophe,” the definition of subcreation, a term first implied by George MacDonald4 though without the expansion Tolkien gave it, and the concept of Secondary Belief in a created Secondary World. But another phrase, Faërian drama, has gone mainly undiscussed as a literary term except in some of Verlyn Flieger’s work,5 perhaps for obvious reasons. It appears as a somewhat peculiar [End Page 1] reference to what fairies/elves might create as art but becomes a springboard for philosophical and metaphysical considerations of how two created species with inherently different minds might communicate what is most central to their experience of the world. On one level, “On Fairy-stories” is a manifesto, as Verlyn Flieger has rightly called it (“Fairy-tale” 27). It does not simply attempt to discuss the terms, rules, and history of what are commonly called fairy tales; it declares Fantasy the highest form of human literary art because, motivated by a desire to be closer to the original creator of worlds, it attempts in its subcreated worlds to imitate that maker. It offers reasons why the desire to tell a story that gives us new ways to see the world, that turns unexpectedly to joy, is central to any being and its health, but even more, central to the created world and its purpose. Within an essay with such a sweeping context for human art, then, Faërian drama initially seems paradoxically important and a minor aside. Tolkien invites us to acknowledge that “fairy-stories” are really human stories about Faërie and its immortals, and asserts that Faërie in its own art would consider humans and mortality as similarly puzzling and alien. Both bodies of stories would inevitably be partial and sometimes in error, constrained by the minds and natures of each. Of what use then, perhaps especially in an academic essay, is an imagined art and genre for an equally imagined or even nonexistent race of artists? The key here is Tolkien’s refusal to separate his scholarly and intellectual interests from his urge, as a created being, to create fiction and fictional settings that command credibility. He had to work out the metaphysical possibilities of Faërie art, constituted by him here under the term “Faërian drama,” to create his own...",

      "abstract": "“More Human Than Human”:“Flattening of Affect,” Synthetic Humans, and the Social Construction of Maleness Jordana Greenblatt We’re all schizophrenic, with defective emotional lives—flattening of affect, it’s called. What I’ve done … that’s become alien to me. In fact everything about me has become unnatural; I’ve become an unnatural self. Philip K. Dick Do Androids Dream of Elecric Sheep? In philip k. dick’s novel, androids are unable to empathize with or feel for others. Their absence of spontaneous emotional response to hypothetical scenarios is the diagnostic used to distinguish them from humans. Androids’ disconnection from others and lack of affective response constitute the “affective flattening” to which Pris, an android, refers, understood in Dick’s novel as a defect that, when unattributable to mental illness, marks one as other than human. Thus, above, Pris lies to her human interlocutor, misattributing the cause of her affective flattening in order to provide a human explanation for the feature used to identify androids, who are subject to being “retired,” a euphemism for their summary execution. In this affective deficit and its implications for human identity, Pris [End Page 41] and her fellow androids (“andys”) are hardly alone. Dick’s novel, Ridley Scott’s film adaptation, Blade Runner, and (writer) Ronald Moore and (producer) David Eick’s recent Battlestar Galactica television series are a few examples of a trend that proliferates from the 1950s onwards.1 In such science-fiction texts, humans build and often come into conflict with beings that have been created by humans or have evolved from those created by humans. These beings are almost indistinguishable from humans, except, of course, for that all-important lack of emotional connection: that necessary flattening of affect. While critics generally frame such texts as questioning the nature of the human,2 they represent specifically gendered anxieties. Synthetic humans are distinguished from “real” humans by a particular form of emotional insufficiency. While they usually do feel, they generally lack abilities to know and understand their feelings, feel in relation to others, and/or empathize with or understand the feelings of others. Commenting on the historical shift in the attributes characterizing synthetic humans, Despina Kakoudaki argues that “If for Descartes … automata differ from people because they have … no reason, by the early twentieth century artificial people differ from real people because all they have is reason” (181). Andys, replicants, and Galactica’s Cylons can all have implanted memories, which means that characters can be synthetic without knowing it. Given that the shift Kakoudaki identifies undermines modernity’s ideal of the human-as-rational-subject, it is unsurprising that the Galactica character who most persistently questions whether or not he is a Cylon [End Page 42] is Gaius Baltar, whom we initially meet as a scientist with an important role in the human Colonies’ defense system and who places great stock in his own rationality. Both Baltar’s investment in rationality and his sex are relevant; given white, Western maleness’s (and normative masculinity’s) association with logic, reason, and denying and flattening affect and femaleness’s (and normative femininity’s) with emotionality, emotional intelligence, and empathy, any sense that emotionality defines the human has gendered implications. Modernity’s rational subject, associated with Enlightenment ideals and the Classical traditions they draw on, is one whose maleness, Westernness, and whiteness has historically been used as the measure against which disenfranchised groups, including women, people of colour, and the colonized, have fallen short, judged insufficiently rational and overly emotional. It is therefore his identity that comes into question when reason is no longer a guarantor of human identity. As Alison Jagger notes, The western tradition has not seen everyone as equally emotional. Instead, reason has been associated with members of dominant political, social, and cultural groups and emotion with members of subordinate groups. Prominent among these subordinate groups in our society are people of color, except for supposedly “inscrutable orientals,” and women. (157)3 As emotion replaces rationality as the metric distinguishing humanity from its synthetic doubles, the science-fiction characters that most question if they are human are the rationalist scientist (Galactica) and the hardboiled man of action (Androids and Blade...",

      "title": "Spirituality throughout the Phases of Change in Suffering",
      "abstract": "Traumatising, life-changing events, including severe illness or war, can exert a profound effect on spirituality. The empirically validated Fennell Four Phase Treatment (FFPT™) model provides a narrative framework and cognitive map for understanding and integrating suffering resulting from these events. The four phases - 1. Crisis, 2. Stabilisation, 3. Resolution, and 4. Integration - describe a predictable passage that people navigate after significant change. Within each phase, the model addresses three domains: physical, spiritual/psychological, and social. Many people in the Crisis phase feel spiritually abandoned. They feel at fault and that God is punishing them, or does not exist at all. In the first wretchedness, it is easy to believe that life is meaningless. People experience 'Godlessness' and need to be responded to with comfort as they learn to allow their suffering. When patients arrive at phase 2, they no longer feel that God is punishing them, but rather that God is absent or indifferent. People often seek the stabilising influence of hierarchical beliefs as they learn to regard their suffering with compassion. In phase 3, people search for meaning to validate their experiences and to find reasons for their suffering and struggle. To attempt serious investigation in Phase 1 or 2 would be premature. Phase 3 people, however, have changed. They become committed to authenticity as they construct a new self. This drive toward truth and meaning extends to their spirituality or philosophy as they learn to treat their suffering with respect. In phase 4, people are increasingly aware of meaning on all levels of their experience. Previously, they sought answers to the big existential questions, now they seek meaning throughout their activities. They understand the search is ongoing and that authenticity is a requirement. As they learn to integrate their suffering, they commit to living with paradox in the mystery.",

One of the ways to achieve diaphragmatic breathing is the method that learned about from Pyatnitsky: while speaking some monologue or verse, one follow not so much the words and their meaning, but rather make sure that one's stomach rises and deflates; and he recommended not breathing in until one're entirely out of breath. In order for an actor to practically understand that in life he is also psychologically breathing in, holding his breath, and breathing out, one often use a simple method: ask him the most common, mundane questions about his day.",

      "title": "The Role of Emotion in Ethical Decisionmaking",
      "abstract": "Role of Emotion in Ethical Decisionmaking What is the moral significance of may feelings when I hear that newly dead human bodies are used in car crashes for research on automobile safety? What should I make of the emotions aroused by the news that dying old persons will have their food and water withdrawn, or in other instances, be straitjacketed and forcibly fed? And does my emotional response to the dilemmas presented by AIDS or surrogate motherhood count? Everyone agrees that bioethical decisions, involving as they often do matters of life, death, sex reproduction, and familial and professional loyalties, can arouse emotional responses. What is not agreed upon is whether, or how, one should weigh emotions when trying to resolve an ethical dilemma. A completely rationalist view dismisses the role of emotions with the assertion that are one thing, sentiments another, and nothing fogs the mind so thoroughly as [1] Adherents of this negative estimate of emotion would advise a person confronting an ethical dilemma to arrive at a decision using rational considerations alone. As Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. says in his widely hailed book on bioethics, we should see the affirmations of one's feelings as irrational, surd, and seek to become impartial reasoners whose only interests are in the consistency and force of rational argument. [2] Other philosophers may begrudgingly admit the inevitability of emotive intuitions, to gut feelings in moral argumentation but vigorously resist employing As James Rachels puts it, The idea cannot be to avoid reliance on unsupported 'sentiments' (to use Hume's word) altogether--that is impossible. idea is always to be suspicious of them, and to rely on as few as possible, only after examining them critically, and only after pushing the arguments and explanations as far as they will go without them. [3] Joel Feinberg contends that emotions always should be subordinated to reason in the process of decisionmaking. Feinberg is not unappreciative of moral emotions, but they can never serve as an ethical criterion. A sentimental attachment to fetuses, corpses, or body parts should not be allowed to thwart the interests of actual living persons who need abortions, organ transplants, or automobile safety research. For emotions to count in any applied ethical decisions, they must be justified on independent grounds. [4] I propose a model for the mutual interaction of thinking and feeling in ethical decisionmaking. Certainly, reason should monitor reason as in traditional philosophical critiques, and reason should tutor the emotions as in Feinberg's model. But I would also claim that emotion should tutor reason and that emotion should monitor emotion. ideal goal is to come to an ethical decision through a personal equilibrium in which emotion and reason are both activated and in accord. Human Emotions in Psychology What do we now think we know about the functioning of human beings that should make us take emotions more seriously in ethical enterprises? human emotional system is a universal component of human functioning, the primary motivating system of all activity, including of course, thinking about ethical dilemmas. Following Darwin's lead, psychological theorists now see human emotions, like human cognitive capacities, to have been selected through evolution to ensure the survival of individuals and the group. [5] Emotions are energizing and adaptive, and serve communicating, bonding, and motivating functions. They seem to be distinct from either physiological drives or cognitive processes, although complex interactions and learned associations occur. Without emotions or affects to amplify physiological drives and infuse cognitive processing with subjective meaning, human beings would not care enough to stay alive, much less mate, nurture offspring, create kindship bonds, or pursue art, science, literature, or moral philosophy. …",

These children ask the big questions early, challenging adults to defend the way the world works; adults for the most part fail to answer the questions or even take them seriously. Struggling to make sense of the world on their own, children may doubt the integrity and intelligence of adults, and ultimately the sanity of their own species. They must then engage in an effort to define self either as part of or as separate from that species, from which they feel isolated and alienated, and yet with which they also have a powerful sense of connection. The psychic conflict at the core of the effort to define themselves may lead to giving up on life, on humanity or on self. The task of adults is to recognize the value of children whose development challenges the “world as it is” and help them make the choice in favor of their own, unique vision, a vision that can lead to spiritual growth for the child and moral evolution for humanity.",

      "title": "Containing Multitudes: Reflection, Expertise and Persons as Groups",
      "abstract": "From time to time, philosophers like to raise the possibility of the existence of group minds or group persons. In order for something to be interestingly and appropriately described as a group person it must satisfy two conditions. First, it must itself exhibit various characteristics that are distinctive of persons. Unless it did this, it would not be a group person. Secondly, it must be composed of entities that are themselves persons or relevantly person-like. Without this, it would not be a group person. It is the difficulty of seeing how these two conditions can be satisfied together that has made the existence and possible natures of group persons problematic. For the things that paradigmatically satisfy the first condition, namely persons, are not obviously thought of as being composed of person-like entities related in some group-like way. And the things that paradigmatically satisfy the second condition, such as sports teams, committees and string quartets, are not obviously thought of as themselves displaying personal characteristics. Investigators of group persons – though not always thinking of themselves as such – have usually approached the problem by starting with paradigmatic and uncontroversial groups and exploring the extent to which personal characteristics can be attributed to them. Since it would be unreasonable to expect such groups to exhibit, even in some possibly attenuated way, all the characteristics of an ordinary person, attention is usually directed to some subset of these characteristics. Can such a group have a single consciousness? Can it be the subject of intentional mental states like belief? Can it act? Can it be guilty?",

While primary emotions require a self to experience the state (Lewis and Michalson, 1983), self-conscious emotions require a self both to produce the state and then to experience it. For example, a loud noise may put me in a state of fright. But to experience this state, I need to be aware of my state of fright. To be in a state of shame I must compare my action against some standard, either my own or someone else's. My failure, relative to the standard, results in a state of shame. Once in the state, I may or may not experience it. To experience it depends on whether I focus my attention on my state. Again, this requires consciousness. Others have suggested that the state of shame can be produced in a more automatic fashion, one that does not require objective self-awareness.

Most of the confusion and sterility of discussions on the moral function is due to lack of attention to this process of defence. The moral function is a protective function. The activity of the moral function is one of Man's most precious cultural achievements, and until we know much more about it a dogmatic attitude is more likely to be injurious than helpful.

      "title": "ARE SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS TERMINABLE?",
      "abstract": "2012 Sedentary behaviors are commonly believed to be interminable. That is, relapse looms over all those involved in physical activity. There is evidence to support this assertion. For example, initial physical activity periods are often followed by relapse episodes or complete withdrawal. Also, very few people are physically active on a regular basis and activity levels appear to decrease with age. Some people do, however, remain physically active for long periods of time - perhaps even indefinitely. What is unique about these people? To answer this question constructs from the Transtheoretical Model (TM) of behavior change were examined. The first construct examined was the \"maintenance\" stage of change. People in maintenance have sustained physical activity involvement for periods lasting at least 6 months. The second construct was the \"transformed\" stage of change. People in this stage have sustained physical activity involvement for 5 or more years and, importantly, are 100% confident this can be continued indefinitely. A third construct, not directly accounted for in TM, may also emerge (i.e., \"long-term maintenance\"). People placed here have sustained physical activity involvement for 5 or more years, but do not believe this can be continued indefinitely. Using these decision rules, 306 people (M age = 40 yr.; 59.9% female; 93.1% Caucasian) were classified as follows: 24.8% maintainers, 52.3% long-term maintainers, and 22.9% transformed. With stage serving as the independent variable, participants were compared on: age, attitude toward role modeling (ATRM), BMI, self-perceived physical activity, self-perceived fitness, and exercise METS. Overall group differences were observed (p<0.01). In follow-up tests, mean scores followed a gradient pattern of improvement from maintenance through transformed. ATRM and self-perceived fitness best described the differences observed between the three groups. In summary, preliminary support is offered to suggest a possible transformed stage of change. On the basis of our findings, it would appear that people reaching this stage have robust cognitive profiles in terms of an underlying construct we have labeled \"self-image.\"",

In fact, the motif of dreams presents a different way of realizing the motif of space, Andrić’s characters are equally realized through it, they live and act in it. This is the result of Andrić’s general interest in human beings and his continuous reflection on their psychology and life. Since the reality and dreams represent the inseparable parts of human life and nature, Andrić is interested in the totality of their variations, following all mutual interrelationships and effects on human beings, their life and psychology. Andrić’s reflection on human beings (their body, spirituality, destiny, life) is not intended to disclose or establish systematic accuracy or organization, but, on the contrary, it is aimed at dynamics, disharmony, and disorder observed in the overall complexity of individual cases. The functions and appearances of the motif of dreams in the short stories are various and numerous: as a long-awaited and unfulfilled desire floating in front of eyes; as a spiritual continuation of real life or an attempt to escape from it; as an extension of suffering, torture and fear; as a hallucination or vision; as an inexplicable punishment, award or a struggle with own consciousness; as a rest; as a sign and hint, etc.",

      "title": "Case Studies in Interdisciplinary Research",
      "abstract": "Humans are capable of understanding an incredible variety of actions performed by other humans. Even though these range from primary biological actions like eating and fleeing, to acts in parliament or in poetry, humans generally can make sense of each other’s actions. Understanding other people’s action, called can transcend differences in race, gender, culture, age, and social and historical circumstances. Action understanding is the cognitive capability of making sense of another person’s action by integrating perceptual information about the behavior with knowledge about the immediate and socio-cultural contexts of the action and with one’s own experience. Since it is necessary to integrate multiple sources of information, it is not surprising that failures to understand a person’s behavior are also common. Well known is the case of an autistic professor who compares herself to an anthropologist from Mars. Incapable of spontaneously understanding why someone cries, she has learned rules that help her to infer that people who rub their eyes while tears are running down their cheeks are weeping and probably feel unhappy (Sacks, 1995). By contrast, normal individuals automatically allow stereotypes, prejudices, self-interests and the like to influence their understanding a person’s behavior (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999). More generally still, humans can easily misunderstand unfamiliar symbolic actions or rituals if they rely too much on their own socio-cultural expertise (Gadamer, 2004). Given the importance of action understanding in every domain of human life and society, and in light of the complexities that surround it, a comprehensive scientific understanding of this capacity is needed. Apart from satisfying intellectual curiosity, such insight would serve to improve our action understanding and mitigate several forms of misunderstanding. Indeed, in studying action understanding, we as scientists are engaged in the very process that is central to our concerns (Gergen & Semin, 1990, p. 1). Scholars are increasingly dissatisfied with mono-disciplinary approaches to understanding human action. Such one-sidedness can rest upon various motives. For example, hermeneutic interpretations of action understanding tend to emphasize historical and cultural influences while overlooking that ultimately such influences depend upon individual cognitive processes.1 This has led to a critique of the assumption that humans are born as a blank slate and that culture is solely responsible for all cognitive contents. However, such critique easily slides into an overemphasis on the biology of human nature and a denial of socio-cultural influences on cognition (Pinker, 2003). Fortunately, recent interdisciplinary endeavors have shown that an interdisciplinary approach is preferable when investigating complex functions like action understanding. Such research often involves developing a new interdiscipline such as cultural psychology (Bruner, 1990) or combining insights from the social sciences and psychology (Shore, 1996; Sperber, 1996). Evidence shows that throughout human evolution there have been mutual influences between biological and cognitive processes that shape human capacities and socio-cultural influences on those processes (Bogdan, 2003; Donald, 1991; Tomasello, 1999). In addition to these interdisciplinary investigations, computational sciences and artificial intelligence research are developing computer models of human understanding that allow new types of experiments and simulations (Churchland, 1995). Such insights underscore the necessity and fruitfulness of disciplinary boundary crossing and require that various disciplinary methods, concepts and theories be combined in innovative ways.",

To put this in more cognitive terms, if you want to know whether an object is a category member, start with a representation of the object and a representation of the potential category. Then determine the similarity of the object representation to the category representation. If this similarity value is high enough, then the object belongs to the category; otherwise, it does not. For example, suppose you come across a white three-dimensional object with an elliptical profile; or suppose you read or hear a description like the one I just gave you. You can calculate a measure of the similarity between your mental representation of this object and your prior representation of categories it might fit into. Depending on the outcome of this calculation, you might decide that similarity warrants calling the object an egg, perhaps, or a turnip or a Christmas ornament.",

      "title": "332 What’s causing obesity in pets and what can we do about it?",
      "abstract": "Abstract The majority of dogs (56%) and cats (60%) are now overweight or obese. A novel theory posits that obesity in pets is due to “treats” and excessive meal amounts given by the “pet-parent” to obtain affection from the pet, which enables “‘eating addiction” in the pet and results in pet-parent “co-dependence.” The pet-parent may even become hostage to the treats/food to avoid the ire of the pet. Eating addiction in the pet appears related to stress/conflict, involving the displacement mechanism, which is a bio-behavioral mechanism in the brains of all animals, even fruit flies. It allows the animal to deal with situations that cannot readily be faced or avoided or are thwarting, such as social isolation. Displacement behavior is out-of-context, irrepressible behavior, e.g. an animal in the wild who sleeps or feeds when threatened by a predator. It is thought due to re-channeling of overflow brain energy to another drive (e.g. feeding drive) when two drives, e.g. fight or flight, equally oppose each other. Moving the opposing drives out of equilibrium, by resolving the animal’s stressful life situations, theoretically halts the displacement mechanism and addictive behavior, e.g. overeating/obesity.

Results: Discovering the visual principle of perceiving or judging the shape of objects of straight shape (columnar shape); creating/finding new method of research life activity law, or even creating/establishing a new interdisciplinary subject–perceptual geometry. Conclusion: If the difference between the slope values of any two lines of sight that reflected from any equidistant adjacent two points on an object to the eye is the constant, and is consistently equal to i/m; this object must be the object that is perceived or judged to be straight shape (columnar shape), otherwise, perceived or judged as Fold or curve shape. This is the geometric visual principle of perceiving or judging the shape of object. The human body can perceives and judges the shape of object by perceiving the contraction activity law of the muscles supporting the activity of sensory organ. Obviously, action can not be perceived if it can not be encoded. Vertigo and some other symptoms are caused by the brain’s ability to perceive movement weakened or disappeared.Some scientific questions can be answered by experiments.

      "abstract": "New research demonstrates systematic errors of tactile localisation, involving confusions of body parts and body sides. Such errors do not follow the organisation of topographic maps in somatosensory cortex, suggesting that tactile localisation involves coding of abstract features of limbs. New research demonstrates systematic errors of tactile localisation, involving confusions of body parts and body sides. Such errors do not follow the organisation of topographic maps in somatosensory cortex, suggesting that tactile localisation involves coding of abstract features of limbs. The skin can convey many sensations, which are translated into our ability to perceive, for instance, the smooth texture of a marble statue or the pinprick of a mosquito bite. Common to all these sensations is the phenomenological experience that they occur somewhere on the body. Indeed, unlike other bodily sensations such as hunger or fatigue, it is difficult to conceive of a tactile sensation which can be felt but not localized, whether in its current true spatial location or in an erroneous one [1de Vignemont F. Mind the Body: An Exploration of Bodily Self-awareness. University Press, Oxford2018Google Scholar]. Even in the extreme case of patients who are unable to locate tactile sensations correctly, touches are not perceived floating in the air but as happening somewhere within the confines of their body [2Halligan P.W. Hunt M. Marshall J.C. Wade D.T. Sensory detection without localization.Neurocase. 1995; 1: 259-266Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Head H. Holmes G. Sensory disturbances from cerebral lesions.Brain. 1911; 34: 102-254Crossref Google Scholar]. Touches on the body are initially represented in the cortex in an orderly topographic manner, so that adjacent parts of the skin are represented by adjacent bits of the brain [4Penfield W. Boldrey E. Somatic motor and sensory representation in the cerebral cortex of man as studied by electrical stimulation.Brain. 1937; 60: 389-443Crossref Scopus (2702) Google Scholar]. This has been famously illustrated in textbook depictions of Penfield's sensory homunculus in the primary somatosensory cortex, S1 (Figure 1). Given this cortical topography, one might assume that the problem of localising a touch on the skin reduces to localising a corresponding peak of activation in these somatotopic maps. Indeed, several studies have shown that the brain can represent tactile location via population coding within somatotopic maps [5Nicolelis M.A. Ghazanfar A.A. Stambaugh C.R. Oliveira L.M. Laubach M. Chapin J.K. Nelson R.J. Kaas J.H. Simultaneous encoding of tactile information by three primate cortical areas.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar], and some reports of mislocalizations in amputees suggest a dependency on homuncular organization, as when touches on the ipsilateral face, which is adjacent to the hand in the homunculus, evoke tactile sensations on the phantom hand and fingers [6Borsook D. Becerra L. Fishman S. Edwards A. Jennings C.L. Stojanovic M. Papinicolas L. Ramachandran V.S. Gonzalez R.G. Breiter H. Acute plasticity in the human somatosensory cortex following amputation.Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar]. A new study by Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar], reported in this issue of Current Biology, challenges this 'homuncular' view and delivers important new insight into how our nervous system relies on abstract features or categorical information to locate touch. Existing neurocognitive models of somatosensory processing have suggested that localizing a touch within a somatotopic map is not by itself sufficient to localize the stimulus on the body surface, but that this requires higher-order body representations (for example [8Longo M.R. Azañón E. Haggard P. More than skin deep: body representation beyond primary somatosensory cortex.Neuropsychologia. 2010; 48: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar]). In the early 20th century, before the discovery of the topographical architecture of the somatosensory cortex [4Penfield W. Boldrey E. Somatic motor and sensory representation in the cerebral cortex of man as studied by electrical stimulation.Brain. 1937; 60: 389-443Crossref Scopus (2702) Google Scholar], Head and Holmes [3Head H. Holmes G. Sensory disturbances from cerebral lesions.Brain. 1911; 34: 102-254Crossref Google Scholar] had already proposed a mental representation of the body surface to account for the deficits of patients who could detect touch but were unable to localize where on the body the touch was. This representation has come to be called the superficial schema. We do not have to go so far from our daily routines to envision the need for such representation. Now spare a thought for the kid who is learning to play the guitar. With training, the cortical representation of the fingertips of her left hand, which she uses for fingering the strings on the fretboard, will enlarge compared with that of other kids of her age [9Elbert T. Pantev C. Wienbruch C. Rockstroh B. Taub E. Increasd cortical represntation of the fingers of the left hand in string players.Science. 1995; 270: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar]. But how, after such cortical changes, is she still able to localize touch without producing massive mislocalizations? This is where a body representation such as the superficial schema comes into play in some neurocognitive models, as a link between cortical maps and body locations that is updated to reflect plastic changes to those maps, and that accounts for their inherent distortions and magnifications [8Longo M.R. Azañón E. Haggard P. More than skin deep: body representation beyond primary somatosensory cortex.Neuropsychologia. 2010; 48: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar]. Nevertheless, such models have difficulty accounting for puzzling mislocalizations observed in some amputees, where tactile stimuli on a foot are occasionally attributed to the absent hand [6Borsook D. Becerra L. Fishman S. Edwards A. Jennings C.L. Stojanovic M. Papinicolas L. Ramachandran V.S. Gonzalez R.G. Breiter H. Acute plasticity in the human somatosensory cortex following amputation.Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar], because the hand and foot representations are far apart in the somatosensory homunculus (Figure 1). More than a century after Head and Homes' [3Head H. Holmes G. Sensory disturbances from cerebral lesions.Brain. 1911; 34: 102-254Crossref Google Scholar] first insights into tactile localization, Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] have provided remarkable evidence for mislocalizations in healthy individuals that are, as in the example with the amputees, not determined either by the sensory homunculus or the superficial schema. They have found that, when touched on a limb, healthy adults occasionally — but systematically — misattribute the touch to a limb that was not touched at all. Many of these 'phantom errors' were attributed to the homologous contralateral limb, for example the right hand for a touch on the left hand. This pattern could potentially be explained by reliance on the somatosensory homunculus, given growing evidence of the existence of bilateral receptive fields [10Iwamura Y. Iriki A. Tanaka M. Bilateral hand representation in the postcentral somatosensory cortex.Nature. 1994; 369: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar] and inter-hemispheric interactions [11Tamè L. Braun C. Lingnau A. Schwarzbach J. Demarchi G. Li Hegner Y. Farnè A. Pavani F. The contribution of primary and secondary somatosensory cortices to the representation of body parts and body sides: an fMRI adaptation study.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2012; 24: 2306-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar] as early as in S1 (reviewed in [12Tamè L. Azañón E. Longo M.R. A conceptual model of tactile processing across body features of size, shape, side, and spatial location.Front. Psychol. 2019; 10: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar]). However, a smaller set of phantom errors were systematically attributed to opposite limb types, for example a foot for a hand and vice-versa, which excludes overlapping representations in S1 as a source of these phantom errors, because the hand and foot representations are far apart in S1. One possibility could be that these mislocalizations might arise from overlapping representations in secondary somatosensory cortex, S2, where the foot and hand representations are adjacent, at least in monkeys [13Pons T.P. Garraghty P.E. Mishkin M. Lesion-induced plasticity in the second somatosensory cortex of adult macaques.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 85: 5279-5281Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar]. But an explanation based on adjacent representations in S2 could only partially account for the pattern of mislocalizations observed in Badde et al.'s study [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar]: while it could explain why phantom errors are more frequent across feet and hands sharing the same body side, it cannot account for the fact that mislocalizations are more often than chance referred to the limb placed at the stimulated limb's canonical side of space (which for the right hand would be the right side of space, for example). The mislocalizations reported by Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] are therefore consistent with their resulting from representations in which touch is coded in terms of a number of abstract features, rather than as a spatial map. This way of representing touch may be related to some other results in the literature. For example, interleaving the fingers of a hand can lead to confusions about which hand is touched, but not which finger, despite the fact that finger type and laterality could both rely on the same activity in S1 [14Haggard P. Kitadono K. Press C. Taylor-Clarke M. The brain's fingers and hands.Exp. Brain. Res. 2006; 172: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar]. Similarly, the pattern of mislocalizations at the hairy and glabrous skin are virtually identical, despite being clearly different at the level of S1, which suggest the use of a representation abstracting away from the details of each individual skin surface [15Manser-Smith K. Tamè L. Longo M.R. Tactile confusions of the fingers and toes.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 2018; 44: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar]. The pattern of mislocalizations reported by Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] provides new and exciting insight into the type of information that is needed to encode location, and appears to implicate the use of representations based on body-related categorical information. This idea fits with recent studies showing that motor representations of the body in the posterior parietal cortex show substantial degrees of mixed selectivity, with common responses to movements made with different body parts, or by the left and right hands (for example [16Zhang C.Y. Aflalo T. Revechkis B. Rosario E.R. Ouellette D. Pouratian N. Andersen R.A. Partially mixed selectivity in human posterior parietal association cortex.Neuron. 2017; 95: 697-708.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar]). The new results suggest that similar mixed coding may also be employed in touch (Figure 1). A representation based on high-dimensional mixed-selectivity would produce very different patterns of confusions and errors than one based on topographic maps. The phantom errors reported by Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] emphasise three relevant features, in decreasing order of importance: body part's identity (a hand or a foot); body laterality (right or left); and canonical spatial location. The illusory percepts resemble those obtained in vision, the so-called illusory conjunctions, in which people report single objects having a combination of features which were not actually presented [17Treisman A. The binding problem. Curr.Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar]. Indeed, Badde et al.'s [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] results can be thought of as a form of illusory conjunction on touch based on the features of limbs. Studies of illusory conjunctions in vision show that such conjunctions are modulated by stimulus similarity [17Treisman A. The binding problem. Curr.Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar]. The results of Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] suggest that a similar process might take place in touch, and demonstrate at least three relevant categorical features along which similarity is defined. For instance, phantom errors typically matched the correct limb with respect to limb type and body side. Interestingly, a third feature is the body part's canonical location. Several accounts have highlighted, based on indirect evidence, the role of the body part's canonical location in tactile localization at initial stages of sensory processing. For instance, by assuming that immediately following stimulation touch is referred to a stored representation of the default posture [8Longo M.R. Azañón E. Haggard P. More than skin deep: body representation beyond primary somatosensory cortex.Neuropsychologia. 2010; 48: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar] (reviewed in [12Tamè L. Azañón E. Longo M.R. A conceptual model of tactile processing across body features of size, shape, side, and spatial location.Front. Psychol. 2019; 10: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar]). Badde et al.'s [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] results provide direct evidence for the existence of such canonical representations. Perhaps one of the most surprising findings of Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] is that the external location of the touched limb did not predict the pattern of mislocalizations across hand and foot. This contradicts the widespread idea that touch takes the posture of the touched limb into account even in situations where there is no overt reaction to touch [18Azañón E. Stenner M.-P. Cardini F. Haggard P. Dynamic tuning of tactile localization to body posture.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 512-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar]. On the contrary, Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] propose that when explicit continuous localization is not needed, for instance to report or move the touched limb, tactile processing can abstract away from topographic representations (somatotopic or external), and use bodily related categories relevant to the task itself. This raises a potentially interesting analogy to studies in vision which have argued for two distinct systems for spatial representation, one based on precise spatial coordinates, the other based on categorical spatial relations [19Kosslyn S.M. You can play 20 questions with nature and win: categorical versus coordinate spatial relations as a case study.Neuropsychologia. 2006; 44: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar]. A question that remains to be answered, however, is under which circumstances touch relies on categorical versus coordinate spatial relations. For example, the so-called 'crossed-hands deficit', in which the ability to tell which of the hands was touched first is impaired when the hands are crossed, has been widely-used as an experimental model of tactile localisation in external space [20Yamamoto S. Kitazawa S. Reversal of subjective temporal order due to arm crossing.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar]. The results of Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar], however, raise the possibility that the deficit may not result from the precise coding of touch in continuous external space, but from an incorrect assignment of touch to a particular limb. The results of Badde et al. [7Badde S. Röder B. Heed T. Feeling a touch to the hand on the foot.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar] raise fundamental questions about our experience of touch. The immediacy of tactile experience has sometimes led touch to be thought of as privileged among senses and even infallible, as in Bishop Berkeley's famous claim that \"touch tutors vision\". By documenting novel ways in which touch goes wrong, this paper shows that we may need to think twice when we feel an insect land on our arm, or we may swat the wrong limb entirely. Good news if you're a mosquito. Feeling a Touch to the Hand on the FootBadde et al.Current BiologyApril 4, 2019In BriefBadde et al. find that healthy adults misattribute touch across hands and feet. These misattributions replicate across five experiments, and modeling links them to perceptual, rather than decision-making, processes. Error patterns reveal that humans disregard the position of a touch in space and use anatomical information when identifying a touched limb. Full-Text PDF Open Archive",

      "abstract": "So much human (and, probably, animal) cognition proceeds against a background of consciousness. Yet the latter remains poorly characterised. As a result, how cognitive functions are related to consciousness remain uncertain. A fundamental problem may be a misunderstanding about the nature of the environmental conditions in which they evolved - sets of independent, recurring 'factors' (the standard Darwinian assumption); or more complex changing conditions of 'constantly novel' experiences. This paper shows how the latter formed the basic biophysics of the origins of life, suggesting a new characterisation of consciousness and cognition. That bio-logic then affords a clear and continuous evolutionary pathway to subsequent, more complex, forms. It is illustrated, here, through different levels from single cell metabolics, through early social forms, developmental processes, physiology and brain functions, to its dazzling manifestation in human socio-cognition.",

      "abstract": "our country India consists of very high population. Almost 9 millions of population in this world can be counted as a deaf or dumb people or both. We all know that the most valuable gift from the god given to human is the capability to watch, hear, spoke &amp; to give response as per the situation arises. We all know communication is one of the most important medium through which one may carve up his/her feelings or express the information to others. The key points in communication are ability of listening and speak the word but so many from us are unlucky because they are not gifted by this ability from the god these are deaf &amp; dumb and people. Now a days so many researches are going on to solve difficulties of these people of our society because they had to face very hard to communicate with normal person. It is too hard for mute(deaf &amp; dumb) people to transmit their information to the normal people. As all normal people are not fully trained to understand different sign lingo, the communication between these two types of people becomes too complex. At the time emergency or other days whenever a mute (Deaf &amp; Dumb) people are travelling passing a message (data) becomes too hard. Due to this disability one that has hearing and speaking disability doesn’t want to stand and face the race with normal person. Since the communication for the mute people is image (Visibility), not acoustic (Audio). For these mute people Hand motion plays a very part for communication. The data transmission between mute-deaf &amp; normal people is always a very challenging job. Deaf people make use of sign language or gestures to make understand what he/she trying to say but it is impossible to understand by hearing people. The admittance to various communication based technologies plays an essential role for these (mute) handicapped peoples. Developing a small and compressed gadget for these mute people is a difficult task. Deaf-Dumb people find a difficulty in communicating with normal people and hence they always stay apart in their societies. Basically deaf-dumb ones uses various sign language for communication, &amp; they always face lots of difficulty while communicating with normal people because they all not able to understand sign language every time. Hence there is always a hurdle in communication between these two type of peoples. There are so many researches has done in regulate to search a simple and easy way for mute people to communicate with the normal people and articulate themselves to the rest of the real world. So many improvements have been done in sign language but all are based on American gesture (sign) Language. Our research work is purely designed to provide an aid to this deaf-mute by developing and designing a smart communication module which will help to renovate sign language to text &amp; speech communication with other and to help them lead a life in a much better way. Our paper represents a static gesture recognition algorithm that will be designed and implemented will be used in the smart communication system to bridge the communication gap between deaf &amp; dumb and normal people. If the algorithm is implemented completely it can be can be also used to capture and analyze emotions of the people in area where high security is desired.",

      "abstract": "OF THESIS BODY PART STRUCTURE KNOWLEDGE IN INFANCY Human faces, bodies, and hands convey critical social information (e.g., emotions, goals, and desires). Infants, like adults, are sensitive to such social information. Unlike infants’ knowledge of the structure of the human face and body, not much is known about infants’ knowledge of hands and feet. The current study tested infants for their preference between intact hand images and ones in which the same hands were distorted (i.e., location of at least one finger was altered to distort the typical structure of the hand). Infants at 3.5 months of age had a preference for the reorganized hand image, demonstrating that 3.5-month-olds have sufficient knowledge of the configural properties of hands to discriminate between intact versus distorted images. Furthermore, when the same images were inverted, infants displayed no such preference, indicating that infants were not relying solely on low-level features to detect differences between intact versus reorganized hands. Contrastingly, when shown images of intact and reorganized feet, even 9-month-olds did not exhibit evidence of sensitivity to structural disruptions in images of feet. These results indicate that infants’ structural knowledge of hands, but not necessarily feet, develops along the same trajectory as their knowledge of faces and bodies.",

      "title": "Just Like an Animal",
      "abstract": "In ethics, comparisons between animals and cognitively disabled humans are sometimes taken to motivate animal rights. The arguments tend to suggest that because there are no morally significant differences between humans with some cognitive disabilities and animals, it is inconsistent to award a special moral status to the former but not the latter. This argument for moral patienthood simply groups cognitively disabled people with animals, and while one might want to defend obligations toward animals, such arguments come at the cost of regarding disabled people as persons. Todd Lekan uses William James's work to suggest that there are morally significant reasons to question this grouping. Lekan emphasizes the salience James gives identity-forming relationships in accounting for moral significance. First, disabled persons and cognitively \"typical\" individuals form many different intersubjective relationships that are not reducible or perfectly analogous to human–animal relationships. Second, Lekan directs attention to intrasubjective, self-to-self, relationships between one's \"abled/independent\" self and one's \"disabled/dependent\" self. Attending to these kinds of relationships allows a response to the argument from marginal cases. More pointedly, it discloses various forms of marginalization. For instance, people who regard themselves as cognitively \"normal\" and thus independent might be disregarding their own dependence, reifying barriers between themselves and cognitively disabled people.",

      "title": "The Psychology Of Acquisitiveness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human and nonhuman animals share an adaptive capacity to plan for the future by acquiring and saving important items, such as food to survive long, cold winters. In addition, humans amass material goods well beyond what they appear to need—a tendency that we refer to as “acquisitiveness.” The current chapter frames our view of acquisitiveness as a typical, human phenomenon that exists across individuals to varying degrees, from a “Spartan” desire to avoid excess possessions or clutter, through normal levels of acquisition, up through the excessive acquisition and retention observed in hoarding disorder. Acquisitiveness is adaptive at most levels but shares features in common with the excessive hoarding of clinical populations including hoarding disorder, OCD, frontal lobe syndrome, and eating disorders. Acquisitiveness appears to derive from multiple underlying instincts, including the tendency to hold on to goods that are needed in the future, the desire to display one’s quality to mates and social partners, and the “nesting instinct” to surround oneself with materials that afford a feeling of security. We summarize this framework and our own work on the phenomenon. Acquisitiveness is an important and ubiquitous human behavior that reflects adaptive instincts, which can nevertheless negatively impact personal finances, emotional well-being, and the environment in ways that we need to understand.",

      "abstract": "The intention of this article is to contribute to the understanding of play as a dialogue. This recognises both the human creator potential and the collective character of human existence. The argument is developed through a phenomenological approach based chiefly on Merleau-Ponty's ideas about habit and expressivity, together with a consideration of the relevance of authors such as Huizinga, Gadamer and Buber. According to Merleau-Ponty 'habit' is not repetition, but always presents something new which makes the border between what is acquired and what is created uncertain. The innovatory character of the habit is connected with our expressive potential. In order to go beyond our historicity we need more than we can find in ourselves. We need 'the Other', not necessarily another person, but a question. During play the Other's movements and responses are questions to us. Our corporeality is called upon by the world to represent itself and in order to continue playing we need to be expressive. However, the dialogue carried out through play can create conflicts that cannot be suppressed or avoided. One of the possibilities presented by play is the recognition of our ability to adopt different perspectives and to create new kinds of relationship with the Other.",

In the latter chapter the issue is whether every complex action is (identical with) some basic action of willed bodily movement. In this chapter, the preliminary issue is whether every complex action at least ‘involves’ (in some way or other) some willed bodily movement by the actor. Discussed are three classes of cases: first, cases where there are bodily movements causative of some harm, but these movements are not willed; second, cases where there is no apparent bodily movement but there is agency (in mental acts and in intentional omissions) and there is an apparent causal connection (sometimes reconstrued to be only a relation of counterfactual dependence) between that agency and some real world harm; and third, cases where there is neither willing nor bodily movement, as in states of a person and unintentional omissions. The conclusion reached about all such cases is that there is human action only when there is a willed bodily movement.",

      "abstract": "Trust is diverse both in value and location. As a relational good, it calls attention to the attributes of truster and trusted. It may be understood as a precondition of human cooperation and a distinct policy available in specific circumstances. Trust may be inspired by the speaker or the speech, by character or action; as a feature of public institutions whose rules are open to alteration, trust may be construed as an artifact, a device that human beings can control and adjust to changing needs and demands. Trust may be a conditional value, justifying praise only on specific occasions, or it may express an unqualified trustworthiness signifying fidelity or mutual faithfulness. Love, an exclusive loyalty or affection, may make trust blind; equally, trust can attract trust in return. Hobbes takes an uncompromising view of these ambiguities and equivocations. To the man who thinks himself confident of the trustworthiness of others, he asks “what opinion he has of his fellow-subjects, when he rides armed; of his fellow citizens, when he locks his doors; and of his children, and servants, when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words?”",

While the former is not well supported by research, cross-cultural research affirms the latter. This chapter uses Tinbergen’s Four Questions to understand grief. Tinbergen’s questions explore two levels of proximate causation: ontogeny and immediate mechanisms such as learning; two additional levels describe evolutionary or more distal explanations: phylogenetic and evolutionary (functional) causation. Developmentally, behavioral characteristics of grief change over the human life span. Immediate causation for feeling grief is found in heightened autonomic nervous system arousal, and environmental inputs, such as degree of relatedness with the one lost. Phylogenetically, grief likely evolved in social species, such as humans and other primates, elephants, and domesticated dogs. Functionally, grief may be a byproduct of attachment; however, grief may serve other functions, such as encouraging protective parenting and compelling relatives to comfort the bereaved. Clinical applications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic plenisentient interrelation of agent and world is specified in kinaesthetic terms. Kinaes-thetic activity, with its temporal-spatial-energic qualities, is always affectively-laden, and through the formation of intercorporeal resonances, the activity necessitates enkinaesthetic entwining with those agents with whom, and those objects with which, we are in relations of perpetual community. I will argue that the capacity for enkinaesthetic dialogue is an a priori nomological condition for agency and the generation of a felt anticipatory dynamics both within and between agents.\r\n\r\nEnkinaesthesia emphasizes not just the neuromuscular dynamics of the agent, that is, the givenness and ownership of its experience but also the entwined, blended and situated co-affective feeling of the presence of the other (agential and non-agential alike) and, where appropriate, the enkinaesthetically anticipated arc of the other’s action or movement, including, again where appropriate, the other’s intentionality. The ‘other’ can be sensing and experiencing agents and it is their affective intentional reciprocity, their folding, enfolding and unfolding, which co-constitutes the conscious relation and the experientially recursive temporal dynamics that lead to the formation and maintenance of integral enkinaesthetic structures and melodies. Such deeply felt enkinaesthetic melodies emphasise the dia- logical nature of the feeling of being as the feeling of being-with or being-among, and demonstrate the paucity of individuating notions that treat agents as singular.\r\n\r\nEnkinaesthesia, as the openness to and reception of myriad subtle multi-drectional cues in dialogical relations, provides grounds for saying, following Heidegger, that it is this which constitutes the pri- mordial mood of care for human relationships and the deep roots of morality. If this is the case, then we might think of it as composing an ‘ethiosphere’ consistent with the semiosphere and the biosphere as presented by Hoffmeyer [1995 and 2008].",

      "abstract": "The consideration in detail of how the drawbacks of imagery are surmounted demands a special study which would take us beyond the limits of our present discussion. But if we keep within the indications of the experiments, it would seem as if there must be some kind of supplementary relation between word and image formation… There is a very general agreement that thinking and the use of language are closely connected, though nobody is justified in reducing the one to the other. In one important respect, words and sensorial images are alike; both act as signs indicating something else which need not be perceptually present at the moment. Thus they are both instruments of the general function of dealing with situations or objects at a distance. Words have the obvious additional advantage of being social, and they constitute the most direct manner of communicating meaning. The image, to be communicated, has itself to be expressed in words, and we have seen that this can often be done only in a most halting and inadequate manner. Words differ from images in another even more important respect: they can indicate the qualitative and relational features of a situation in their general aspect just as directly as, and perhaps even more satisfactorily than, they can describe its peculiar individuality. This is, in fact, what gives language its intimate relation to thought processes. For thinking, in the proper psychological sense, is never the mere reinstatement of some suitable past situation produced by a crossing of interests, but is the utilisation of the past in the solution of difficulties set by the present.

      "title": "Ethics Askew: A Case Study Of Ethics In An Educational Environment",
      "abstract": "For a formal definition of ethics, Webster’s New World Dictionary (1995) defines the term as “the study of standards of conduct and moral judgment”. Ethics is important to individuals because we are concerned with what leaders do and who they are—their conduct and character. “Conduct” is a word that implies behavior. Behavior can change under differing circumstances. For instance, in a “low key”, unstressed situation, most individuals tend to be civil and polite; however, the introduction of stress factored into a scenario can totally change the dynamics of the situation, as well as the ability of those involved to “cope”. Stress can cause individuals to become hostile, rebellious, and oftentimes uncompromising. Stress introduced into a situation can also cause individuals to become unethical. For example, take natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 whereby individuals were under tremendous stress of discomfort from not having a clean environment in which to live, as well as conditions of hunger and thirst from lack of food and fresh water. Most of us have witnessed the television footage of the “looting” that occurred from these conditions. Or take the civil unrest that occurred in the streets of Los Angeles after the verdict of 1992 when police officers were acquitted of the beating of an African American named Rodney King. Again, anger and stress caused looting and violence to erupt in the streets. While these are “extreme” situations, the question arises as to how individuals cope with stress in an atmosphere where civility is taught and encouraged. For instance, consider a classroom situation where an assignment to produce an outcome is given with few rules, and the members of the group are from other classes, possibly even in other states. The means of communication for these individuals are e-mail, a relatively new virtual reality website, similar to face book, or telephone should one choose to use that method. This type of situation would most likely exist in a graduate program and in fact, did. This paper is a case study of just that type of situation.",

The concept of control as espoused by the behavioral tradition became less clearly discernable as I reflected on changes in my lifestyles and ideals, the relationship between politics and behavior modification, and \"the other worlds of non-ordinary reality \". A reference to events beyond our individual efforts-the \"enlarge- ment\"-is imperative if we are to understand the present frame with any clear focus. Essentially, the notion that one human being controls another, or any aspect of the environment, becomes mcreasmgly meanmgless as the enlargement grows further from the experimental laboratory Moreover, a failure to perceive this may reveal an ego- centrism that is potentially hazardous not only to our interpersonal relationships, but to our ultimate connection with all life",

      "title": "From Individual Insecurity to Collective Security",
      "abstract": "Individuals are predestined to die, but human groups may persevere for millennia. Because individual humans are inferior to other animals in many physical aspects such as size, strength, speed, and senses, the human ability to coalesce in large and efficient groups has provided humans with an evolutionary advantage. Consequently, humans have been motivated to perpetuate the existence of groups that safeguard their own existence. From this group survival motivation, I draw three hypotheses pertaining to inter- and intra-group relations: First, group survival, not intergroup relations, is the main force driving group behavior. Intergroup conflict resolution interventions that fail to consider implications for group survival may inadvertently compromise group safety by reducing vigilance to collective threats. Second, the memory of collective victimization, often depicted as an obstacle to intergroup conflict resolution, may have group survival advantages in the sense of \"once burned, twice cautious.\" Third, ideological polemics within a group that often seem negative and disruptive may function as a system of checks and balances between different strategies that serve group survival needs. Because the perception of threats and opportunities is contingent on political affiliation, groups that are ideologically diverse may have an advantage in perceiving threats and seizing opportunities. In this chapter, I present research supporting these hypotheses and show how the group survival perspective may help understand burning social issues, from the obstinate nature of intergroup conflict to the strengths and vulnerabilities of liberal democracies.",

      "title": "Address of Col. Garrick Mallery, U. S. Army",
      "abstract": "It may be conceded that after man had all his present faculties, he did not choose between the adoption of voice and gesture, and never with those faculties, was in a state where the one was used, to the absolute exclusion of the other. The epoch, however, to which our speculations relate is that in which he had not reached the present symmetric development of his intellect and of his bodily organs, and the inquiry is: Which mode of communication was earliest adopted to his single wants and informed intelligence? With the voice he could imitate distinctively but few sounds of nature, while with gesture he could exhibit actions, motions, positions, forms, dimensions, directions and distances, with their derivations and analogues. It would seem from this unequal division of capacity that oral speech remained rudimentary long after gesture had become an efficient mode of communication. With due allowance for all purely imitative sounds, and for the spontaneous action of vocal organs under excitement, it appears that the connection between ideas and words is only to be explained by a compact between speaker and hearer which supposes the existence of a prior mode of communication. This was probably by gesture. At least we may accept it as a clew leading out of the labyrinth of philological confusion, and regulating the immemorial quest of man's primitive speech.",

      "title": "The Laws of the Unspoken: Silence and Secrecy",
      "abstract": "Of silence, paradoxically, one can only speak. By virtue of the alliance that unites reason and language, the capacity to name and to address indeed obeys a certain desire to restrain excessive communication. Laughter, tears and silence are part of the expressive world: however, they attest to the impossible pitfall of words in the socializing function that we accord them. Of extreme sociality, of meaning that exceeds the bearable, the suitability and the commerce of ideas, the only thing that rises to the surface of the perceptible is that emotional logic whose significations shatter every criterion of certitude and of truth on the real. Confronted with three forms of experience of the unspeakable, we ordinarily allow ourselves to lend credit to the spontaneity of the first two (laughter and tears), while the symbolic dimension of silence seems to derive from an invisible orchestration, from a rather simple calculation or from a more elaborate strategy. This difference in nature is essential, and no one would dream of equating what “can” not be said with what “should” not be said. Silence exists as a sort of constraint, interiorized at various levels of the personality, and thereby more social than psychological. Even the involuntary silence of the unknowing person can be codified: as a disciplined avowal or the politeness of the humble who neither tolerates nor imagines any escape from his embarrassment. If speech is born in the abandon of a burst of expressivity, in hilarity or in sobs, it expires in a law, no less severe than the one which endows phrases with semantic coherence. Such a rule thus manifests a universal character socially more affirmed than the multiple syntaxes that organize each linguistic patrimony. That muteness can also be subject to a particular form of apprenticeship shows how each process of socialization determines the price of the communicable and assigns a value to the unformulated. Without pretending to offer a strict typology of this phenomenon, I will distinguish five classes that are capable of comprising its collective aspects.",

It tries to identify a limited set of acting positions - Vertreter, Stellvertreter and personal acting. The theoretical point concerning these acting positions is that each demand a stable set of acts, and work from different logics. This stability is unmoved by such things as changes in the identity or in the preferences of the actor. The actor must subordinate himself under the logic of the position if he is to be able to co-operate with other actors. The Stellvertreter acts in another’s name, alieno nomine agere, while the Vertreter answers for another’s acts. In many situations, an actor may act as the one or the other - the priest acts in the name of God and answers for the acts of the church, which is problematic since the two may be opposed, even antagonistic, to each other.",

      "abstract": "T HE TITLE of this paper represents a small subdivision of one of the subtlest problems in the field of sociology, namely, the nature of the symbolic mechanisms through which man deals to an increasing degree with his universe. These mechanisms consist of neuro-muscular sets of some kind in the human organism. When these sets, namely our verbal mechanisms, correspond closely to the conditions to which we must adjust, they greatly facilitate our adjustments. For example, a map is a highly valuable symbolic representation provided its pattern, order, and sequences correspond to the actual terrain over which we must travel.' It is a corresponding handicap, if it fails to indicate where the rivers and the mountains are, if it confuses the order in which they occur, or otherwise fails to correspond to the conditions to which we must adjust. Sometimes a local map which may be adequate for most kinds of travel within its own borders turns out to be very misleading in the light of a larger perspective. In the same way the verbal systems and orientations of a primitive primary group society may turn out to be grossly inadequate in a national or world society of secondary group relationships. The best illustration of this phenomenon is the successive intellectual revolutions that mark the epochs of science. Each resulted from the difficulty of forcing increasingly adequate observations into the then existing verbal schemes. The new orientations, such as those of Copernicus, Newton, and Einstein, provided a more adequate intellectual chart according to which mental operations could proceed without contradicting the concrete observations of life. As Poincare says: All the scientist creates in a fact is the language in which he enunciates it.12 Now social psychology is the branch of sociology which is increasingly concerned with the linguistic behavior of man. The present paper deals with one type of this linguistic be-",

      "abstract": "Wandering is often one of the first symptoms that gets an individual living in the community into trouble, or puts him or her in danger. Wandering is a single-minded determination to walk that is unresponsive to persuasion. The behavioural definition distinguishes between wandering with risk and wandering as nuisance, as well as interpreting walking as wandering if the behaviour is to excess, even though there is no risk or disturbance to others. Separation anxiety motivates those with dementia to cling to this other person, or if the person with dementia is removed to another setting in order to give their family respite from the suffocating pressure of being trailed, they will attempt to leave so they may seek the whereabouts of those significant others. A person with dementia may become confused in an attempt to find somebody who or something that is unobtainable because it resides in their past.",

      "abstract": "Temporality underpins how living systems coordinate and function. Unlike measures that use mathematical conventions, lived temporalities grant functional cohesion to organisms-in-the-world. In foxtail grasses, for example, self-maintenance meshes endogenous processes with exogenous rhythms. In embrained animals, temporalities can contribute to learning. And cowbirds coordinate in a soundscape that includes conspecifics: social learning allows them to connect copulating with past events such that females exert 'long-distance' control over male singing. Using Howard Pattee's work, we compare the foxtail's self-maintenance, gender-based cowbird learning and how humans manage multi-scalar activity. We argue that, while all living things coordinate, temporal ranging is typical of vertebrates. As primates, humans too use temporal ranging - they can draw on social learning, anticipate winter and manage coordinated action. However language behaviour (or languaging) grants new control over the scales of time. People connect the impersonal to lived experience in narratives, as they draw on autobiography and enact cultural practices. Humans become singular individuals who use temporal experience to manage affect, relationships, beliefs, fictions, and knowledge. Individual subjectivity permits collaborative and competitive activity based on linking events with quite different histories. As a result, alone of the vertebrates, we claim that humans become time-rangers.",

      "abstract": "THREE views of the relation between religion and magic have been and are widely held: that magic is a degraded form of religion; that it is the parent of religion; and that the two are independent, mutually unrelated systems. These views appear to rest partly on too restricted an historical survey, partly on arbitrary definitions of terms, and partly on incorrect interpretations of religious phenomena. It is assumed that a refined conception of the relation between man and the deity existed from the outset; or that there is in religion an impure idea which cannot be explained except as the product of a low initial magical form of thought; or that religion as a friendly relation with the deity and magic as a hostile relation are mutually exclusive; or that magical procedures have always been regarded by primitive peoples as lying outside the sphere of religion; or that the continuous growth of culture would be impossible without an initial and persistent sense of friendship between man and the deity. The opposing theories are sometimes stated thus: if religion, in our sense of the term, had not existed from the beginning, it could never have existed at all; or, if religion had existed from the beginning, magic could never have existed at all.' It is very doubtful whether such hard-and-fast dividing lines can be assumed for early stages of religion. In the beginning everything seems to have been in flux-there were no sharp definitions of natural and supernatural, of gods and demons, or, in general, of friendly and unfriendly Powers.",

We argue that it constitutes a collaborative way of performing sensorial experiences. Examples include producing cries with others' strain or pain and parents sounding an mmm of gustatory pleasure on their infant's behalf. Vocal sounds, their loudness, and duration are specifically deployed for instructing bodily experiences during novices' real-time performance of various activities, such as tasting food for the first time or straining during a Pilates exercise. Vocalizations that are indexically tied to the body provide immediate displays of understanding and empathy that may be explicated further through lexicon. The existence of this practice challenges the conceptualization of communication as a transfer of information from an individual agent – even regarding assumedly individual body sensations – instead providing evidence of the joint nature of action and supporting dialogic theories of communication, including when language-marginal vocalizations are used.",

Therefore any system which could perform as well as we do on this task would incorporate much knowledge about affective faculties, and would probably have embedded within it a model human which would possess affective faculties. However, this would not necessarily manifest itself directly in the embedding system's behavior; thus the embedding system, unlike the embedded one, need not have affective faculties.

      "title": "How the Conflation Of 'Inappropriate' Grief With Guilt Compromises The Sixth Amendment Right To Fair Trial",
      "abstract": "On an imperfect American criminal legal landscape, evidence about a defendant’s inability to appropriately perform grief about and/or towards a victim often colors how judges, juries, and the public understand their relationship to criminality. It is on this imperfect American criminal legal landscape that the subject of this paper—grief performance and its relationship to constructions of guilt—is born.I argue that a real ritual dissonance transpires when an individual loses someone close to them to a traumatizing form of death—that is, in an extremely violent or unexpected way. On the one hand, one’s body finds itself expected to conform to social norms regarding grief and mourning. On the other, one’s experience is so anomalous as to potentially make it unfathomable for them to do so. The resulting grief performance is one that is at once produced by the grieving self to process incomprehensible trauma and recognized by a perceiving community as a social oddity, a ritualized failure incapable of being understood by the surrounding community. Because the community cannot comprehend the griever’s performance, suspicion begins to surround the griever. People begin to realize, “she did not cry”; “she was cold”; “she did cartwheels”; “she spoke on television”; “she spent exorbitant amounts of money,” and so they assume she must have had a hand in orchestrating the death of the person close to her. This process can be understood as creating a “grief-guilt” complex, as improper grief performance produces and generates presuppositions of a person’s guilt.As I demonstrate, the construction of a grief-guilt complex does not live in isolation—if it did, the isolated phenomenon would be theoretically interesting but pragmatically insignificant. Instead, the criminal legal system absorbs the assumptions that a person who performs inappropriate or non-normative grief must necessarily be guilty of a crime. To precisely demonstrate the ways in which this unfolds, I focus on three high profile cases: Amanda Knox, Pamela Smart, and Erik and Lyle Menendez. My analysis draws on the language and affective displays that unfolded in the trials to demonstrate how the grief-guilt complex enters into the courtroom. It also highlights the ways in which media coverage preceding and surrounding the trials helped breed heightened suspicion around each of the defendants in ways that hampered their ability to fully access their Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial unimpeded by prejudicial biases about grief performance and guilt.",

Complex systems dynamics resulting from the dynamic interplay of 'average' processes and 'non-average' detail have been used to explore how the author can model and understand the evolution of human systems. Stochastic processes, ignorance of the future, and differing opinions lead to exploration and discovery which change the system and result in new ignorance of the future and new differing opinions. In human systems ignorance permits learning, but learning creates new ignorance. More generally non-average behaviour generates adaptation which in its turn generates new non-average behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Just like other baby apes, human infants make it their business to stay in safe contact with their caregivers. The difference is that humans do this not just by holding on for dear life, but by ensuring their caregivers are in psychological contact with them. To this end, many of the most important communicative developments take place within the first two years of life. In this chapter we will review how physical mutual responsiveness gives way to the back-and-forth of proto-conversation, where caregivers respond to hiccups, coos and sneezes as if they were speech. Infants discover that they can make sounds and gestures in order to engage others and take turns. They become able to make demands of people, bring things to their attention and ask questions of them. Once they have mastered doing so non-verbally, they soon learn that they can use words for the same purposes (even though they don’t understand words as intersubjectively agreed symbols until sometime later). These communicative developments far outstrip those of any other animal on the planet. And yet it seems that it is precisely the relatively slow development of human infants that affords our species unique mode of communication. Newborns, equipped with a desire to be with others and some basic attentional preferences, are set up to learn from their social environment and thereby guarantee their entry into human culture.",

S. MacColl, and Mr. Roger Fry.This perhaps is why the historical and inductive method offers most attractions.Here the dai^er is of confounding coincidence with causal connection.Another mistake too often committed is to compare the character of the art of any age with the general character of that age as estimated from all its activities, including the artistic : and it would be surprising if such comparison did not yield resemblances.It is dangers such as these which must excuse my putting certain general considerations before you as a preliminary to historic treatment of my subject.IN dealing with any art, and certainly with the plastic arts, two elements have to be distinguished : what I may call the stibject matter of the artist, and his imagination.By subject matter I mean the nature and character of the material which he uses for creative purposes ; by imagination, the spirit, the method, in which he deals with this material.Broadly the artistic imagination is of two types, which may be conveniently described as the Classic and the Romantic, or, to adapt ^ D. S. MacCoU's vivid terminology, Olympian, and Titan.",

Medicinal remedies and accompanying rituals not only treat illness but give protection against misfortune or assist in business, dance and romance. Any serious therapy means cult membership for life. The simplest magical recipe envisages experiential transformation by working on a both sensory (receptive) and emotional (expressive) level. First, each recipe specializes in sensory modes such as the visual, tactile or olfactory. Secondly, the magical ingredients convey meanings, in clear analogy with prefixes and suffixes composing Bantu words. The meanings inhere the physical objects with a particular emotional quality or 'code' affecting the participants. Sensory modes, I thus argue, are crosscut by experiential codes. Vision is not by definition intrusive (as in ocularcentric science); it can be seductive or comforting. I discuss how Chwezi initiation manages to shift codes, from intrusive possession to synchronous mediumship. Participants learn to supplement the classic exteroceptive, proprioceptive and interoceptive senses with what could be called an 'ulteroceptive' sense, where states of the world enter the spirit-medium. Here perception and emotion become one. More common forms of ulteroception remind of 'gut feelings'. They take place in the individual's stomach and liver, registering respectively happiness and conflict in the clan.",

      "abstract": "There has been continuing awareness and concern that alcohol is a drug capable of impairing ability to receive information, to process it in timely and appropriate fashion and to make timely and appropriate responses. One, however, cannot talk about impairment within a vacuum, but rather within the context of the question, impairment for what? It is not enough to say that a car crashed because the driver was impaired by alcohol. Equally important is the following question: If the driver was so impaired and had been so impaired for the past several miles during which the driver had been maneuvering the vehicle, why was there no crash until now? One possibility is that the crash at this moment, as opposed to a previous moment, was simply a random event. Another possibility is that the task became sufficiently more demanding at this moment so that the driver--despite no difference in physiological or psychological level of impairment--was no longer able to cope effectively with data input and processing or in response to the results of those two components of function. It is equally unsatisfactory simply to say that the task became too demanding for a driver impaired by alcohol. One must know which of the several possible components of task demand became excessive and why. Some of these unexplored issues are the subject of the first part of this paper. The second part examines research questions concerning human-environmental interactions during the crash or injury phase.",

      "title": "Эмоционально обонятельный язык бессознательных коммуникаций в процессе человеческого общения",
      "abstract": "The paper analyses phenomenon of the exchange of emotions in human communication. It is emphasized that the exchange of emotions is one of the basic components of all kinds of human communication. It is proved that the exchange of emotions occurs at three levels: conscious level by means of words, at extramental level by means of nonverbal communication (looks, gestures, etc.), and at unconscious level by means of the olfactory channel. We come out with the assumption of existence of emotionally olfactory language as the mechanism of an exchange of emotions at unconscious level. Transfer is deemed as unconscious as firstly the person does not understand the emotions transferred by means of smells, but they influence mood of the person. Secondly, the smells that contain the information on emotions are very weak, they are not perceived as aromas. Thirdly, such transfer does not occur on the level of consciousness. It is supposed that each of the basic emotions is connected with a specific base odour; when the person feels this emotion his/her physiological reactions are launched, these reactions are compatible with corresponding base odour. In turn, the base aroma which is separated from the human organism causes the same basic emotion in other people. Specific interrelations «emotion a smell» are offered. We assert that the similar mechanism can cause such phenomena as a mass panic, etc. Complex feelings also can be made of a combination of basic emotions, and are then transferred by means of combinations of the basic smells to the interlocutor. Such phenomenon of human psyche as empathy can be based on this transfer.",

Such possible beings would deserve moral consideration similar to that of human beings. Our duties to them would not be appreciably reduced by the fact that they are non-human, nor by the fact that they owe their existence to us. Indeed, if they owe their existence to us, we would likely have additional moral obligations to them that we don’t ordinarily owe to human strangers – obligations similar to those of parent to child or god to creature. Given our moral obligations to such AIs, two principles for ethical AI design recommend themselves: (1) design AIs that tend to provoke reactions from users that accurately reflect the AIs’ real moral status, and (2) avoid designing AIs whose moral status is unclear. Since human moral intuition and moral theory evolved and developed in contexts without AI, those intuitions and theories might break down or become destabilized when confronted with the wide range of weird minds that AI design might make possible.

      "abstract": "Proxemics is usually of interest to architects and designers because it emphasizes the concept that spatial distance is a \"silent language\" through which men unwittingly convey attitudes, feelings, and judgments about their fellows. Proxemics represents one of several such out-of-awareness systems which fall within the general rubric of paracommunication. For the American non-contact group, and possibly for others as well, four distance sets seem to encompass most, if not all, behavior in which more than one person is involved. These are referred to as intimate, casual-personal, social-consultative and public. Each distance set is characterized by a close and a far phase. Vocalization at intimate distances plays a very minor part in the communications process, which is carried mainly by other channels. The boundary line between the far phase of the casual-personal distance and the close phase of social-consultative distance marks, in the words of one subject, \"the limit of domination.\".",

      "title": "Brokerage",
      "abstract": "In its most basic terms, brokerage refers to the mechanism whereby an actor acts as an intermediary between two other actors that are not directly linked, thus creating a new line of communication and exchange. This premise has been shared widely across the social sciences, yet with different twists and emphases. On the one hand, some views of brokerage stress in particular the profits incurring to those occupying intermediate positions from their specific structural location. Filling “structural holes” enables some actors to secure privileged access to scarce resources (e.g. information or advice), as well as to affect other actors' behavior through network‐based mechanisms of dependence. One well‐known instance of this dynamic is given by the so‐called role of the tertium gaudens , who secures gains precisely by virtue of his/her capacity to play one of the other partners in the relation against the other. Another view of brokerage underlines first and foremost brokers' ability to bridge different social milieus and different cultures. Although the presence of personal interest aside other motives can never be ruled out, here the main emphasis is on the collective, rather than the individual, consequences of brokerage: for example, brokers are perceived as crucial to the emergence of new collective actors. This is the notion of brokerage that most social movement analysts primarily refer to, without necessarily pitching them explicitly one against the other.",

The wave-like pattern of the adaptive process is an expression of the dialectic law of unity and struggle of opposites; in this case, unity and struggle of construction and destruction, maintaining continuous self-reproduction and self-preservation of a living system in its environment.

For instance, exposure to rightward motion can make a static input seem to drift leftward—the motion aftereffect. Such aftereffects have been integral to building our understanding of the neural mechanisms and computational processes that underlie perception. Increasingly complex characteristics have been found to be susceptible to visual aftereffects, such as the appearance of human faces, the apparent number of visual elements, and the glossiness of a surface. Here we report that the apparent elasticity, or squishiness, of an object is also subject to a visual aftereffect. This relationship can explain data previously interpreted in terms of a causality aftereffect.",

While the first type may eventually convert to a typical peaceful experience, the relationship of all three types to prototypical near-death experiences merits further study. The effect of the distressing experience in the lives of individuals deserves exploration, as the psychological impact may be profound and long-lasting.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many objects that we encounter have ‘typical’ material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft, and jell-O dessert is wobbly. Over a lifetime of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is, but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when pulled apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object’s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes “pulled” towards the “native” motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in response time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance.",

Wherever historical or comparative information exists and phylogenetic inferences are possible, descent and modification from some pre-existing behavior or structure, either a signal functioning in another context or manner or a simple inadvertent cue, is usually indicated (e.g., Kessel 1955). Such origins and modifications may indicate that signal evolution is an economical process. They may also serve as a reminder that signals seldom arise in vacuo but tend to form in the presence of, and in response to, a perceptual background. It is assumed that perception of an earlier signal was already well developed, and when signals descend from cues, they may usually evolve either in response to pre-existing perception of the cues or coevolve alongside it.",

Without the certainties of the past, how could one know what a proper life looked like? How was one to live? What was one to do? In a manner akin to the modern Jew responding to the prevailing trends in Western philosophy by rejecting the demand that the particular yield before the universal, contemporary virtue ethics is an approach to the ethical life that considers the dominant ethical theories of modernity and responds, in effect, “these are not enough. These do not understand the depth of the moral life and they are powerless to answer how to live a morally rich life.” Where the modern Jew negotiated a way of maintaining particularity while participating in the universal, the virtue ethicist attempts to find a way to respond to the demands that ethics be somehow universally applicable while recognizing the essential embeddedness of the virtues and ethics themselves. Virtue ethics, which demands that we consider the question of how one should live before we attempt to evaluate the morality of a given action or attempt to choose how to act when facing a moral dilemma, draws our attention to the rupture in the moral certainties at the point when Jewish tradition encounters modernity.",

Are there ways of living that could heal past violence without involving further violence to bring them into being? What might a harmonious yet diverse community look like? How might apparently individual and passive activities such as dreaming and meditating help to create and sustain such realities? How does a just society deal with conflict and build consensus? We address these questions by comparing two novels: Dorothy Bryant’s The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You and Starhawk’s The Fifth Sacred Thing. Both loosely express an eco‐feminist sensibility. In both, non‐hierarchical societies serve as stewards of nature and its resources rather than as dominating or exploitative powers. Each community grounds itself in values and practices historically deemed feminine, particularly evidenced in attitudes towards reason and coercion. In each book, humans produce nature‐cultures through careful practices of self‐making involving close attention to transcendent messages. Finally, both novelists imagine their communities as marginalized by and at risk from the larger world. In the end, however, they not only survive threats but even transform those most resistant to their values.",

      "abstract": "This article explains the evolution of capacity for learning a language in the human species. Several essential cognitive capacities had to be developed before language could even begin. First, language rests on a rich conceptual system. One must be able to perceive patterns in the objects and events around in order to learn a word or to use. One must learn arbitrary associations between vocalizations or gestures and concepts to understand or to use even isolated words. A typical word in any human language that is used today is a conventional three-way association between a meaning, a distinctive sound sequence and a characteristic set of syntactic roles. The ability to make arbitrary associations between meanings and either sound or gestures is not quite limited to human beings. When coached by humans, dogs can learn to respond to several hand signals or spoken commands, and apes can do much better than dogs, but no animal can learn words with the voracious ease of human beings. Language must have begun with the ability to associate gestures or vocalizations with concepts, and to use these vocalizations or gestures as a means of sharing our concepts with others. The brains have evolved over the years to store a huge number of words.",

      "title": "Evidence of Multiple Personality Disorder in Handwriting",
      "abstract": "orensic handwriting identification links the handwriting of an unknown document with a suspected author in cases involving forged checks, credit card charge slips, anonymous letters, and ransom notes. It is also used to determine the genuineness of someone’s signature on documents such as wills, contracts, and trusts. This type of testimony has been accepted in state and federal courts for over 100 years. The individuality in our handwriting, which allows it to be identified with us is caused by a number of factors: the schools we attended; our parents; our sense of neatness; the size of our hands, fingers, and arms; and our eyesight. All of these factors make handwriting a product of the brain: neurological transmissions come through the arms and fingers to impart uniqueness into our handwriting. The material for this article originates from a medical malpractice case examined by the author in which a dispute arose regarding when the plaintiff acquired multiple personality disorder (MPD), an ‘‘abnormal condition in which two or more well developed personalities exist within the same individual. Awareness of the others among the various personalities may not occur. Each may take over at a certain time. Change from one to another is usually sudden and linked to stress.’’ Mosby Medical Encyclopedia. My role was to examine diaries authored by the plaintiff from 1986‐1991 and determine if evidence existed of different writers. The original diaries were used for the analysis. All parties agreed that the diaries and entries were prepared on their respective dates so the possibility that they were all made at one time after the filing of the lawsuit was not an issue. Consequently, no ink dating tests were performed. The examination consisted of comparing the handwriting habits in the diaries with each other to determine if they were consistent, inconsistent, contrived, or if evidence of different authors was present. The results were startling. Most of us see differences in our handwriting from day to day, which can be caused by haste, writing position, fatigue, stress, or writing surface. In these diary entries, which appeared under different names, were four distinct handwriting styles. They presented not only pictorial differences, but the writing systems themselves",

      "title": "Audience, Uglossia, and CONLANG",
      "abstract": "Could we also imagine a language in which a person could write down or give vocal expression to his inner experiences -- his feelings, moods, and the rest -- for his private use? Well, can't we do so in our ordinary language? -- But that is not what I mean. The individual words of this language are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to his immediate private sensations. So another person cannot understand the language. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations par. 243 I will be using 'audience' in two ways in the following essay: as a phenomenon that produces and is produced by media technologies (readers, hearers, viewers, Internet-users), and as something, audiens, that is essential to language itself, something without which language cannot be. I shall do so in specific references to invented languages. Who, then, are the 'consumers' of invented languages? In referring to invented languages, I am not talking about speakers of Esperanto or Occidental; I am not concerned with the invention of international auxiliary languages. These projects, already well-debated, have roots that go back at least as far as the 17th-century language philosophers who were at pains to undo the damage of Babel and restore a common language to the world. While Esperanto never became what it intended to be, it at least has readers and speakers. I am also not even talking about speakers of Klingon or Quenya. These privately invented languages have had the good fortune to be attached to popular invented cultures, and to media with enough money and publicity to generate a multitude of fans. Rather, I am talking about a phenomenon on the Internet and in a well- populated listserv whereby a number of people from all over the globe have discovered each other on-line. They all have a passion for what Jeffrey Schnapp calls uglossia ('no-language', after utopia, 'no-place'). Umberto Eco calls it 'technical insanity' or glottomania. Linguist Marina Yaguello calls language inventors fous du langage ('language lunatics') in her book of the same title. Jeffrey Henning prefers the term 'model language' in his on-line newsletter: 'miniaturized versions that provide the essence of something'. On CONLANG, people call themselves conlangers (from 'constructed language') and what they do conlanging. By forming this list, they have created a media audience for themselves, in the first sense of the term, and also literally in the second sense, as a number of them are setting up soundbytes on their elaborately illustrated and explicated Webpages. Originally devoted to advocates for international auxiliary languages, CONLANG started out about eight years ago, and as members joined who were less interested in the politics than in the hobby of language invention, the list has become almost solely the domain of the latter, whereas the 'auxlangers', as they are called, have moved to another list. An important distinguishing feature of 'conlangers' is that, unlike the 'auxlangers', there is no sustained hope that their languages will have a wide-body of hearers or users. They may wish it, but they do not advocate for it, and as a consequence their languages are free to be a lot weirder, whereas the auxlangs tend to strive for regularity and useability. CONLANG is populated by highschool, college, and graduate students; linguists; computer programmers; housewives; librarians; professors; and other users worldwide. The old debate about whether the Internet has become the 'global village' that Marshall McLuhan predicted, or whether it threatens to atomise communication 'into ever smaller worlds where enthusiasms mutate into obsessions', as Jeff Salamon warns, seems especially relevant to a study of CONLANG whose members indulge in an invention that by its very nature excludes the casual listener-in. And yet the audio-visual capacities of the Internet, along with its speed and efficiency of communication, have made it the ideal forum for conlangers. Prior to the Web, how were fellow inventors to know that others were doing -- in secret? J.R.R. Tolkien has been lauded as a rare exception in the world of invention, but would his elaborate linguistic creations have become so famous had he not published The Lord of the Rings and its Appendix? Poignantly, he tells in \"A Secret Vice\" about accidentally overhearing another army recruit say aloud: 'Yes! I think I shall express the accusative by a prefix!'. Obviously, silent others besides Tolkien were inventing languages, but they did not have the means provided by the Internet to discover one another except by chance. Tolkien speaks of the 'shyness' and 'shame' attached to this pursuit, where 'higher developments are locked in secret places'. It can win no prizes, he says, nor make birthday presents for aunts. His choice of title (\"A Secret Vice\") echoes a Victorian phrase for the closet, and conlangers have frequently compared conlanging to homosexuality, both being what conservative opinion expects one to grow out of after puberty. The number of gay men on the list has been wondered at as more than coincidental. In a survey I conducted in October 1998, many of the contributors to CONLANG felt that the list put them in touch with an audience that provided them with intellectual and emotional feedback. Their interests were misunderstood by parents, spouses, lovers, and employers alike, and had to be kept under wraps. Most of those I surveyed said that they had been inventing a language well before they had heard of the list; that they had conceived of what they were doing as unique or peculiar, until discovery of CONLANG; and that other people's Websites astounded them with the pervasive fascination of this pursuit. There are two ways to look at it: conlanging, as Henning writes, may be as common and as humanly creative as any kind of model-making, i.e., dollhouses, model trains, role-playing, or even the constructed cultures with city plans and maps in fantasy novels such as Terry Pratchett's Discworld. The Web is merely a means to bring enthusiasts together. Or it may provide a site that, with the impetus of competition and showmanship, encourages inutile and obsessive activity. Take your pick. From Hildegard von Bingen's Lingua Ignota to Dante's Inferno and the babbling Nimrod to John Dee's Enochian and on, invented languages have smacked of religious ecstacy, necromancy, pathology, and the demonic. Twin speech, or 'pathological idioglossia', was dramatised by Jodie Foster in Nell. Hannah Green's 'Language of Yr' was the invention of her schizophrenic protagonist in I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. Language itself is the centre of furious theoretical debate. Despite the inventive 'deformities' it is put to in poetry, punning, jest, singing, and lying, human language, our most 'natural' of technologies, is a social machine, used by multitudes and expected to get things done. It is expected of language that it be understood and that it have not only hearers but also answerers. All human production is founded on this assumption. A language without an audience of other speakers is no language. 'Why aren't you concentrating on real languages?' continues to be the most stinging criticism. Audience is essential to Wittgenstein's remark quoted at the beginning of this essay. Wittgenstein posits his 'private languages theory' as a kind of impossibility: all natural languages, because they exist by consensus, can only refer to private experience externally. Hence, a truly private language, devoted to naming 'feelings and moods' which the subject has never heard about or shared with others, is impossible among socialised speakers who are called upon to define subjective experience in public terms. His is a critique of solipsism, a charge often directed at language inventors. But very few conlangers that I have encountered are making private languages in Wittgenstein's sense, because most of them are interested in investing their private words with public meaning, even when they are doing it privately. For them, it is audience, deeply desireable, that has been impossible until now. Writing well before the development of CONLANG, Yaguello takes the stance that inventing a language is an act of madness. 'Just look at the lunatic in love with language', she writes: sitting in his book-lined study, he collects great piles of information, he collates and classifies it, he makes lists and fills card indexes. He is in the clutches of a denominatory delirium, of a taxonomic madness. He has to name everything, but before being able to name, he has to recognize and classify concepts, to enclose the whole Universe in a system of notation: produce enumerations, hierarchies, and paradigms. She is of course describing John Wilkins, whose Real Character and Universal Language in 1668 was an attempt to make each syllable of his every invented word denote its placement in a logical scheme of classification. 'A lunatic ambition', Yaguello pronounces, because it missed the essential quality of language: that its signs are arbitrary, practical, and changeable, so as to admit neologism and cultural difference. But Yaguello denounces auxiliary language makers in general as amateurs 'in love with language and with languages, and ignorant of the science of language'. Her example of 'feminine' invention comes from Helene Smith, the medium who claimed to be channeling Martian (badly disguised French). One conlanger noted that Yaguello's chapter entitled 'In Defence of Natural Languages' reminded him of the US Federal 'Defense of Marriage Act', whereby the institution of heterosexual marriage is 'defended' from homosexual marriage. Let homosexuals marry or lunatics invent language, and both marriage and English (or French) will come crashing to the ground. Schnapp praises Yaguello's work for being the most comprehensive examination of the phenomenon to date, but neither he nor she addresses linguist Suzette Haden Elgin's creative work on Láadan, a language designed for women, or even Quenya or Klingon -- languages that have acquired at least an audience of readers. Schnapp is less condemnatory than Yaguello, and interested in seeing language inventors as the 'philologists of imaginary worlds', 'nos semblables, nos frères, nos soeurs' -- after all. Like Yaguello, he is given to some generalities: imaginary languages are 'infantile': 'the result is always [my emphasis] an \"impoverishment\" of the natural languages in question: reduced to a limited set of open vowels [he means \"open syllables\"], prone to syllabic reduplication and to excessive syntactical parallelisms and symmetries'. To be sure, conlangs will never replicate the detail and history of a real language, but to call them 'impoverishments of the natural languages' seems as strange as calling dollhouses 'impoverishments of actual houses'. Why this perception of threat or diminishment? The critical, academic \"audience\" for language invention has come largely from non-language inventors and it is woefully uninformed. It is this audience that conlangers dislike the most: the outsiders who cannot understand what they are doing and who belittle it. The field, then, is open to re-examination, and the recent phenomenon of conlanging is evidence that the art of inventing languages is neither lunatic nor infantile. But if one is not Tolkien or a linguist supported by the fans of Star Trek, how does one justify the worthwhile nature of one's art? Is it even art if it has an audience of one ... its artist? Conlanging remains a highly specialised and technical pursuit that is, in the end, deeply subjective. Model builders and map-makers can expect their consumers to enjoy their products without having to participate in the minutia of their building. Not so the conlanger, whose consumer must internalise it, and who must understand and absorb complex linguistic concepts. It is different in the world of music. The Cocteau Twins, Bobby McFerrin in his Circle Songs, Lisa Gerrard in Duality, and the new group Ekova in Heaven's Dust all use 'nonsense' words set to music -- either to make songs that sound like exotic languages or to convey a kind of melodic glossolalia. Knowing the words is not important to their hearers, but few conlangers yet have that outlet, and must rely on text and graphs to give a sense of their language's structure. To this end, then, these are unheard, unaudienced languages, existing mostly on screen. A few conlangers have set their languages to music and recorded them. What they are doing, however, is decidedly different from the extempore of McFerrin. Their words mean something, and are carefully worked out lexically and grammatically. So What Are These Conlangs Like? On CONLANG and their links to Websites you will find information on almost every kind of no-language imaginable. Some sites are text only; some are lavishly illustrated, like the pages for Denden, or they feature a huge inventory of RealAudio and MP3 files, like The Kolagian Languages, or the songs of Teonaht. Some have elaborate scripts that the newest developments in fontography have been able to showcase. Some, like Tokana and Amman-Iar, are the result of decades of work and are immensely sophisticated. Valdyan has a Website with almost as much information about the 'conculture' as the conlang. Many are a posteriori languages, that is, variations on natural languages, like Brithenig (a mixture of the features of Brythonic and Romance languages); others are a priori -- starting from scratch -- like Elet Anta. Many conlangers strive to make their languages as different from European paradigms as possible. If imaginary languages are bricolages, as Schnapp writes, then conlangers are now looking to Tagalog, Basque, Georgian, Malagasay, and Aztec for ideas, instead of to Welsh, Finnish, and Hebrew, languages Tolkien drew upon for his Elvish. \"Ergative\" and \"trigger\" languages are often preferred to the \"nominative\" languages of Europe. Some people invent for sheer intellectual challenge; others for the beauty and sensuality of combining new and privately meaningful sounds. There are many calls for translation exercises, one of the most popular being 'The Tower of Babel' (Genesis 10: 1-9). The most recent innovation, and one that not only showcases these languages in all their variety but provides an incentive to learn another conlanger's conlang, is the Translation Relay Game: someone writes a short poem or composition in his or her language and sends it with linguistic information to someone else, who sends a translation with directions to the next in line all the way around again, like playing 'telephone'. The permutations that the Valdyan Starling Song went through give good evidence that these languages are not just relexes, or codes, of natural languages, but have their own linguistic, cultural, and poetic parameters of expression. They differ from real languages in one important respect that has bearing on my remarks about audience: very few conlangers have mastered their languages in the way one masters a native tongue. These creations are more like artefacts (several have compared it to poetry) than they are like languages. One does not live in a dollhouse. One does not normally think or speak in one's conlang, much less speak to another, except through a laborious process of translation. It remains to a longer cultural and sociolinguistic study (underway) to tease out the possibilities and problems of conlanging: why it is done, what does it satisfy, why so few women do it, what are its demographics, or whether it can be turned to pedagogical use in a 'hands-on', high- participation study of language. In this respect, CONLANG is one of the 'coolest' of on-line media. Only time will show what direction conlanging and attitudes towards it will take as the Internet becomes more powerful and widely used. Will the Internet democratise, and eventually make banal, a pursuit that has until now been painted with the romantic brush of lunacy and secrecy? (You can currently download LangMaker, invented by Jeff Henning, to help you construct your own language.) Or will it do the opposite and make language and linguistics -- so often avoided by students or reduced in university programs -- inventive and cutting edge? (The inventor of Tokana has used in-class language invention as a means to study language typology.) Now that we have it, the Internet at least provides conlangers with a place to hang their logodaedalic tapestries, and the technology for some of them to be heard. References Von Bingen, Hildegard.

      "title": "Understanding Natural Cause: Children's Explanations of How Objects and Their Properties Originate",
      "abstract": "An understanding of natural cause includes the realization that events can occur independently of human activity or intentions. It also often entails realizing that causal mechanisms can be nonobservable or nonobvious. The present research investigated to what extent children ages 4-7 have developed a concept of natural cause. Study 1 examined children's understandings of object origins (e.g., how the sun began); Study 2 probed children's causal understandings of object behaviors and properties (e.g., why rabbits hop and have long ears). In both studies, children by age 4 were sensitive to the natural kind-artifact distinction in their explanations. They mentioned human intervention for human-made artifacts but rarely for naturally occurring things. Moreover, subjects at all ages were able to identify specific kinds of natural cause, including intrinsic causes (such as growth) and inborn nature. Finally, subjects understood the link between nonobvious, internal parts and self-generated activity (e.g., that bones are important for the flight of a bird). Altogether, these results suggest that even preschool children realize that natural causes exist. They contradict Piaget's characterization of young children as artificialistic (believing that naturally occurring things are created by people) and as focused on observable properties.",

      "abstract": "Are you wearing clothes from Nike, H&M or Esprit? Tongue, eyebrow or bellybutton piercing? Tattoos on the upper arm, shoulder or lower back? Image is so important, and not only nowadays. Identity has always used the body as its primary source of reference. Today, there are possibilities available to each individual through MUDs (multiuser dungeons or multiuser dimensions) with their avatars in 3D Internet simulations to create their identity. The individual personality is not only staged though outward appearances (e.g. clothes), material goods (e.g. cell phones, furniture, cars), and social behaviour, but also their presence and activities within virtual spaces. Generally, the environment of MUDs are dubious, from a ethical or moral point of view, for developing personality since there is no bridge existing between physical body and identity. Still, it is possible for avatars to play a positive role in developing individual personality and social behaviour if a bridge is built within the self-designed hybrid (virtual and physical) experience and activity space. This theory is supported by the result of the ArtDeCom project, which combines theory and practice of integrated arts, design, and computer science in education.",

      "abstract": "In many complex systems, we observe that `interesting behaviour' is often the consequence of a system exploiting the existence of an Information Bottleneck (IB). These bottlenecks can occur at different scales, between individuals or components of a system, and sometimes within individuals themselves. Oftentimes, we regard these bottlenecks negatively; as merely the limitations of the individual's physiology and something that ought to be overcome when designing and implementing artificial systems. However, we suggest instead that IBs may serve a purpose beyond merely providing a minimally-viable channel for coordination in collective systems. More specifically, we suggest that interesting or novel behaviour occurs when the individuals in a system are constrained or limited in their ability to share information and must discover novel ways to exploit existing mechanisms, which are inherently bottlenecked, rather than circumventing or otherwise avoiding those mechanisms entirely.",

      "title": "The Mind-Body Problem: View Outside of the Subject-Object Opposition",
      "abstract": "The solution of the mind-body problem as the problem of interrelation and interconditionality of mental and physiological faces contradictions when one proceeds from the classical subject-object opposition.Accepting the subject-object opposition only as the convenient way for a scientist to speak about the phenomena of this world (the way that shouldn't be equal to the world itself), it is already senseless to look for the reason of a mental event neither in biology nor in sociality.The subject-object opposition itself is possible, because the event of proportionality of human being and world have happened.In this event the human being and the world are defined by a finite way and until it neither the human being, nor the world can't be defined.The human physiology (as well as a sociality which is sometimes unfairly identified with spirituality) can be considered as a marker of such definiteness, it is minimum of the being of consciousness.However in addition to this minimum there is also another aspect.Indeed, in every act of perception two events are realized simultaneously (not in a sequence): perception of a certain seeming (what is possible if human being and world are already defined, i.e. the act of proportionality of human being and world have happened) and a certain content.The content is always related to a certain idea.Ideas, in its turn, can be subdivided into two classes.To the first we will attribute the ideas which are the result of generalization of preceding experience and which give an opportunity to speak in an ordered way about the phenomena of the surrounding world.But there are also ideas of another sort -those that give an opportunity to the human being to newly re-create himself each time in the complete and ordered state.These ideas organize human life as human one, they are initiated by culture, but they are not a result of generalization.Such are a conscience, good, moral, love and the similar phenomena for which there are no external reasons -here the basis of a phenomenon coincide with the phenomenon itself.So, human physiology (including work of human brain) is the only side which characterizes the minimum of life of consciousness, it is the marker of human being and world are defined now.We are always after this definiteness (or, more precisely, inside it) when we perceive events of the world, and one shouldn't search the conditions of any event of life of consciousness (the point of interests of ontology) neither in biology nor in sociality.Every conscious act is complete and self-sufficient, and the consciousness basis (being actually the basis of human being) can be found only in consciousness.",

There might be a successful plea that this influence is more real than is supposed, necessary to men if human dignity is to be upheld; such is not here advanced; but rather one or two practical questions, modestly constructed, are submitted with deference, as : Is not the vague, unnamed, very real relation between man and his inanimate correspondent subject to all the varieties and discriminations allowed to ‘taste’? Again, in discourse of this matter the word beauty must sooner or later be used; very well, but man is beautiful, though this is only a memory. Regrettez vous le temps oh le ciel sur la terre marchait et respirait dans un peuple de dieux? The little we can say at present is : man might harmonize with the created beauty external to himself; but the fact is that his presence is seldom tolerable and yery rarely acceptable. Shrinking, he has lost a function; he is reduced to a spectator, and can no longer be wedded to bosquet and glade except in spirit, Walt Whitman’s endeavours and other’s non-obstant. It is by chance that man and his are not feyesorrow, distraction, hindrance, scandal, discord among the elements where he might have wonted place. That the scandalgiver is man sometimes seems to justify impatience and abandonment of the enterprise; but to close our eyes is to relinquish our only true external inheritance, and that is the last sacrifice.

These two images argue that a linear presentation might be misleading and forewarn against what are too loosely called the lessons of history. The concept of disability is construed as a form of interactivity between various factors, and evolutive and dynamic forms of interactiveness. The model for disability can only be regarded as systemic. Infirmity found itself on the side of the irrational. Infirmity played a major role in a growing awareness and consideration of the overriding need for social solidarity. Infirmity is the broken mirror of one's positive self-image. Facing infirmity, individual and group alike feel ill at ease, afraid, tend to shy away from misery and deviance, and are confronted by the finitude and fragility of their condition.

      "title": "Life in time - the missing temporal dimension in autopoiesis.",
      "abstract": "There is a widespread view in the artificial life community that life is not so much about materiality but about organization. However, one of the favourite candidate theories that explain what this organization should be like has an ambivalent position with respect to materiality. This is the theory or autopoiesis (Maturana and Varela, 1980, Autopoiesis and cognition, D. Reidel). Accordingly, autopoiesis is the self-production of a unity in the domain of processes of material construction, transformation and destruction. The identity of the living system, in this view, is sustained in its form in spite (or rather because) of its material flux. This notion seems to imply an inherent temporal dimension to autopoiesis. It is, intuitively, a dynamical concept. However, because of its insistence on a set-theoretic focus on conservation of autopoiesis, the theory says little about the temporality of life (leaving relevant phenomena such as stress, fatigue, pathologies and development untouched). Efforts have been made to bring thermodynamic material constraints into the theory of autopoiesis (RuizMirazo and Moreno, 2004, Artificial Life, 10, p. 235). The implications are not trivial, nor are they foreseen in the theory as postulated in the original literature and interpreted purely in formal terms. One immediate consequence of realising autopoietic organizations in dissipative physical structures far from equilibrium is that there is an obvious time arrow introduced into the process of life: the arrow of thermodynamics. Bare autopoiesis, paradoxically, does not present us with a similar time arrow (a time-reversal thought experiment leads to this conclusion). But this temporality belongs to the nature of dissipative processes and is in some sense only inherited by life because such material processes constitute it. I shall argue that living systems enjoy a different kind of temporality, given by their own interactive and teleological organization. This temporality is richer and different from that of the background time’s arrow — it is a consequence of expanding the theory of bare autopoiesis with the notion of adaptivity, (Di Paolo, 2005, Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, 4, p. 429). This temporality is characterized by intentional direction, minimal granularity, rhythmicity, and the presence of historical transitions (in behaviour and development). It belongs to the organization of an adaptive autopoietic system under precarious circumstances. It is conceivable that this temporality could emerge even if the system were not subject to thermodynamical constraints since it is a consequence of the higher order relations between interactive and constitutive aspects of self-maintenance. It is also conceivable for aspects of the temporality of life to contradict the temporality of the thermodynamics time’s arrow, since the temporality of life is inherently related to its intentionality. Even at a minimal level, a living system may retroactively alter the virtual possibilities of the past through its sense-making activity in the present.",

      "title": "On the Counterfactual Dimension of Negative Liberty",
      "abstract": "This article explores some implications of the counterfactual aspect of freedom and unfreedom. Because actions can be unprevented even if they are not undertaken, and conversely because actions can be prevented even if they are not attempted and are thus not overtly thwarted, any adequate account of negative liberty must ponder numerous counterfactual chains of events. Each person's freedom or unfreedom is affected not only by what others in fact do, but also by what they are disposed to do. Their dispositions play a key role in determining whether the abilities and inabilities of each person would continue as such if the person's conduct or situation were altered in various respects. Until one knows whether people would or would not have acted in certain ways if a given person had sought to do something, one cannot know whether that person was free to do that thing. Nor can one know whether the person was free to perform that action in combination with manifold subsequent actions. Thus, whether tacit or explicit, counterfactual scenarios are indispensable for any enquiry into a person's liberty. By relying (albeit perhaps only implicitly) on such scenarios, which trace how people are disposed to act vis-a-vis one another, one takes account of the central role of unmanifested dispositions in setting the bounds of people's sociopolitical freedom. Among the principal theorists whose work is critically examined in this article are Hillel Steiner, Ian Carter, and G.A. Cohen.",

Misalnya, ketika seekor kucing mengeong, dia sedang berkomunikasi dengan teman-temannya atau lingkungannya. Begitu juga ketika seorang siswa berteriak di depan kelas, dia sedang menyampaikan sesuatu kepada temannya atau orang-orang di sekitarnya. Karena itu, sebenarnya suara kucing dan teriakan siswa adalah bentuk komunikasi, karena keduanya mengandung pesan yang hendak disampaikan. Tetapi suara kucing tidak bisa disebut sebagai bahasa. Sedangkan teriakan siswa disebut bahasa. Karena itu, bisa dikatakan seekor kucing bersuara, sedangkan seorang siswa berbahasa.\r\n\r\nBenar bahwa sebagian hewan memiliki kemampuan membentuk simbol untuk menyampaikan pesan atau makna, bahkan pemikiran dan emosi. Seperti simpanse oleh para peneliti disebut sebagai hewan dengan kecerdasan tinggi, tetapi ia tetap tidak bisa berbicara, dan karena itu peradabannya tidak pernah berkembang sejak keberadaannya puluhan juta tahun lalu hingga sekarang. Menurut Slamet Iman Santoso (dalam Suriasumantri, 1983: 226) kemajuan peradaban manusia terjadi karena pemikiran konseptual yang dinyatakan dalam bahasa kemudian pelaksanaan konsep-konsep yang telah dinyatakan dalam bahasa. Pelaksanaan menjadi suatu hasil ini dinilai. Rangkaian inilah yang mendasari kemajuan manusia.",

      "title": "Modelling Spatio-Temporal Interactions for Compositional Action Recognition",
      "abstract": "Humans have the natural ability to recognize actions even if the objects involved in the action or the background are changed. Humans can abstract away the action from the appearance of the objects and their context which is referred to as compositionality of actions. Compositional action recognition deals with imparting human-like compositional generalization abilities to action-recognition models. In this regard, extracting the interactions between humans and objects forms the basis of compositional understanding. These interactions are not affected by the appearance biases of the objects or the context. But the context provides additional cues about the interactions between things and stuff. Hence we need to infuse context into the human-object interactions for compositional action recognition. To this end, we first design a spatial-temporal interaction encoder that captures the human-object (things) interactions. The encoder learns the spatio-temporal interaction tokens disentangled from the background context. The interaction tokens are then infused with contextual information from the video tokens to model the interactions between things and stuff. The final context-infused spatio-temporal interaction tokens are used for compositional action recognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach on the compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-art result of 83.8% top-1 accuracy outperforming recent important object-centric methods by a significant margin. Our approach of explicit human-object-stuff interaction modeling is effective even for standard action recognition datasets such as Something-Something-V2 and Epic-Kitchens-100 where we obtain comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Listening is a behaviour, it is also an attitude implying for the subject a disposition and receptiveness of the body, as well as a sustained attention of the mind, concerned with logic and coherence, but also stimulated, provoked and motivated by a form of affectivity which is inevitably more unpredictable. These behaviours give evidence to the explicit hypothesis of the other as distinct from the self, and also as the source of intentionalities and abilities (needs, desires, plans, rationality). From these meanings, listening implies thinking. We can then represent it either in terms of procedures (how to create, obtain, establish, maintain, optimize, show the accurate attitude) – these procedures then become techniques, tools or methods – or in terms of process (what do we feel through such psychic moves ?) The processes develop in a temporality which provides their slow elaboration and maturation in obeying a more biological than mechanical future, whereas the procedures are more elaborate, rational, technical, modelized and segmented, thus more spatialized. The former are ways of acting, the latter are ways of existing. Of course these forms of representation seem heterogeneous, translating very different ways of seeing the world and very different philosophies. They can even claim to be antagonistic, which roughly corresponds to the classical distinction between Homo faber and Homo sapiens. The former is, at least partly, a matter for comprehension, in our acceptation of Dilthey’s terms, whereas the latter is a matter for explanation. The subtle intelligibility of the notion of listening is linked to the distinction between, as well as the contrasted articulation of the two heterogeneous readings.",

The methods of committing: physical violence, which consists in inflicting bodily injuries that can lead to the death of the victim, violation of physical or mental health, damage to his honor and dignity, are considered separately. Psychological violence, which is related to the effect on the psyche of a person through verbal insults or threats, harassment, intimidation, which intentionally causes emotional insecurity, the inability to protect oneself and may cause or is causing damage to mental health; economic violence, which consists in depriving a person of food, clothing and other property or funds to which the victim has a legal right, which can lead to his death, cause a violation of physical or mental health. Traces of domestic violence are considered in a broad sense, namely, traces of struggle: a mess in the room, overturned furniture, broken glass, dishes, scattered clothes, etc. It has been established that the traces of domestic violence can be material and ideal. Ideal traces of domestic violence are formed in the memory of the participants of the criminal event. The types of identified traces are specified in relation to the method of committing the crime. When analyzing the situation of domestic violence, it was established that its structure includes the place and time of the crime, the moral and psychological relations of the subjects of the offense and their environment, the social and psychological environment in which the offender is located and influences his actions, as well as the socio-political situation in the country.",

      "abstract": "Quasi-Reasoning (Thomas Aquinas, Gregory of Rimini, John Duns Scotus)Thomas Aquinas addresses the question of whether or not nonhuman animals reason in connection with the famous example of Chrysippus' dog, which was originally formulated by the Stoic logician of the same name.1 Like most other Stoics, Chrysippus was relatively skeptical about, if not even hostile to, the idea of animal rationality.2His actual intention was not to make a case for the rationality of dogs.Rather, he simply aimed to illustrate a certain type of syllogism, namely, the so-called disjunctive syllogism.And so he told the story of a hunting dog that chases an animal but then loses sight of it and comes to a fork with three paths.Since the dog cannot see where the animal went it sniffs around the first and then around the second path, before finally taking the third way without sniffing.The dog in the example thus seems to employ a syllogism of the form 'The animal took either A or B or C, so if it did not take A or B it must have taken C' .As has been stated, Chrysippus simply took this to be a good illustration of a disjunctive syllogism.However -and quite ironically, one could say -his example became one of the most widespread examples of animal reasoning, especially through the Outlines of Pyrrhonism in which Sextus Empiricus turned this example against the Stoics' denial of animal intelligence and made it a proof of their rationality.3Thomas Aquinas, like many other medieval authors, likely knew this example through writings of the Church fathers, such as Basil of Caesarea's and Ambrose of Milan's Hexaemeron.4But what matters here is not so much how this example was handed on from one generation to the next but rather how 1 On the origin, history, and reception of this example, see Floridi (1997).A recent philosophical analysis and discussion provides Rescorla (2009). 2 On the Stoics' position see Dierauer (1977), 205-238; Sorabji (1993b), 20-28; Steiner (2005), 77-92.",

      "title": "The Doppelgänger Phenomenon and Death: A Peculiar Case of Homicide by a Subject with First-Episode Psychosis",
      "abstract": "The Doppelgänger phenomenon refers to the experience of a direct encounter with one's self, characteriswed by: (i) the perception of a figure with one's own identical physical features; or (ii) the apprehension that the perceived figure shares the same personality and identity. The Doppelgänger does not only look like the same person, it is his/her double. The perceptual element is usually a hallucination, although occasionally a false perception of an actual figure may be involved. This phenomenon has been described in individuals suffering from overwhelming fear, severe anxiety or intoxication, epilepsy, as well as in the sleep-wakefulness transition. It has also been reported in major psychoses. The fear of imminent death often precedes the Doppelgänger experience. This report presents the case of a 30-year-old man, Mr. Y, who was stabbed to death by Mr. X, his \"double\". The aggressor and his victim, although not related, were truly doubles; remarkably, they shared the same name and surname, age, professional activity and place of work. Moreover, they attended the same sports center but barely knew each other. The forensic psychiatric evaluations in Mr. X, subsequent to the crime committed, were suggestive of a psychotic condition. This case is unique in the scientific literature. In the most serious psychotic forms, the issue of the \"double\" calls into question not only the dissociative processes involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disorder, but also bio-psycho-social elements, as well as personal data in this case, which made the victim and the aggressor \"identical\". In the context of psychopathological functioning, the delusional mood (Wahnstimmung) that precedes the development of delirium is a sort of gateway to an impending psychotic illness, involving delusional awareness or mood (atmosphere). In psychosis, splitting is the main issue and this influence is seen as an evil, foreign, apocalyptic and unknown side no longer recognised as belonging to the self even in a physical sense. In such a situation, it is felt that the only way to survive is by suppressing one's double as a defense against disorganisation of the self.",

      "title": "Modern Applications of Hibah in the Light of Shari'ah Objectives of Gift and Donation Contracts (Al-Tabarru'at)",
      "abstract": "TABARRU'AT (GIFTS AND CHARITABLE ACTS) The term tabarru' (pl. tabarru'at) is derived from the root b-r-', meaning excel. For instance, He excelled in knowledge, courage, or other qualities; or excelled his companions in knowledge; or was, or became accomplished; perfect or complete, in every excellence, and in goodness. (1) Tabarru' bil-'ata' means, he gave what was not incumbent or obligatory on him; gave supererogatorily; or gave gratuitously, unasked, or unbidden. The jurists, taking into consideration the basic linguistic meanings and the essence projected by wasiyyah, waqf, hibah, 'ariyah, qard and other similar contracts derive the technical meaning of tabarru' as, contract which extends wealth or its benefit to others, immediately or in the future, without desiring a compensation and with the intention of doing a pious deed (bi qasd al-birr wal-ma'ruf). This definition presents tabarru' contract as the genus and places wassiyah, waqf, and the like as its sub-contracts (anwa'). Tabarru'at, inclusive of its sub-contracts, are acts of piety and charity. (2) This is grounded in Q 5: 2: Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancor: Fear Allah. For Allah is strict in punishment. The Qur'an commentator, al-Jassas al-Razi (d. 369/980) elaborates: The verse enjoins every Muslim to support another in all types of acts which come under piety. (3) Acts of charity that support each other either in kind or cash or in any other form of benefit are part and parcel of piety. Another verse (Q 2:180) states: It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if leave any goods, that make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God-fearing. Even though the verse is specifically on the topic of bequest (wassiyah), it sheds light on the essence of tabarru'at. The verse encourages the dying person to consider his or her parents and next of kin in the spirit of love. The person is advised to allocate certain amount for parents and next of kin from his or her property without asking for anything in return. The spirit in tabarru'at is to share wealth and benefit others because of love and not because of personal gain. Tabarru'at is about caring for each other. Another verse of the Qur'an emphasizes that righteousness is not about performing salutary regulations only, but it is also about caring for each other. With the salutary regulations, a righteous man should strive for love of Allah and the love for his fellow-men: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards east or west; but it is righteousness to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God-fearing. (4) In this verse, extending assistance to kin, orphans, needy, wayfarer, beggars, and slaves are all considered as acts of piety, providing that the assistance rendered should proceed from love and no other motive. Hadiths also shed light on the importance of tabarru'at. Jurists present tahaddu tahhabbu (exchange gifts so that you may love one another) (5) as the principle source on which the legality of Hibah is based. This hadith touches upon the essence of tabarru'at, which is to give gifts to friends and relatives out of love. The legality of tabarru'at is established through consensus as well; the Muslim ummah agree on it to be a pious act. (6) In order to perform acts of tabarru'at as a contract, a Muslim has to deal with its components (arkan). …",

In (1), for example, being drunk and kissing someone are typically interpreted as temporary properties or events which take place in a particular place at a particular time: John was drunk last night in his office, or he kissed Mary on Sunday 13th of May, 2001, at 2:13pm, for exactly 8,56 seconds. Contrastingly, in (2), if one is intelligent or in love, one tends to retain these properties for a relatively long period of time.

      "title": "ELDERLY ALIENATION, SATISFACTION, AND SOCIAL CLASS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Alienation usually refers to certain perceptions and feelings that individuals have about themselves and aspects of their social environment. According to Seeman (1959), alienation is characterized by five symptoms: social isolation (real or perceived), meaninglessness normlessness. powerlessness, and self-estrangement. Alienation is typified more accurately by degree and direction. Social structures and institutions often attribute to the aged feelings of having little if any aontrol over their life situation. Ambivalence and existential meaning loss occur. Frankl (1963), held that man is a spiritual being motivated not by the will to pleasure or the will to power but by the will to meaning. Aged persons find themselves in a state of melancholy where they become desensitized to the inherent values In their own being and subsequently to the values outside themselves. Reisman (1971), maintains>that alienation is genesis of loneliness. He set forth a typology of man as inner-directed and man as outer-directed as a function of the social structure. A social structure imposing direction consists of increased personal mobility, rapid accumulation of capital, technological shifts and constant expansionism. The source of direction for the individual is inner in the sense that it is implanted early in life by the elders and directed towards generalized, inescapable goals. Inner directed persons receive more input to the self with no opportunity for, reciprocity. The other directeGl individual has as its source others on whom s/he depends on for validation and unlike the directed person who is acted upon, ~s engaging in activity. Park's notion (1959), of marginal man emphasizes that while an individual's personality has a physiological makeup, it achieves its final form under the individual conception of self. This conception is determined by the role which society assigns the person, and the attitudes others in society form of him. The aged persons find themselves in a marginal, alienated position. Weiss (1973), has focused on disengagement theory as a descriptive model for alienation. As society has increased in mobility and complexity, individuals are forced to engage and disengage from significant others. This may OCCUr developmentally in terms of age and peer pressure or by formal positioning in a social stratum. The constant shifts in structural definitions reduce the chances for the longevity of relations with others. Alienation and its association to the lower class has been demonstrated in several studies (Faris, Dunham 1960, Hollingshead, & Redlich 1958, Meyers 1959). The elderly person of low socio-economic status not only has been structurally disengaged from society, but if in a lower class has the Iiklihoodof beihg alienated as well. The alienation in terms of magnitude and intensity is higher. Thus mental disorders in the elderly may have to do not with intrinsic personality disorders but rather with structural shifts. Faris and Dunham (1960), found that the elderly residing in the central business districts of lower class status, were more likely to be alienated or isolated and that these factors are thus related to the high rates of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Protest",
      "abstract": "When social movement scholars write about protest, they typically reference protest events occurring in public spaces. These events encompass various types of protest activities such as marches, rallies, demonstrations, pickets, strikes, and vigils, which may occur as stand‐alone activities or in various combinations thereof, such as marching to the site of a rally or demonstration. Inasmuch as such events are often sponsored and organized by an anchoring social movement or coalition of movements, there is little question but that the analysis of protest events is fundamental to understanding aspects of the dynamics and operation of social movements. Yet, it is argued in this entry that the tendency to treat protest and protest events as parallel terms for the same phenomena constricts our understanding of protest in a number of ways. First, most protest events function as the public face of an existing movement or as the upsurge of an underlying animating sentiment pool. Much like the metaphoric tip of an iceberg, protest events generally signify a broader and deeper base of organizational and/or corresponding cognitive and affective support or sentimentality, which are too often overlooked. Second, a research focus on protest events also implies that protest which doesn't congeal into public, collective, embodied protest events rarely merits analytic attention. Thus, by yoking protest to protest events, as if they are the same, the broader character and multidimensionality of protest is glossed over and misconstrued.",

      "title": "Behavioral Regulation of the Milieu Interne in Man and Rat",
      "abstract": "In regulating the internal homeostatic environment mammals, by necessity, employ behavioral strategies that differ from the tactics used in coping with contingencies in the external environment. When an animal consumes a meal, the palatability of that meal is automatically adjusted in accordance with the ultimate internal effects of that meal. If the meal causes toxicosis, the animal acquires an aversion for the taste of the meal; conversely, if recuperation follows ingestion of the meal, the taste of that meal is enhanced. Unlike the learning that occurs when externally referred visual and auditory signals are followed by punishment in the form of peripheral pain or reward in the form of food in the mouth, conditioning to the homeostatic effects of food can occur in a single trial and rarely requires more than three to five trials, even though the ultimate effects of the meal are delayed for hours. Paradoxically, the animal need not be aware of the ultimate internal effect in the same sense that it is aware of external contingencies. For example, an aversion can be acquired even if the animal is unconscious when the agent of illness is administered. Thus, the way in which food-effects are stored in memory may be fundamentally different from the way in which memories of specific time-space strategies devised for external contingencies are stored. This separation of function is indicated by limbic lesions which disrupt conditioning to a buzzer that is followed by shock and facilitate conditioning to a taste that is followed by illness. Operationally speaking, one can describe both aversion conditioning and buzzer-shock conditioning in the space-time associationistic terms of classical conditioning. However, psychologically speaking, one must realize that in aversion conditioning the animal does not act as if it were acquiring an \"if-then\" strategy. It acts as if a hedonic shift, or a change in the incentive value of the flavor were taking place. Such hedonic shifts are critical in regulation of the internal milieu. When an animal is in need of calories, food tends to be more palatable; as the caloric deficit is restored, food becomes less palatable. If the animal's body temperature is below optimum, a warm stimulus applied to the skin is pleasant. When body temperature is too high, the converse is true. In this way, homeostatic states monitored by internal receptors produce changes in the incentive values of external stimuli sensed by the peripheral receptors, and guide feeding behavior. In mammals at least, the gustatory system, which provides sensory control of feeding, sends fibers to the nucleus solitarius. This brainstem relay station also receives fibers from the viscera and the internal monitors of the area postrema. Ascending fibers bifurcate at the level of the pons and project toward the feeding areas of the hypothalamus and the cortex. The olfactory system which primarily projects to the limbic system does not play a primary role in adjusting food incentives. Rather, it plays a secondary role in the activation of feeding, as do other external sensory systems. This specialized conditioning mechanism, which specifically adjusts gustatory hedonic values through delayed visceral feedback, is widespread among animals, including man and rat. These two species are remarkably similar in their thresholds and preferences for gustatory stimuli. The behavioral similarities are based on the animals' having similar gustatory systems, similar convergence of gustatory and internal afferents to the nucleus solitarius, and similar midbrain regulatory mechanisms. Thus, it is not surprising that the feeding of obese rats with internal hypothalamic damage resembles the feeding of obese human beings insensitive to the internal signs of this caloric state. Obviously, man has a highly specialized form of symbolic communication and the rat does not, yet man's cognitive specialization does not prevent him from developing aversions to food consumed before illness even when he knows that his illness was not caused by food.",

This happy state of affairs is, however, not possible for all people. A human life gone berserk is an awesome thing. The very power which elevates man to a level which can be called human can also turn upon him and create utter chaos in his world. If he were not a sensitive human creature, perhaps he could not become psychotic when he finds himself no longer able to cope with the problems confronting him; the fact remains that it is man's inescapable fate to think and to feel so long as he has intact the basic capacity which enables him to do so. If somehow the methods by which he accomplishes this task become entangled, he may lose contact with the reality around him and even destroy himself.",

      "title": "Self-Consciousness and Intersubjectivity",
      "abstract": "NOTHING APPEARS LESS PROBLEMATIC than self-consciousness. Without it, no inquiry seems possible, for how can one seek knowledge unless one is aware of undertaking that quest? Moreover, consciousness of anything other than the self is always plagued with knowing something whose existence cannot lie in the consciousness of it. As Descartes observed, whenever one represents an object different from one's consciousness, it is always doubtful whether that object exists or corresponds with its representation. (1) By contrast, insofar as consciousness of one's self-consciousness is the very being of self-consciousness, the gap between object and representation here seems uniquely absent. Not only is my representation of myself as self-conscious constitutive of my being self-conscious, but nothing prevents that representation from corresponding to what it is about. This privileged certainty, however, generates skepticism regarding knowledge of anything other than one's own consciousness, including other minds. If knowledge of self-conscious is secured by its identity of subject and object, of knowing and what knowing is knowing of, wherever that identity is lacking, cognition confronts the dilemma of bridging a gap that is insurmountable if knowing has no access to its object other than by representing it. The yawning solipsism that attends the privileged self-certainty of self-consciousness is not mitigated by the oft alleged dependence of consciousness upon self-consciousness. To paraphrase Kant, consciousness of any object is possible only if consciousness relates itself to its own representation of the object. Otherwise, the putative knowledge belongs to no one and there is no consciousness of the represented object. If this relation of consciousness to its own representation is self-consciousness, then there can be no consciousness of an object without a simultaneous self-consciousness. (2) The problem with securing this dependency is that the privileged certainty of self-consciousness renders suspect whether consciousness can ever relate to anything but itself. So long as self-consciousness is construed to be primary, it remains doubtful whether there can be any consciousness of a non-self to accompany self-consciousness. The solitary primacy of self-consciousness, however, is just as questionable as is how consciousness can be aware of itself. II To begin with, self-consciousness must presuppose consciousness if to be self-conscious is to be conscious of one's consciousness. In that case, consciousness must be present, relating to an object it distinguishes from itself. Consciousness may always involve self-relation in that consciousness relates to an object only by relating to its own mental content. Nonetheless, in order for this self-relation to involve intentionality, to be about something objective rather than subjective, consciousness must treat its own mental content as the determination of something independently given from which it is disengaged. Without disengaging itself from the same content to which it stands in self-relation, consciousness reverts to a preconscious psyche that feels nothing but its own feeling self, never attaining an opposition of subject and object. For this reason, the relation of consciousness to its own mental content is not equivalent to consciousness of consciousness. Consciousness's relation to its own representation is only part of consciousness, a part that must be accompanied by a relation to that content as something other to consciousness. Accordingly, consciousness does not collapse into self-consciousness. Because mind is enabled to be conscious of something other than itself only by detaching itself from its own mental content, neither self-consciousness nor consciousness can be primary. Just as consciousness depends upon the disengagement by which self-feeling becomes sensation of something objective, so self-consciousness depends upon consciousness as the object of its own disengaged awareness. …",

      "abstract": "THOMAS AQUINAS AND ANALOGY: A TEXTUAL ANALYSIS WHATEVER PARTICULAR claims or assertions a philosopher or philosophical tradition may wish to make, what is unqualifiedly affirmed in the very endeavor of philosophy is inward or mental experience; and \" spoken words are the symbols of mental experience.\" 1 Speech and mental experience or understanding would seem to be inseparable. The philosopher's inquiry into the whole invariably leads, then, to an inquiry into language. By looking directly at whatever presents itself in our familiar world, at things and their properties, at human affairs and actions, we run the risk of being blinded, as do people who observe the sun during an eclipse if they do not look at its image on some watery surface.... To avoid being \" blinded \" Socrates thought he had to \" take refuge in spoken words \" . . . in exchanging questions and answers with himself and with others and in them search for the truth of things.2 Philosophers whose conceptions of human speech and understanding are as divergent as Heidegger's and Aristotle's still concur in the centrality of language for man. Aristotle defines man as a living being possessing speech, and Heidegger asserts that: To be a man is to speak . . . in his profound essence he is a speaker, the speaker. That is his distinction and at the same time his burden. It distinguishes him from stones, plants, animals, but also from gods.3 1 Aristotle, On Interpretation, I. 16\"8, tr. E. M. Edghill, in The Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. Richard McKeon (New York: Random House, 1941). • Jacob Klein, \"Aristotle, An Introduction,\" in Ancients and Modems, ed. Joseph Cropsey (New York: Basic Books, 1964), p. 56. 8 Martin Heidegger, An Introduction to Metaphysics, p. 69. 230 THOMAS AQUINAS AND ANALOGY: A TEXTUAL ANALYSIS ~81 For Aristotle and Aquinas, to \" take refuge in spoken words \" is to take refuge in the power of human language to translate the language of the things themselves and thus to symbolize the mind's experience of the whole. This power of language is, in part, the power of analogous signification. Analogy, briefly, is the dilation of the focus of our meanings and words beyond their original concrete matrix. Without analogy, names would be but serial numbers stamped upon the objects of our experience and designating no more than the sequence in which we encountered them. Embedded so deeply in the fabric of man, analogy, it seems, is a\" mystery\" in the sense of an inexhaustible source of concrete problems. This is to say that analogy itself is analogous, i. e., subject to a variety of formulations all of which bear upon the mysterious issue involved, none of which, however, fully embody it. Our discussion, then, in focusing upon the Thomistic doctrine of analogy, necessarily lays no claim to an explanation of analogy as such but rather seeks only an accurate explication of but one traditional (i.e., the Thomistic) formulation of the problem, or \" mystery \" as we have defined it, of analogy. The Thomistic doctrine of analogy has been handed across the centuries nestled for the most part in the largely unquestioned categories of Thomas's commentator, Cardinal Cajetan, Thomas De Vio (1468-1584). Recently, however, the accuracy and authority of Cajetan's interpretation of Thomas on this point have been as widely disputed as they were once accepted. Therefore it seems that we must initiate our discussion either by validating the position of Cajetan or by prying the Thomistic doctrine free from a regrettable distortion of long standing. In either case we must see what it is that Cajetan maintains Thomas to be saying. Cajetan constructs his interpretation of St. Thomas around an early text in the Commentary· on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (1254-56), which text reads as follows: Something is predicated analogously in three ways. First, it may be predicated according to intention alone and not according to its being (secundum intentionem tantum, et non secundum esse). ROBERT E. MEAGHER This happens when one intention is referred to several things according to a priority and posteriority, and yet this single intention really exists only in one thing. Thus, the intention of health is referred to animal, urine, and...",

      "title": "Stranger Anxiety: When Children Face Strangers",
      "abstract": "Till about seven months, the baby mostly flees from contact with strangers, often avoiding eye-contact without the parent’s awareness. A reaction of resistance and anxiety when approached by a stranger is commonly seen around eight months. In this paper I explore this emotional responding in the context of a novel re-conceptualization of healthy narcissism processing as an emotional immune system. Whereas recent discussions in the literature have focused on the anxiety reaction, I propose that key to understanding this commonplace phenomenon is the understanding of how healthy narcissism works to safeguard that which is familiar and resist that which is strange. The operation of these psychic processes may be likened to those of the biological immune system, which safeguard the familiar codes of the body and repel alien invaders. In safeguarding that which is familiar and repelling the alien, healthy narcissism operates as an emotional immune system. It is promoted by good-enough attachments (object relations) characterized by our being loved the way we are (true self), in separateness and not according to someone else’s blueprint (false self), one that risks invading our familiar self. The more we are loved for who we truly are, our self-integrity is more immune to invaders, and throughout our lifespan, we are more immune to alien influences, and to the incursions of others’ hurtful words and deeds. Healthy narcissism is thus understood as providing, from birth, emotional immunity to our sense of self-familiarity. We come to recognize ourselves and the partners of our various relationships via continually being alerted to and subsequently resisting or rejecting strangers/strangeness (i.e., invaders), and by gradually tolerating and even befriending the otherness. Befriending is possible when we are able to discover some familiarity embedded within the stranger. The appearance of eight-month resistance/anxiety, a normal alertness to strangers, signals that the baby has a rudimentary sense of both self and object constancy and is able to differentiate between his familiar “not-I,” such as the parent/caregiver whom he experiences as familiar and is attached to, and the unfamiliar “not-I” stranger. The parent/caregiver is then experienced as a bridge between that which is familiar and that which is strange and anxiety-provoking/overwhelming. Parents’ reactions to the “not-I” (of their baby) can help the infant differentiate between a “not-I” he might befriend, and one that is best avoided. The normal emotional immune reaction reflects a good-enough balance between preserving the familiar and true self, and befriending the otherness, to which one remains appropriately but not excessively alert.",

Hence, unlike crying, it was not easily shown to be innate. Furthermore its triggers appear to be immaterial. Expression solves the problem of why and when people blush by hypothesizing a reflexive process of reading: I blush because I read you as reading and judging me—my appearance, or conduct. This dynamic of meta-recognition or self-attention requires the construction of a complex theory of human agency, involving: a dual self; the operation of innate sympathy; a physiological hypothesis; and an evolutionary derivation. Meta-recognition underpinned Darwin’s understanding of sexual attraction, group cohesion, and conscience. It also served as a formative influence on later psychologies of symbolic interaction.",

      "title": "The Concept, Models and the Measurement of the “Social System”",
      "abstract": "1. It would be a theoretical presumption to many sociologists and social psychologists that our societies are not formless but have certain organized pattern. But, on the other hand, there would be various possibilities from what theoretical framework those organized pattern should be abstracted. In this paper, let us think on this point that the societies are not formless because of some pattern uniformities, not randomness, in our interpersonal overt behaviors ; the interpersonal behaviors are observable manifest variables, so all constructive concepts of sociology and social psychology can be inferred from them. 2. On the external objective point of view, a concept that is inferred from the more or less consistent order is what we call the “social system.” Against this, on the internal subjective point of view of motivated individuals, a concept that is inferred from pattern uniformities is what we call the “attitude”. Both social system and attitude are the scientific construct inferred from observable manifest valiables of interpersonal behaviors, and they must be distinguished from each other in terms of object-subject criteria. 3. What is called a “system” is as follows : its two or more units or factors are mutually interdependent such that any change in state of one unit or factor xj is followed by change in state of others x1, …, xi-1, Xi+1, …, xn and the latter is followed again by change in the former and so on. Thus, when we apply this to behabioral units or factors we can speak of the social system that shows the relationship within social objects. 4. We find a series of sociological theories which adopt this concept. In the case of classical Pareto's theory, the social system was considered to be a state of dynamic equilibrium in cycles of interdependence of four factors : a. residues ; b. interests ; c. derivations ; d. social heterogeneity and circulation. Closely related to this theory we can find George C. Horman's theory. He defines the social system as composed of two analytical aspects (i.e., external system and internal system) and three composite factors (i.e., activities, interactions, and sentiments). Therefore, these two I shall name “Pareto-Homans model” of the social system. Pareto's is a priori model, but Homans' is, so to call it, ex post facto model for codification. 5. Tolcott Parsons' famous theory of the social system rests on the same basis, yet the main feature that characterizes his theory lies in the categorization in terms of combinations of five (or recently, chiefly four) “pattern variables”. This way of thinking is akin to that of Allen H. Bartons' “property space.” Combinations of pattern variables are not merely setting of typology but indicate the “phase movement” and the role-differentiation in action space. This Theory, putting its empirical. reference to Robert F. Bales' interaction process analysis, I call “Parsons-Bales model, ” which, as attempt to theorize more than is empirically known, can be termed speculative model. 6. Above two models will be both able to be characterized as a kind of model of dynamic equilbrium. This model always needs some a priori theoretical postulates : that is, automatic control mechanism or feedback system. Because of this postulate, if we are to make use of this model to our empirical reality, the problem of conceptual validity will arise. Strongly contrasted to this model would be the concept of “mass” society.",

      "title": "Representing the Absent: A Study of Memorialisation and Its Material Culture in Spontaneous and Official Memorial Places in Contemporary Sweden",
      "abstract": "The general aim of this thesis was to study how memorial places and objects serve as links and meeting points between the bereaved and their conceptions and memories of the departed. This has been examined in several different ways, from various viewpoints, and placed in different contexts and periods in time. The general result is that there are several and complementary ways through which material links appear as parts of memorialisation processes. Places can serve as links and meeting points between the bereaved and their conceptions and memories of the departed by associating to the deceased’s social or private life, such as a favourite restaurant or the home. They can also function by associating to the deceased as dead, such as the burial site in the cemetery, where the dead body is laid to rest, or the site of an unexpected or violent fatality, reminding the bereaved of the fatal accident and the loss of the deceased’s life. In the same way, material objects reminiscent of the deceased as alive, such as a cherished teddy bear or a piece of jewellery, and objects found at the fatal accident site, such as splinters of glass from the crashed car and pebbles or leaves collected there, can serve as material tokens with a special connection to the deceased and function as links between the bereaved and their conceptions and memories of the departed. The thesis contributes to a discussion of the narrative and communicative possibilities of different memorial places and objects as well as their various functions as ritual and symbolic tools in the process of grief and remembrance. Of special interest is how the very physical appearance and placing of a spontaneous memorial can be seen to materialise and locate feelings of grief and loss. For some people, repeated visits to the site of a fatality can be a way of confronting, controlling and taming terrible thoughts of the accident. For others, the sight of a roadside memorial, for example, placed in close proximity to their everyday lives, can lead to unwanted thoughts of death and expose the fragility of life. A roadside memorial on the site of a fatal traffic accident can be perceived by the bereaved and by passing motorists as a manifestation of the dangerous condition of that particular roadway or the threat of careless driving, and thereby also serve as a powerful statement to the road commission and to drivers. In the same way, a spontaneous memorial on the site of a murder can be seen as a material and visual protest against the increasing violence in society. Another important issue is how memorial places, whether the gravesite, a spontaneous memorial or an official monument, serve as sites where we can physically encounter thoughts of the past and the departed as well as continue to care for the deceased by leaving gifts, fresh flowers and lighted candles. Memorial places and objects bring the material world of the here and now into juxtaposition with the transient world of memories of the past. By bridging to the past to support the generation of present memories, memorial places and objects also aid the construction of memories in the future. Recognising the profound role this material culture plays in people’s memories and grieving can be an important asset to the design community. This thesis shows the importance of acknowledging and respecting the need the bereaved may have to see the site of a tragedy, to leave flowers or candles there and to return repeatedly. These and other insights generated by the thesis could be further developed for use in planning and designing gravesites, memorial places and monuments. It calls attention to the phenomenon of spontaneous and informal activities in a city, and illuminates their importance and power – insights that could be used in the planning and design of the urban environment more generally.

      "abstract": "In any organization people may be observed from two different points of view: first of all as organs (or components of organs), in the sense that organizational relationships assign them a precise spatial and temporal placement, they carry out a specialized function in relation to the entire structure, they have a specific functionality that delimits the admissible interactions with the other elements, and they show a particular functioning; secondly , as members of a social collectivity in which, independently of their organizational role and connections, they appear as similar agents , moved by private objectives, capable of producing micro decisions, behaviours and effects relatively analogous to that of the others. My study considers the second aspect of human behaviour in organizations and aims to present a simple theory - the Theory of Combinatory Systems - which may allow us to describe, explain, and to a certain extent control many relevant and intriguing collective phenomena and their observable effects, which are produced by agents acting as unorganized social systems, even if they are also members of an organizational structure. In plain words I define as a combinatory system any collectivity (composed of individuals or organizations) whose agents, consciously or unconsciously, act (exclusively or prevalently) on the basis of global information which they direcly produce and update as the consequence of their micro behaviours. On the one hand, the global information is - or derives from – a synthetic variable whose values are produced by the combination of the micro states of the agents (hence the name Combinatory System ) but, on the other, these values affect the subsequent states as a result of a micro-macro feedback , acting over a period of time, that produces self-organization in the agents’ micro behaviours. If we accept the traditional definition of self-organization as the macro behaviour of a collectivity of agents in which the micro behaviours appear to be “directed”, or “organized”, by an Invisible Hand , or Supreme Authority , in order to produce the emerging phenomenon represented by the formation of ordered structures, of recognizable patterns, then it is easy to recognize that the macro phenomena produced by the macro behaviour of the system become factors in self-organization, since they are interpreted by the agents as information they can base their decisions on. In other words, the invisible hand is nothing other than the synergetic effect of the micro-macro feedback action (or circular causality ) that generates and updates the global information that produces self-organization and emerging macro behaviours attributable to the collectivity.",

      "title": "Thinking of Individuals",
      "abstract": "1. A good deal of our conversations, and, no doubt, of our thinking, is about individuals. As we often talk about Gerald Ford, the moon, the City of New York, and so forth, we frequently think about these and similar things without saying anything. If one asks the question, what makes a particular discourse talk about a certain individual, the answer is simple and straightforward: reference. In the explicit cases at least, the speaker refers to the individual he wishes to talk about by using such well known verbal devices as proper names, definite descriptions, demonstrative phrases, and the like. Hence the tempting idea that in thought, too, the thinker somehow must refer to the thing he is thinking about, and in doing so must employ certain means, which are, as it were, the mental counterparts of the overt media of reference, e.g., names and phrases imagined or subvocally pronounced, mental images evoked, and the like. This view is reinforced by a particular model of thinking, as old as Plato (Theaetetus 189e-190a, Sophist 263e-264a), according to which thinking is nothing but talking to oneself silently. Now I happen to believe, and so argued recently ([5]: 42 ff.), that this view of thinking is mistaken, and, as I am going to show in the first part of this paper, it spectacularly fails with respect to the function of reference. But if I am right, and there is no reference in thought, then we are faced with a problem which has no obvious solution in sight, namely, what is it that makes a particular act of thought thinking about this or that individual person or object.

      "title": "The Meaning of Suffering",
      "abstract": "Abstract People tend to use the word suffering in either of two ways: in a psychological sense, or in what I will call, for want of a better word, an “objectivist” sense. In the “objectivist” sense, suffering is roughly synonymous with calamity or misfortune. In this sense, the precise meaning of suffering remains partly to be filled in, because what counts as calamity or misfortune is somewhat vague and partly subject to dispute. But often enough, calamity is unmistakable. One is murdered; one’s relatives are massacred; one’s house of a lifetime is swept away by a flood; one loses one’s job and is turned onto the street; one is malnourished; one contracts a debilitating disease. Sometimes suffering simply designates the experience of such objective calamities, withoutreferring to the psychological state of the people concerned.",

The chapter begins by showing how Tom both absorbs and escapes his source in Harsnett's exorcism pamphlet. It then offers a series of alternative historical frames in which to understand Tom—past, contemporary, and future—each of which Tom speaks or embodies: 1) Plotinus's concept of privational matter; 2) child mortality; 3) existing without any latency, purely present; 4) a dinosaur-world, before law or contract or family; 5) a primal condition of war; 6) original sin or law; 7) subjecthood waiting to possess the sublime body of sovereignty; 8) bare life becoming political life; 9) on the cusp of temptation and fall, at once before and after; 10) constitutionally anachronous, prone to futures; and 11) Holocaust, as sacrifice or as witness, dying or surviving to be an example.",

      "title": "Nonsynchronism and the Obligation to Its Dialectics",
      "abstract": "Not all people exist in the same Now. They do so only externally, by virtue of the fact that they may all be seen today. But that does not mean that they are living at the same time with others. Rather, they carry earlier things with them, things which are intricately involved. One has one's times according to where one stands corporeally, above all in terms of classes. Times older than the present continue to effect older strata; here it is easy to return or dream one's way back to older times. Certainly, a person who is simply awkward and who for that reason is not up to the demands of his position, is only personally unable to keep up. But what if there are other reaons why he does not fit into a very modern organization, such as the after-effects of peasant descent, what if he is an earlier type? In general, different years resound in the one that has just been recorded and prevails. Moreover, they do not emerge in a hidden way as previously but rather, they contradict the Now in a very peculiar way, awry, from the rear. The strength of this untimely course has become evident; it promised nothing less than new life, despite its looking to the old. Even the masses flock to it since the unbearable Now at least seems different with Hitler, who paints good old things for everyone. There is nothing more unexpected, nothing more dangerous than this power of being at once fiery and puny, contradicting and nonsynchronous. The workers are no longer alone with themselves and the bosses. Many earlier forces, from quite a different Below, are beginning to slip between.",

      "abstract": "In multi-cellular organisms--and hence also in man--aging and dying is the fate of the soma, i.e., the body proper; germ cells are--at least in principle--immortal. As the soma can be considered to be the \"service compartment\" of the germ cells, it loses its function once a species' phase of reproduction is over. Hence, there is an intimate relationship between reproduction and aging, and therefore also between a species' reproductive strategy and aging: there has been no selection for maintenance of the soma beyond the reproductive phase of life (when there is no reproduction, there is also no natural selection). As a consequence, mechanisms, important for maintenance of the soma during the reproductive phase, increasingly begin to fail once this phase is over, resulting in an accumulation of all kinds of pathology and genetic errors, rendering an individual increasingly more prone to a variety of (internal and external) attacks. In the end, the soma collapses, be it due to organ failure, a neoplasm or to a final external push, e.g., an infection.",

Events in which vibrating objects or interacting bodies disturb a surrounding medium in a wave-like manner best satisfy the desiderata for a theory of sounds. Such medium-disturbing events are individuated primarily in terms of spatio-temporal continuity. Worries about the metaphysical status of relational or causal events and about the perceptibility of medium-disturbing events are answered.",
